We should [treat it with as much respect] as our bowls.

Qantaput man’a wangkuta ner’aqamta
Our bowls, when we eat

81

Tamaani-w’ ciuqvani qantangqetulliniami yuk atauciq qantani tua-i murilkelluku pillilria.
It’s probably because a person back then had one bowl that [s]he watched
over.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Kenekluku tua-i, kencikluku.

To revere our land and the water as much as our bowls.

We these days are destroying ourselves.

89
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Unguvarput una navgualliniarput, temvut-llu una navgualliniarput.
We are apparently destoring our lives, and destroying our bodies.

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,900
Mat’ukun-llu wiinga aturyulallruaqa cakneq man’a taangaq.

94
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,900
Arcaqerluni inerciigatellrunricaaqngameng tamaani
Because they were especially well-behaved back then

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Iliini piqalria mistutullruuq.
One who occasionally [misbehaved] was clearly noticable.

Mat’um nalliini unuaquaqan ping’e’rmi qaillun wangkuta ellirtukut.
These days, though it happens every day, we have become [worse].

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,900
Wangkuta-ll’ tua-i tegganerni camek qanyuirucamta.
It’s also because we elders do not say anything anymore.

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,900
Avani ciuqvaarni qanqautetullruit amllermek pinrilnge’rmegteki.

Tua-i anglanitekevkenateng.
They didn’t do it excessively.

100
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,900
Qasgimi-llu cali quyurcelluta iliini qanqautetullruitkut.
They would also sometimes gather us in the community house and speak to us.

101

Cali-llu yaani Moravian-aat ciuqliit au͡gkut Kass’at quyurrluta iliini qalarutetullruitkut.
And over there, the first Caucasian Moravians would sometimes gather us and speak to us.

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,900
Mat’um nalliini tayima pilaryaaqut.
These days, they probably do that sometimes.

They’ve started speaking mostly in English now.

But youpl young people know that well.

108
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Wangkuta ciuqvaarni avani elluarrluta elitnaurumanrilamta
Because we back then did not have a thorough education

109
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Qitevquralriit tang wiinga taringyuitanka
I don’t understand people who speak completely in English

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Ilait tua-i agtuqa’aqluki piurangramki.
Even though I touch on some of them.

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,900
Tua-i-wa aptaqluten pinga.
Ask me questions.

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000

Back then, this was the most important one they said:

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000

They would tell us to help these people that were struggling or that were unable.

Nallurlung’e’rmeng-am pitullrulliniat Ellam Yuanek.
Though the poor people didn’t know, they called it the Spirit of the Universe.

Tau͡gaam yuum cali amllerem maa-i atunriraa.
But many people also don’t adhere to them anymore.

169
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Wangkuta-w’ tua-i ciulirnerurtellriani qanyuirucamta.
It’s because we who have become elders do not speak anymore.

170
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Tuqulriatun ayuquq qanrutestailami, qanrutkenrilami.
It’s like it’s dead because no one talks about it.

171

Wiinga elluarrlua pinricaaqua waniwa.
I am not doing well right now.

174
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Ukurmiuni avaqlimteńi Urucararmiuni ukunek Kass’anek tangvagluta ellangamta
Because we of Urucararmiut around here grew up watching Caucasians

175
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,500
Murilkessagucamta avaqlimcetun ava-i ayuqenritukut wangkuta.
Because we started observing them, we are not like those around us.

But because those around us watched well

177
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,900

Also, from what I heard about the community house back then

181
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Erpailgan ciulirneq, ciulirneq-wa tua-i iliit qanerturatullrulliniami
Before dawn, because one of the elders would always speak

182
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,900
Tan’gerem iluani tua-i tupagaqameng.
In the darkness when they woke up.

Tamaa-i tamaani ciuliaput elluarrluteng yuungatellrulliniut anglaninrilnge’rmeng.
It seems that our ancestors back then lived well though they weren’t frivolous.

We weren’t like this

186

Nothing was taken lightly.

187
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Neqa-llu, neqkun-llu man’a Kass’artaq anglanarqellrunrituq.
And food, Western food was not in excess.

188
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Enuqliqu’urrlainarnganani ayuqucingqellrulliniuq.
It seems that it was always scarce.

189
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Mat’um nalliini maa-i unuaquaqan sun’icaurtaakut tengssuutmek au͡gkunek.
These days, those planes bring us cargo every day.

190

Avani malrurqurrlainaagnek tua-i sun’it’laraat up’nerkami uksuarmi-llu.
Back then, they would only bring them cargo twice, in the spring and fall.

191

Man’a tua-i Kusquqvak kangillilluku payugcecullrullinii, un’a-ll’ unani Caninermek pitukiit.
It would bring stuff all the way to the mouth of the Kuskokwim, and what they call Canineq down there.

192
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Sun’agnek malrugnek up’nerkami, uksuarmi.
Only two barges in the spring, fall.

193
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Taumek ava-i au͡gkut tua-i yull’urluut, carrluaraat, Kassaunge’rmeng-llu
That's why those Yupiit of old, no matter who they were, even Caucasians.

194
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Murilkeńganaku anglanitekevkenaku-llu pitullrulriit.
They carefully watched and didn’t take things lightly.

Our ancestors back then wouldn’t talk about Western things, only mines.

Kass’aq tua-i mine-amek piaqluku, mine-allernek-llu qanraqluteng.
They would call the Western thing a mine, and they would talk about old mines.

197
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Kass’amek qanerpakayuitut wiinga murilkellemni maani.
They didn’t speak too much about Western things here in my observation.

This is what I think they did:

199
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Au͡gkut Kass’at akinek yuarturalallret pitekluku tamaani.
Those Caucasians were looking to make money back then.

200
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Caliarkaq enurnallruuq tamatum nalliini.
There were not many jobs at that time.

201

Neqsurarang’e’rmeng cali neqalleruaq man’a akikurluku, ima-llu-q’ akituaqluni?
Though they always fished, this fish was their currency, and wasn’t it expensive?

202
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Ataucirqumek murilkellemni iqalluuk malruk waten kangirassullrulriik.
Once in my observation, two chums like this cost two quarters.

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Tamaani nalliini cat akitullrunritut tau͡gaam.
But things were not expensive at that time.

Kass’am pia amllerpek’nani, watuam nalliitun ayuqevkenani.
There weren’t many Western things, not like now.

Tau͡gaam man’a Yugtaq neqa nangyaqnganaku yuullruut piitellerkaa.
But they lived seemingly in fear that this Yup’ik food would become scarce.

210

Au͡g’um-llu qanrutesteḿa pitullrukiinga neqem nalliini qavaasqevkenii.
My instructor also used to tell me not to sleep during food gathering season.

Though he asked me, I refused him at first

Because I felt constrained since I abused alcohol so heavily.

223

…ksaitaqa agayu[?].
…I didn’t [?] him [?] the church.
