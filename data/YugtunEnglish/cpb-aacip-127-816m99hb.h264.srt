They set this time period: they tell the one they’re trying to save not to use a knife for five days.

Then since it’s true, he obeys one who believes him.

248
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:16,512
Piciatun, akusrarutnguluni tau͡gaam atullrunritliniat.
But they didn’t practice it frivolously in any old way.

249
00:31:16,512 --> 00:31:23,042
Tuunritarkateng, qasgimi tuunrilrianek tangtullruunga cauyarluteng.
The one they’re going to use their shaman power on, I used to see shamans call upon their helping spirits with drums in the community house.

00:31:23,812 --> 00:31:26,772
Tua-lli-wa-gguq tamaani ciungani

Then they said that when (s)he was sometimes [healed] well, those two worked together on his impurities

They got rid of all of his impurities.

254

They also spoke about that staff as a life[line] for a person.

260
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:59,592
Cali-llu waniw’ ukut arcaqerluki alerquutektullrit:
Also, this was one of their important instructions:

Iciw’ imarnitet wangkuta Yugcetun, au͡gkut avani makunek Kass’artarnek pingvailegmek tamakut tua-i tamaa-i imarnitet atutullrulliniit.
You know, [what we call] imarnitet in Yup’ik, people used to use those seal gut rain parkas back then before they had Western raingear.

262
00:33:14,397 --> 00:33:19,992
Tua-i-llu wangkuta Kass’angumariluku maa-i yuurtellriani
Then for those of us who were born after Western contact

Angayumta alerqutullruitkut tua-i tamakut tua-i tamaa-i ellalliurcuutet arcaqerluki qelkesqelluki wangkutnun ella assirngalengraan.
Our parents used to instruct us to especially keep our raingear with us even if the weather looked good.

264
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:42,162
Tua-i iliini waten iquklicuilan ella up’nerkami wall’u uksuarmi
Since the weather sometimes doesn’t end the way it started in the spring or fall

265
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:52,222
Tua-i taukut tua-i tamaa-i arcaqerluki wangkutnuun avaliqesqelluki pitullruit.
They would tell us to especially have those with us.

266
00:33:52,222 --> 00:34:01,442
Tua-i ayarumek piilkumta tua-i, qaillun nallumciqngamteggu-wa tua-i, cam-llu aarnarqucia nalluluku.
If we don’t have a walkin gstick, since we fumble around, and we don’t know how dangerous something is.

267
00:34:01,817 --> 00:34:13,147
Wall’u uksumi ayagakumta qanikciurun ucikerrlainarluku cali ella assingraan pisqelluta.
Or if we travel in the winter, they would tell us to always carry a shovel though the weather is good.

268
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:19,857
Arenqiallugeskumta cunawa yuilqumi wall’u pirtunguskakut
It turned out that if we got into misfortune in the wilderness, or a blizzard starts on us

269
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:30,672
Ellaqerruskakut tua-i cali alerquutekluku agnermun, agellranun-wa tua-i arulairesqevkenata.
When the weather turns on us, they also instruct us not to stop at a small snowbank.

270
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:35,892
Tau͡gaam-llu tua-i camek kangciramek-llu piilkumta
But they also said that if we don’t have a tarpaulin

271
00:34:35,897 --> 00:34:44,967
Qanikciurutengqerqumta qengaruk ak’a qengaruurtelleq, tauna elagluku
If we have a shovel, dig into a snowbank that’s already formed

272
00:34:46,487 --> 00:34:50,057
Iluani tua-i tuani uitasqelluta.
They told us to stay in that.

273
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:56,472
Tau͡gaam cali muragmek kapsuutekaanek tauna piluku.
But also, we should get a wooden [staff] to poke a hole in that.

274
00:34:56,472 --> 00:35:01,772
Kiiriaqan kapurluku elcetaqluku.
When it gets hot, poke holes to let the [stale] air out.

275
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:12,997
Tua-i tamaa-i tamakut arcaqerluki wangkuta alerquutekellruaput, au͡gkunun-wa tua-i ciuliamteńun.
Those were the important traditional instructions given to us from our ancestors back then.

276
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:43,957
Waten-am umyuangua up’nerkaq kiagniararluku:
I had this thought last spring on the verge of summer:

277
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:51,290
"Angu ataki tang pavavet pissualallma iliinun kiakan
"Oh my, one of my old hunting grounds inland, when summer sets

278
00:35:52,470 --> 00:36:00,890
"Aguutekun levaacuaralegkun tamana tarritelallma iliit tangerrsartuqaqerlaku."
"Let me go see one of the places I’d walk around with an open canoe with a small motor."

279
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:12,675
Tua-i-llu kiagan cikuirucan Tuulkessaarmiut kiatiitgun Tevyarakun tevluta Elaayiim kangranun.
Then when there was no more ice in the summer, we portaged through Tevyaraq upriver from Tuluksak to the headwaters of Elaayak.

280
00:36:12,685 --> 00:36:15,905
We went downriver from there.
We went downriver from there.

281
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,750
Cetuinanemteńi pengulkumek tekitaqamta arulairlua nacetaqlua.
When we came across a larger hill as we went downriver, I’d stop and look from that vantage point.

282
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,750
Nacetaqama tekitnaurtua uumek pop-autellermek.
When I went to look from that vantage point, I’d come across this empty pop can.

283
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:42,350
Maani-llu kuigmi levaarinanemni tangerrnaurtua napat avayaitni plastic-aaq tevingaluni.
And as I traveled this river with a boat motor, I would see a plastic [bag] draped over tree branches.

284
00:36:42,355 --> 00:36:45,015
Tuavet nagingalliniluni.
It was stuck there.

285
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,800
Tamakunek tangaalua.
I kept seeing those.

286
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:52,595
Qaillun-llu umyuarteqeksaunii ciuqlirmi tangengellemni.
And I didn’t think anything when I first started seeing them.

287
00:36:52,605 --> 00:37:03,835
Kiituani tang avani uaqsigiluta nacetellrenka tamalkuita pop-autengqerran, pop-autellernek pitangqerran
Eventualy, you see, as we were far downriver over there, because there were empty pop cans in every vantage point I looked from

288
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:16,305
Umyuangua, "All’ atam wangkuta makut irniaput cakneq-lli uqlaussiyaagpaa, ciuliamcetun pivkenateng."
I had the thought, "Oh my, look at how messy our children are, not like our ancestors."

289
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,790
Ukuugut arcaqerluteng: pop-autellret, plastic-aat
This are the most prominent: empty pop cans, plastic bags

290
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,090
Atsiyaryaraitni-wa terr’ilitat cali
In their berry-picking grounds are also diapers

291
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:37,640
Qavartallrit-llu carangllirlainarluteng, qemagngavkenateng tamakut.
And their camping grounds are always filled with debris, without those being put away.

292
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:45,505
Avani tang ciuliamteńi nuna man’a menuunani.
Long ago in our ancestors’ time, you see, this land was pristine.

293
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,950
Carangllugtaunani. Tamakunek pitaunani.
There was no debris. There was none of that.

294
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,290
Pop-autellernek, cavilqunek, plastic-aanek, terr’ilitallernek-llu pitaunani.
There were no empty pop cans, metal things, plastic things, or used diapers.

295
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,620
Tamakut-llu pinginanratni kuvyallernek cali
And eventually, there were also old drift nets

296
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:14,695
Maani tayima kangitmun Kusquqvak, Akula-llu paug͡na tuaten uksurpak civingallernek.
Here on to the headwaters of the Kuskokwim, and in Akula inland, [nets] that were set all winter.

297
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:21,600
Uqlarluteng, uqlauciluteng neqnek, nuna-llu man’a uqlarluku.
They’re polluted, pollute nature with fish, and pollute the land.

298
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:30,210
Akwaugaq-llu au͡gna Matthew Beans-aaq qanemcillermini qanemciuq waten:
And yesterday, when Matthew Beans was telling his stories, he told this story:

299
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:34,135
Tengaurcuutekun-gguq nunanun ayagaaqami
He said that when he travels to villages by plane

300
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:44,520
Nunat mallgiaqamiki tamakunek plastic-aanek kalikallernek tangaangelartuq, nunat mallgiaqamiki
When he gets close to villages, he sees a lot of those plastic bags and cardboard things, when he gets close to villages

301
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,190
Anuqem pirtukluki ayagatellri.
The things the wind blew like a blizzard.

302
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:57,245
Waten tang umyuangellrulrianga wiinga up'nerkaq tamaaggun tamakunek tangerpakallemni:
I had this idea last spring when I saw too many of those when I traveled through there:

303
00:38:57,255 --> 00:39:05,675
Qanrutkarkaurrluki agayuvigmi, wall'u agayuviunrilengraan tamakut apertuagarkaurrluki.
That I should talk about those in church, or that I should point those out even if it's not at church.

304
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:42,980
Ciuliaput menuitellruut, nunaseng man'a kencikluku clean up-aarumarrlainarluku.
Our ancestors were clean, always keeping their land here cleaned up out of reverence.

305
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:45,565
Piinanermeggni-llu
And as they did that

306
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:56,760
Merteng Kusquqvak, Kusquqvaunrilengraan, nanvat, kuiggaat-llu kencikluki uqlarcetevkenaki.
They also didn't pollute their water out of reverence, the Kuskokwim, even if it wasn't the Kuskokwim, the lakes and creeks.

307
00:39:56,765 --> 00:40:00,205
Nuna-llu piyararteng uqlarcetevkenaku.
They also didn't let their hunting-gathering lands become polluted.

308

Clean up-aarumarrlainarluku ciuliamta waten qanerluteng: "Ellam Yuan tangvagaakut."
Our ancestors always kept it cleaned up, saying this: "The Spirit of the Universe is watching us."

309
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:15,045
Cipciyuunata-gguq Ellam Yuan tangvagaakut.
They say the Spirit of the Universe watches us, without leaving anyone out.

310
00:40:15,055 --> 00:40:21,925
Bible-aani naaqilartut tayima elisngalruut, wiinga-llu naaqilartua.
Those who are knowledgeable read the Bible, and I read it too.

311
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:25,445
Psalms 24-aami waten qanertuq:
It says this in Psalms 24:

312
00:40:25,455 --> 00:40:35,175
"Agayutem nuna pikaa, tamakunelnguut-llu tamalkuita tuani-llu enengqellriit tamalkuita elliin pikai."
"To Jehovah belong the earth and that which fills it, the productive land and those dwellingin it." [NWT]

313
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:43,530
Nakleng wangkuta mat’um nalliini nunamteńek uqlarilriani.
How pitiful, we who pollute our land these days.

314
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:54,810
Ukvelrianek aterpagingaluta, ukvelriaruciqukut-qaa air-arput nunaput-llu uqlarluku?
Calling ourselves believers, will we be believers who pollute our air and lands?

315
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:04,210
Maaten umyuangcartua, ukvelriani wangkuta tuaten air-angqerrngaitellinilriakut.
I pondered and realized that we believes will not have [polluted] air like that.

316
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:11,580
Nunavut, uitavigput uksumi, pissurviput-llu yuilqumi
Our land, where we stay in the winter, and our hunting grounds in the wilderness

317
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:18,375
Enecetun clean up-aarumalriatun ayuqevkararkauyaaqelliniarput
We must keep it like a cleaned up house

318
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:24,805
Wangkuta air-arput-ll’, pissuryaraput, neqsurviput, Kusquqvagput-llu.
And our air, our hunting grounds, our fishing grounds, and our Kuskokwim River.

319
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:32,700
Mat’um-llu nalliini ayainanemni Kusquqvagkun tangerrnaurtua pop-autelleq man’a at’reskii.
And these days, as I go on the Kuskokwim, I would see an empty pop can drifting down here.

320
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:39,375
Amta-llu nerangnaqvikluku, akingengnaqvikluku-llu.
And yet, it’s our food source, and our income source.

321
00:41:39,385 --> 00:41:43,505
Ik’atak’ qalquni qaillun piciqa?
How foul, what will happen when it rusts?

322
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,620
Au͡gkut tang ciuliaput waten qanelriit:
You see, our ancestors back then said this:

323
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:51,915
Makut-gguq neqet cumacitartut.
They said that these fish are easily repulsed.

Our ancestors gave that instruction to keep the land that they saw here pristine.

I got the intention to say that when I returned home from my travels last spring.

424

With [the land] polluted like this, our caretaker, and the creator and owner of the land cannot bless it.

Tamaa-i tamana.
There you have it.

They only have their eyes on money these days.

430
00:58:24,174 --> 00:58:29,544
Avani tau͡gken ciuliamteńi aki tangvanritaat.
In our ancestors’ time back then, however, they didn’t look at money.

431
00:58:30,454 --> 00:58:37,894
Una tau͡gaam akaarnun yuuqallerkarteng kiingan tangvagaat au͡gkut ciuliamta.
Instead, our ancestors back then kept their eyes on how they could live for a long time.

432
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:42,329
Waten ayuqut:
They were like this:

433
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:53,199
Nunani, nunameggni canegmek naumalriartangqerrsuunaku.
In their villages, they didn’t let grass grow.

440
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:35,489
"Caranglliuryunqeggluten, clean up-aaryunqeggluten yuukina aki umyuaqevkenaku. Akituuq clean up-aarilleq.
"Live your life with a propensity do [clean up] debris, to clean up without thinking of money. Cleaning up is expensive.

"Waten ciunren, ukatmun takuyallren tamarmi neqkangqerrnaurtuq.
"So that in the future, when you look back, you will have food every time.

442

"Tuamta-llu neqtangqerrnginanrani tuaten ciunren, akaarnun unguvaqerciquten nunami."
"Then as there is food like that in your future, you will live for a long time on earth."

443
00:59:53,524 --> 00:59:56,564
Akqutii tamaa-i clean up-aaryaram.
That is the promise of cleaning up.

444
00:59:56,579 --> 00:59:59,959
Anirtima ellangellemni avani
It’s no wonder that in my earliest memories back then

445
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:09,894
Arnassagarnek angukara’urlurnek-llu tangaatuunga ciisquteng ayaperluki piyuanaurtut, nengesciiganateng.
I saw old women and old men walking by supporting themselves on their knees, unable to stretch out [to full height].

446
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:16,584
Angukara’urluurtem arnassagaurtellrata-llu ugaani tuaten pivkarluki.
They were such old men and old women that they did that.

447

It turned out that because our ancestors, even women, would clean up their village

448
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:34,389
Akaarnun yuuqatullinilriit, ciisquteng-ll’ ayaperluki tarricaurrluteng.
They would live a long time, and start walking by supporting themselves with their knees.

449
01:00:34,399 --> 01:00:40,069
Tamaa-i clean up-aalriim akiliutii.
That’s the reward for one who cleans up.

450
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,899
Tuamta-llu qanengssagnek waten qanernaurtut:
Then they would tell these stories:

451
01:00:43,904 --> 01:00:54,084
Una-gguq nukalpiaq ilamitun ayuqevkenani, enuqlilluni. Aterluni-llu Picuilngurmek.
They say this man in his prime was not like his peers, lacking. And his name was Picuilnguq [Bad Hunter].

452
01:00:54,509 --> 01:00:58,029
Pitengnaq’nge’rmi-ll’ pitesciiganani.
And though he hunted, he couldn’t catch anything.

453
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:04,004
Tamakut-gguq-am ilait ayariluteng makunek piculrianek
They say that some of those who desire to be like these good hunters

They start cleaning up their villages though no one tells them to.

455

Being ashamed of being bad hunters, they start cleaning up those villages.

456
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:26,159
Tuaten piameng, tamana atu’urqamegteggu
When they do that, when they practice that

457
01:01:26,169 --> 01:01:38,889
Imkut nukalpianek piculinek-llu atellget amatairluki picunrurtaqluni tauna tuaten ayuqellria clean up-aarteńgurtaqami.
One who does that becomes a better hunter than those who are called great hunters, and those who catch a lot, when he cleans up.

458
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:54,388
Waniwaulliniuq: Agayutem nunani, elliin pini carriucia taumun yugmun quyam ugaan piyullrinek akililallinia, akingutekluku.
This is what it is: since God is thankful for that person who cleans up his land, he rewards him with what he wants, and he receives that reward.

459
01:01:54,388 --> 01:02:01,388
Unguvaan taktaciatun tuaten ayuqevkararkauluku, enuqlitevkenaku yuuluku.
He will make him like that for the length of his life, living without being in need.

460
01:02:01,395 --> 01:02:05,333
Clean up-aarturalleq man’a akituqa[piaralliniuq].
Cleaning up brings great rewards.
