They set this period of time: they told the ones they were trying to save not to use a knife for five days.

220
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:41,300
Tua-i tuaten.
Like that.

221
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:49,701

Look, they said, some people, since it’s true

Kelgulluku. Taun’-gguq naken tekitaquq. Pistii tang yuaraqaa.
[The shaman] invites him. They say he arrives from somewhere. You see, he looks for who invited him.

But also, back then in the distant past

241
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:11,812
