Clothes, and all food, everything was scarce for us.

Makut civuqliit pingnatullrat nalluku
They don’t know how these ancestors worked hard to survive

For them, sometimes, my mind wants to say something thinking like this:

24
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:24,956
"Wangkutneng taqellrunritukut. Agayutem piliaqelqaakut. Tauna pinrilengramku canrituq."
"We didn’t create ourselves. God made us. It’s okay if I don’t say anything to him."

25
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,497
Atam Agayun pilillruun elliin yugkaminek pikaminek.
You see, God made people for himself.
