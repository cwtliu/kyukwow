Oh my, I was like that. I just told you the story.

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,890
Ayagtukuk-qaa? Assiriuq?
Are we going? Is it better?

3
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:25,125
Kitak’, kitak’ makut wani assilriit qanernailnguut angalkuut canek calilallruat?
So now, how did these good shamans that didn’t needed to be scolded work?

4
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:30,275
Yugnek tuunriskenglallruut assirivkaraqluki
They would use their shamanistic powers on people to heal them

00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:37,255
Naulluulrianek-llu tuunriskengaqameng assirivkaraqluki camek iquaraunaki.
And when they use their shamanistic powers on the sick to heal them without side effects.

6
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:42,815
Assirivkaraqluki cayugnairucelluki.
They heal them so there was nothing left wrong with them.

00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:52,610
Wani-llu qasgimi tuunriaqameng imkut umyuarrlulriit yuk tauna pillrulliniaqatgu
And when they exercised their shamanistic powers in the community house on a person whom [others] had [attacked] with malice

8
00:00:52,610 --> 00:01:06,120
Angalkut ilait camek-wa catailnguq man’ teguarkamek-llu catailnguq waten tua-i talliteng piqerluki cayuurata
Some shamans, when they were faced with something invisible that they could take, when they did this with their arms and pulled what was invisible

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,280
Cayuuqengarkailnguut-wa camek.
Yet they had nothing [physical] to pull.

10
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:16,175
Cayuurata angalkut-ll’ iliit taklainanermini makqetaaraqluni.
As one of the shamans kept pulling, they’d get pulled up as they lay there.

Tua-i-gguq tauna taum naulluulriim naulluuvkartii
They said that what had been making that sick person sick

The ones that they did that to couldn’t deny it happened as they were there.

13
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,580
Makqetaalalriit meci’irviinateng uitalallrulliniut.
Those that were pulled up like that would stay without being able to deny that it had happened.

14
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:45,415
Qaillun-llu pillrunritniluku qanerviinateng.
And they couldn’t say that nothing had happened.

15
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,125
Tua-i.
There you have it.

16
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:55,100
Tuaten tua-i yuut amlleret cali qinuciaratullruut.
Many of those people would experience delirium before death like that.

Ilaita angalkut makut qanernaarailnguut tuunritaqamegteki-llu
When some shamans who did not need apprehending exercised their shamanistic powers on them

They’d forgive them, confess them to those malicious shamans.

19
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,390
Tuaten tua-i ayuqellruut.
That’s what they were like.

20
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:15,615
Naivvluki, ellaitnun tunluki
They would confess unto them

21

Nalluatgun-llu wall’u maaggun tua-i naw’un tangrrumanrilngurkun tua-i ellaita tua-i atungaqluku tuaten umyuarrlullerteng.
Without their knowledge, or with some unknown force, they’d experience their own malicious intent.

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,260
Ellaita tua-i ellaitnun tut’aqluni umyuarrlullrat.
Their malicious intent would fall upon them.

23
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:39,315
Tuaten ayuqellruut.
That’s what they were like.

24
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:45,485
Tua-i qaqilluki-llu nallunritenrilkenka

But I used to hear about some of them like this.

00:02:50,115 --> 00:03:02,305
Ii-i, kitak’ ellangyugallerpeni imumi tayima, arcaqerluku una erneq tekilluku
Okay, so when you were growing up back then, especially up to this day

27
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:11,225
Qanruyun eneqak’ngan cali, cali umyuarpeni mistuluni uitalria qanrutkeqerru
Traditional wisdom that you remember, please talk about one that is still clear in your mind

28
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,610
Qanruyutet niitelalten imumi avani nasaurlullraullerpeni ciuliarpenek.
The traditional wisdom you used to hear back from your elders back when you were a girl.

29
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:25,275
Atam, avani tang ciuqvaarni
You see, a long time ago

30
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:36,880
Qalarutestemta imkut qalarutetullrukaitkut tuar tang nunulriit.
Our instructors back then would instruct us, and it seemed they were scolding.

31
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:48,540
Wangkurlumta niicugninaurtukut pekviirulluta aqumluta, kiiryungluta-llu, unateput-llu mecungengluteng.
We poor people would listen, unable to move as we sat, getting hot, and our hands would get wet.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,850
Pek’arrviirulluta qanrutaqatkut.
We couldn’t move anymore when they instructed us.

33
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:55,981
Waten imum aanama pitullruanga:
This is what my mother used to say to me:

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,500
"Kitak’ qanrutestevnek niiskuvet qanrutestevet qanra tangvakiu taqvianun.
"Now, when you hear someone instructing you, watch you instructor’s mouth until [s]he stops.

35
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:12,069
"Tuaten-llu pingalengraaten ulu’urteksaunaku taqvianun qanrakun tangvalaqiu."
"And though he seems to be directing at you, don’t look away from them, and watch their mouth until they’re done."

36
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:19,607
Tua-i alerquasteka call’ aturluku tuatnalallruunga.
I’d also follow what my instructor said and do that.

37
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:29,676
"Nunurngalengraaten tangvaurqiu qanrakun. Taqkaten tau͡gaam nutaan ulurluku."
"Though [s]he seems to scold you, watch their mouth. Only when [s]he’s done, look away."

38
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:32,552
Tuatnalallruunga.
I would do that.

39
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:41,389
Ilumun tuatnatulleq yuk qanruyutellminek nalluyaguciyuitelliniuq.
Truly, a person who was there should not forget the traditional wisdom passed down to them.

40
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,095
Maa-i pekviirulluta niicugnilalluukut.
We'd listen without being able to move.

41
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:57,001
Taqkacagaakut tau͡gaam taum qanrucilriim nutaan tua-i nangerrluta tua-i unitaqluku.
Only when they they were done, that instructor, would we stand and leave them.

42
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:05,220
Taqeqapiariikut tau͡gaam unilluku nangertaqluku, taqeqaqakut tau͡gaam.
Only when [s]he finished with us, we’d stand away from them, only when [s]he finished with us.

43
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:14,814
Nunurnganata niicugninauput. Nekanaqnganateng, nunurnganateng pinaurtut.
We’d listen as they seemed to scold us. They’d seem to offend us, scold us.

44
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:23,564
Aren, maa-i tang ayuqucirtuutellrit tailait. Tekitaqamki elitaq’laqenka.
Oh my, I wish their traditional instructions would come. When I come upon them, I recognize them.

45
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:26,752
Elitaqaqluku ca tamalkuan.
I’d recognize everything.

46
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:34,096
Elitaqa’artaqluku imna qanerturalriit qanrutkvakalallrita ilait.
I’d so recognize what some instructors would speak of.

47
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:38,027
Caugat tamakut wani ilait qanruyutet?
What are some of those pieces of traditional wisdom?

48
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:42,558
Pulengtaarturluteng-llu qanrut’lallruitkut.
They’d also tell us repeatedly

49
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:49,759
Imna qanruyutellerteng egmirrluku cali pulenglluku call’ qanrutkaqluku
They’d also repeatedly tell that piece of traditional wisdom

50
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:59,572
Pulengtaarluku, ataucirqumek niicetevkenaku tau͡gaam pulengtaarturluku niicetaqluku.
Repeatedly, not letting them hear it once, but having them hear it repeatedly.

51
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:09,954
Aren, tua-i ilumun piciulriamek qanlallrulliniut au͡gkut ciuqliit yuut tua-i.
Oh my, the first people back then would speak of true things.

52
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:23,910
Taumek cali imna makunek call’ maa-i waten-llu imkulrianek, makunek-wa qaneryariurteńek ilaitnek Yugnek
That’s why when some of these people, when these Yupiit speak on the Bible

53
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:31,510
Au͡g’na-llu ciuqliq atuyunairutniluku qanelrianek niitaqama
And when I hear that the first doesnt need to be anymore

54
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:41,260
Wall’u au͡gna ciuqliq atuyunairutniluku qanelrianek niitaqama waten umyuarteq’lalrianga
Or when I hear people say the first shouldn’t be done, I think like this

55
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:47,535
Umyuaqeqalaqka Jesus-aaq waten qanellra:
I think of the fact that Jesus said this:

56
00:06:49,773 --> 00:07:02,486
"Wiinga waniwa Qaneryaraq alerquun piunrirrluku tekitenritua, tau͡gaam qaqicarturluku.
"I didn’t come to destroy the Law, but to complete it.

57
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:14,723
"Carraungraan man’a ciuqlirtaq inerquutellrunirtua watqapik tau͡gaa qaqicarturluku." Qanrutkellrua.
"I didn’t come to destroy a single part of it, but to complete it." That’s what he said.

58
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:22,792
Tua-i umyuaqellagturatuaqa waniwa waten qanellra uum Jesus-aam.
I always remember this, that Jesus said.

59
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:30,430
Tua-i waniw’, waniwa tang waniw’ elliama
So now, as I’m now this age

60
00:07:30,443 --> 00:07:41,518
Imkut qanruyutek’lallrenka tekitaqamki tua-i, yugnek-llu elitaqiaqama
When I come across that traditional wisdom, and when I recognize people

61
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:50,699
Imkut qanerturallrit qanrit tua-i elitaqa’arrnaunka qanlallrit.
I would recognize what those instructrs would say.

62
00:07:50,712 --> 00:08:05,462
Yuk-llu tauna tuaten qaillun ayuqeciqnilallrat tekitaqan tua-i imna qanrutkumalria tua-i eneqaqa'aqluku qaillun ayuqeciqnilallrat.
And when that person that they said would end up a certain way, when the time time, I'd remember what they said about what they'd be like.

63
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:09,706
Tua-i ayuqelallruut.
They were like that.

64
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:22,525
Tuamta-llu waniw' qanrusnginanrani qalarusnginanrani-llu yuut iliit nasaurluullgutenka-ll' iliit anngan avavialaraa.
Then as they're speaking and instructing them, when one person, and when one of my fellow girls went out, they'd [?decry] her.

65
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:27,951
"Alingnaqvaa tanem au͡g’umi. Ciin tanem au͡gna an’a?
"Oh my goodness that one. Why did they go out?

66
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:39,045
"Niicugniyuumiilami-wa tua-i ava-i anllilria elliin umyuani assikek’ni aturturluku yuunaluni.
"They probably went out since they didn’t want to listen in order to live with whatever whims they have.

67
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:45,420
"Assikek’ngani tekiskuniu yuvrirciqaa ellminek."
"When they come across what they liked, they’ll examine it for themselves."

68
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:49,908
Waten qanrutkaqluku.
They’d talk about them like that.

69
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:57,727
Assikek’ngaa tangerqaku elliinek tangerciqniluni.
When they see what they liked, they’ll see themself.

70
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,046
Tua-i waten pinauraat.
They’d say this about them.

71
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:13,577
Tua-i alerquutet au͡gkut ciuqliit assiilnguunritqapiartut.
Those first traditional instructions are absolutely not bad.

72
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:19,433
Taumek aturtellrit imkut yuunertuluteng-llu yuullrulriit.
That’s why the people who practiced them long ago lived long lives.

73
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:28,333
Pekcetaqaceteng-llu enruara’urluit cingqurruaqluteng. Tua-i-gguq enemeggnek yuuluteng.
And when they moved them, their old bones would pop. They said they went out of [socket].

74
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:33,439
Wall’ tegulautengqelallruut-llu tuntunek curuitnek.
Or, they also carried them on caribou antlers.

75
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:43,558
Cingqurrunaurtut. Tuamtellu enekaanun uitallerkaanun elliatni enruara’urlui tuar imkut nut’galalriit.
They’d pop. Then when they put them where they were going to be, their old bones would be like shooting guns.

76
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:46,996
Tua-i-gguq enemeggnun ekluteng.
They said they went back into place.

77
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,415

You see?

78
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:57,290
Ugaani uum yuuyaraq cupuirluku, unguvayaraq cupuirluku.
From being so [?tightly clung] to life, [?tightly clung] to being alive.

79
00:09:57,303 --> 00:10:00,978
Ilait-llu-gguq keggutengnaurtut.
And they said some grew a new set of teeth.

80
00:10:00,997 --> 00:10:09,034
Keggukarangelrianek tamakut pinaurait. Tuarpiaq-gguq keggutait imarmiucinraat.
They’d call them "those with small new teeth." They said they looked like mink teeth.

81
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:12,822
Tua-i-gguq keggukarangelriit.
They said those were "those with small new teeth."

82
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:18,516
Tua-i atak’ wiinga-llu-tuq waniw’ keggukaranglii keggutairutellrianga.
Well, I wish I could get small new teeth since I have no more.

83
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:23,266
Keggutairuqaarluteng-qaa tamakunek...
Were those after they lost their teeth...

84
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:27,872
Keggutairuqaarluteng tamakunek cimingaqluteng.
After they lost their teeth, they’d be replaced by those.

85
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:33,872
Aren, wiinga’urluq tang waniw’ au͡g’utun ayagyuallemtun ellilrianga
Oh poor me, I’ve become like when I was young

86
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:38,353
Ilngircetaqlua kegguteka una arulangaqan.
I’d have my tooth removed when it gets loose.

87
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:47,484
Waniwa-llu qavcin ukut arulalriit pingayun, arulangelriit.
Or, several of these, three, are starting to get loose.

88
00:10:47,885 --> 00:11:03,085
Tua-i man’a-llu qulirneq keggutailnguq, keggutairutellria atauciq wani keggutnguara, tuamta-ll’ man’a ukalirneq keggutairulluni, malruk-wa ukuk keggutek.
Then here on the top has no tooth, one without a tooth has a false tooth here, then this part has no more teeh, and two teeth here.

89
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:12,742
Man’a-llu atlirneq, kanani-w’ qukami atauciq keggun, ukut-wa tang qavcirraan waniwa uatiini.
And the bottom here, there’s one tooth down in the middle, and several teeth out from there.

90

Akia tau͡gken man’a atlirneq man’a cali ilangarteksailnguaqtarluteng.
The other side, however, on the bottom hasn’t lost any.

91

Tamakut-qaa yuunertullret ava-i qanelriaten cingqurruaqluteng enrit.
Those people who lived long, you just said their bones would pop.

92
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:32,593
(Yuunialallruut-qaa aknirqelluteng?) Yuuniarayuunateng.
(Would they complain of aches?) They wouldn’t complain.

93

Akngirrngalnge’rmeng yuuniarayuunateng.
Though they seemed in pain, they wouldn’t complain.

They wouldn’t go "ouch" though they seemed in pain.

95
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:47,288
Enrit-wa cingqurrulriit tuar nut’galalriit.
Their bones would pop like guns firing.

Elliaqaceteng-llu tua-i mengqullagangnaurtut.
And when they put them down, they’d make loud noises.

They said their joints would go back in from where they came out.

Oh my, and our dear grandmother, poor thing, when we were going to move and they moved her from her mat with caribou antlers, she would do that.

Her old bones would pop in what they said they were going back in place.
