We must make incinerators and burn paper products.

228
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Cavilput-llu teq’ernarqaput Kusquqvamteńun mermun egtevkenaki
We should also bury our metal [trash] into pits,
not throw them into the water of our Kuskokwim River

229
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Qallran neqairuciiqngakut tamana Kusquqvak.
Because we will have no more fish on the Kuskokwim when that rusts.

Tamaa-i tamana arcaqerluku wangkuta murilkarkaqerput.

We are called [Christian] believers these days.

If we are believers, we would always clean up land that is not ours.

233

Agayutmun wangkutnun navriutekaa assirluku atuusqelluku wangkutnun.
We should properly use what God has lent to us.

But we do not understand this days.

235
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000

It’s probably because the young people speak English.

236
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,000
Tamatum cairtutellriatun ayuqaakut.
It’s like that depriving us of everything.

And cleaning up our land out of respect through faith.

240
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:37,800

You see, this is how our ancestors back then treated this land
that they used:

241
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,000
Yuilqurrungraan enemegcetun qigcikluku.
They would respect even the wilderness as their own houses.

242
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:53,000
Tuamta-llu merteng Kusquqvak pissuryarateng-llu,
taluyaryarateng-llu can’giircuryarateng qigcikluki.
And then, they also respecting the Kuskokwim, their water where they
subsist, and the places where they trap blackfish.

243
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:03,500
Watqapik-llu cikutesqevkenaki aruisqevkenaki-llu neqnek

And they would never let them freeze or spoil [what they had caught] saying that the fish traps would not get fish anymore.

244

Tuatnalriit amllerrata watua maa-i, kuvyanek-llu aruilrianek

Because there is a lot of that now, and drift nets spoiling [catch],
the fish are depleting.

Tamaaggun taringnarqaakut wangkuta Agayutmek aniqlaamacirput.
We must understand that God has cursed us through that.

Camek enuryugcingiinarluta, neqkanek-llu enuryugciriinarluta

We have worsening shortages of things, shortages of fish,
the food that we are given.

Angu ataki tang umyuallgutekluta tamamta ciulirnerni

[about traditional wisdom] on the radio.

Tua-i-ll’ piluni ellii umyuarteqniluni waten:
And then she said that this is what she thought:

When one of their peers misbehaved, your late wife
would gather them all and admonish them.

301
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,500

Child rearing is also part of the traditional wisdom
from our ancestors back then.

Avani atama wiinga anglicallruanga, pinarqaqama-wa pilallikiinga tayima

My father raised me back then, and probably when I needed it,

“Ilavceńi quyinruluci yuuyaqunaci. Kingunerraatgun tau͡gaam yuukici.”
“Do not despise your peers in life. Instead, humble yourselves
before them in life.”

Au͡gna qanruyun nutem aturluku yuukilta-gguq ilamta canek

Adhering to that ancient piece of wisdom, our pride should be
as much as what they tread upon in our live.

Canegtun tutmaqiicetun umyuarput quyigivkenaku.
Let us be as humble as the grass they tread upon.

When I had children my father said to me, “You are now a father.

“I will not teach or instruct you.

“Ak’a ayuqucirtullruamkun uumun irniavnun

“I have already instructed you on what you should
pass on to your child whom you love.

“Wiinga-llu qalarut’lallruamken wii pikenrilkemnek.
“I have also talked to you about what has not originated from me.

“I’ve passed on my father’s traditional wisdom onto you.

“You are doing that, but I will watch you.
I will admonish you when you warrant it.”

316
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,500
Tua-i-llu waten: “Irniat ayuqsuitut.”
And then this: “Children are different.”

317
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Waniwa nine-aanek yungqertua wii.
Now I have nine children.

318
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:48,000
Five-aat angutnguluteng, pingayun arnauluteng.
Five are male, and three are female.

Ukut yuut ayuqsuitut. Una qanrucunaunani-am iliit piyugtuq,

These people are different. One of them tends to be mischievous
and disregards [instruction or wisdom].

320
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,000
Ayuqsuitelliniut au͡gkut ciuliat qanruyuciicetun.
They’re evidently different as our ancestors back then have said.

321
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,000
Aqsamek-gguq ataucimek anellrung’e’rmeng kinguvret ayuqsuitut.
They say that descendants are different even when they shared a womb.

322
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,000
Tuaten qanlartut.
That’s what they say.

Tau͡gaam ayuqsuilengraata una tang arcaqerluku

But even though they are different, compassion is the most important
piece of traditional wisdom.

324
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Waten-llu qanrut’lallruitkut:
They also used to tell us this:

325
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:30,500
“Una wani ilasi inerciigalnguukan, qanrutesciigalnguukan
“If one of your family members is mischievous and disobedient

“Una tang anelgutsi qanrutnarkaqerci elpeci quyurrluci anelgutaini.
“Youpl, his siblings, must gather and admonish him.

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:53,500
“Nunurpek’naku, ik’ikevkenaku, tau͡gaam kenekluku elluarrluku piluku.
“Do not scold or criticize him, but treat him well with love.

And then if you take in a son-in-law, it’s an ancient custom

If you take in a son-in-law, love him more than your own children.

Qaillun pingraan pillagavkenaku, unganaqluten tau͡gaam qanrutaqluku,

No matter what he does, do not react violently to him, but speak to him
and instruct him with tenderhearted love.

My son-in-law is [mischievous] like that,
and he abuses this alcohol

But I have never spoken harshly to him to this day
according to what I was instructed.

Concerning what little instruction I gave [him], I talked about that wisdom
with tenderhearted love for my own son-in-law.

00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:19,000
Taumek mat’um nalliini nengauma taum unisngasciigataanga.
That’s why my son-in-law cannot leave me alone today.

And then, I think I just talked about it first

That I should not join others in criticizing mischievous people.

Qanrucunalrianek tau͡gaam ukvelriit acilallrulliniit.
Instead, they called believers obedient.

These days, they call them [Christian] believers.

Back then, however, our ancestors called them qanrucunalriit

They referred to someone who did not do whatever he wanted
but adhered to his instructions as obedient.

Wangkuta tau͡gken mat’um nalliini ukverumalrianek aterpagingaukut,

These days, however, we are called believers,
call that obedient person [a believer].

They told us to be like that so that we would stand [alive] for a long time

These are evidently instructions saying this,

353
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Qalaruqaarluta qanlartut waten:
After they instructed us, they would say this:

354
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:15,000
“Yuum-gguq tau͡gaam kenkek’ni ayuqucirtutua

“A person instruction whom he loves so that [s]he will live well.”

Tamakut-am Jesus-aam qaneryaramikun nalqikanirai

Jesus further explained those with his words
saying this to his disciples in John 6 verse 63.

John 6 verse 63, Jesus-aaq qanertuq tungaunani,
John 6 verse 63, Jesus explicitly said,

“My words to you are breath and life.”

358
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Avani ciuliamteńi Bible-aartangvailgan qanruyun waniwa:
Here is wisdom from back before our ancestors before there was a Bible:

Elpet nukalpiami alqunaq picurlagmun tekiararesquvet

If you flustered and do not remember the traditional wisdom you heard

362
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:20,500
Eneqallanrilkuvki elpenek picitun, elpenek tuquciiquten.
If you do not remember them, you will die by your own fault.

The wisdom you remember will give you strength and save you from that.

00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Tamaa-i-ngulliniuq anerneruciat unguvauciat-llu makut ayuqucirtuutet.
That is apparently how these instructions are breath and life.

366
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,500

We must adhere to them.

They would also tell us this:

368

“Neplirpiiqnaci. Usviircararanrici.”
“Quit being so noisy. Do not act so mindlessly.”

They would also tell us that when we made too much noise in our homes.

370

Behold the precious young people these days

They even fill a huge plane and bring them to other villages
to make a lot of noise.

372

Waniwa-gguq angqeryarturtelluki.
They say they’re bringing them to play basketball.

373
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Tau͡gken ciuliamteńi alerquutarluni waten:
Yet there was this instruction among our ancestors:

If you bring this growing boy do other villages,
he will be mischievous.

They say that’s what one who was brought to outside villages
when he was growing up has always been like.

378
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,000
Ak’a ellaita ciulirneret tangvallruamegteggu tamana
Because those ancestors have seen that

Ellangyuallrani mikelnguq itertaarutesqevkenaku-llu yugnun nunameggni.
They tell people not to bring a growing child to others’ houses
in their villages.

380
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,000
Wall’u nunanun allanun ayagatesqevkenaku.
Or, they tell people not to bring them to other villages.

381
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,000
Tamaa-i alerquutiit au͡gkut ciuliamta.
That is the instruction of our ancestors back then.

382
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,500
Umyuangcatulimek-gguq yungqerrsukumta tamana aturciqerput.
They say that if we want a mindful child, we will adhere to that.

We would not bring our children whom we love to other’s houses,
and we won’t bring them to other [villages].

384
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,500

They say that some would say this:

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
“Tauna ellatuuq, usvituluni-llu, qanyuluni-llu.”
“That person is sensible, wise, and articulate.”

386
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Tamaa-i-gguq ayagacimanrilnguut tuaten ayuqut ellangyuallermeggni.
They say that’s what people who were not taken to other places
when they were growing are like.

387
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,000
Ava-i makut ciuliamteńi qanruyutet piciulriit.
Those are true pieces of wisdom from our ancestors.

Ellaita tangvallerteng tau͡gaam ayuqucirtuutek’larait

Our ancestors back then teach things, true things, that they have seen.

Tamaa-i.
There you have it.

And then they said that even if we are short on something as we live,
we should never take a person’s things or their traps.

391
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,000
Teglegesqevkenata, cangtairarisqevkenata-llu yuum pianek allam.
They told us not to steal, or to take another person’s catches.

392
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Waten qanerluteng:
They said this:

393
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:46,000
“Tauna imarmiutaq wall’u kaviaq tegukuvgu
“If you take that mink or fox

394
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:55,000
“Aulukestevet Agayutem, Ellam Yuan uptellni elpenun

“Your caretaker, God, the Spirit of the Universe,
will let what was prepared to be yours be taken.

395
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,500
“Tauna tegukuvgu ataucimek teguciiquten
“If you take that, you will take one

“But God will exchange what was supposed to be yours to the
one who owns the trap that you’ve taken.

397
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,000
“Elpet ataucimek pitangqerciquten.
“You will only catch one.

“Pikaqsalten elpenek naivciiqaten taumun yugmun.”
“You will transfer what was to be yours to that person.”

399
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,000

That’s another piece of traditional wisdom.

400
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,500

And then some would also say

401
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,700
Ilait-gguq tegucugpakarluteng iruit-llu qungagartelartut
The legs of some who steal too much get crippled

402
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,500
Wall’u talliit qungagarrluteng.
Or their arms get crippled.

00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:49,400
Imkut-gguq angalkuita tamakutgun caskumegteggun

They say that shamans used to do that with their tools
to the people who did that a long time ago.

404
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:56,800
Iruit qungagartelluki, talliit-llu qungagartelluki nangteqevkarluki.
They crippled their legs, and crippled their arms to make them suffer.

00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Ellaita angalkut pissuutemegteggun quyanrilucimegcetun

Those shamans made them like that with their tools
because they were unhappy with them.

406
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:10,000
Taumek arcaqerluku aarutkellruat yuum pianek tegutesqevkenata.
That’s why they especially warned us against taking a person’s things.

407
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,000
Cavagtat-wa mat’um nalliini.
Behold the people these days.

00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:21,000
Tamana-wa ayuqucirtuutekenrilamteggu wangkuta

Because we do not teach that starting from when they’re growing

409

Angyanek-llu ayakaucinaurtut, yuum-llu levaaranek teglegnaurtut
They run off with boats, and they steal a person’s boat motor

410
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yuum-llu kuvyaanek tamalkumek angyaanek teglegnaurtut.
And they would steal a person’s entire drift net from his boat.

Man’a-wa teglegyaram tegucaram iqua alingnarqucii-llu

They’ve probably become like that because they don’t hear about
the consequences of stealing and how dangerous it is

412
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:51,000
Qalarucuirucamceteng tamakunek tuaten pillerkaitnek.
Because we don’t admonish them against doing that.

413
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,500
Amta-llu ellaita ciuliamta aarutkeqapiggluku.
And yet our ancestors strongly warned against it.

414
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Tau͡gaam-llu waten qanruyuterluteng:
But they also had this traditional wisdom:

Let us try to make every one of our fellow people happy in our lives.

They said to look at these people who have always had things,
and they gather what they need.

Yuut-gguq quyallratgun tuaten ayuqut.
They say that they’re like that through people’s gratitude.

Quyayaraq-gguq una assirtuq.
They say that gratitude is good.

419
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Tua-i-ll’ waten Bible-aani naaqilartua:
And then I read this in the Bible:

Giving is more of a cause for gratitude than receiving.

421
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:43,000
Una akurtuneq cikiutminek quyanaqsaaquq
It’s a cause for gratitude to receive a gift

422
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,500

But the Bible says that giving is more important

423
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Waten qanrami: “Cikiqenglleq quyanarqenruuq akurtunermi.”
Because it says this: “Giving is more of a
cause for gratitude than receiving.”

Taumek ciuliamta una-am cali wangkuta camek avegvingqerqumta

That’s why our ancestors told us to help our fellow people
as a form of love if we have anything to spare.

425
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Tamaa-i-gguq cali yuut quyam ugaani
They say that out a person’s gratitude

426
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,400
Yuum-llu temii pinimek cikilriamek ayuqelartuq.
It’s like a person’s body is given strength.

427
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,300

God probably does that.

428
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:29,000
Tuamta-llu cali kevgiurturatuluta yuusqelluta.
They also told us to serve others in our lives.

They say that.

They say that as we serve, we will become stronger,

Naulluulrianun naulluungraata naulluutiita tamatum agturngaunata.
Even if others are sick during an epidemic, they will not touch us.

433
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Tamaa-i cali tamana kevgiurturyaram akqutii.
That’s is the promise of servitude.

434
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:03,000
Yuk akaarnun caciinani nangengqaarkauluni.
A person will stand [alive] for a long time with any afflictions.

435
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,000
Kevgiurturyaraq-am cali una: yuut quyatuut.
This also concerns servitude: people are thankful.

Wall’u mertaquni wall’u eqiuquni arnassagaq wall’ angukara’urluq

Or, if [s]he gets water or chops wood, an old woman or old man
can be thankful for that.

437
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,400
Quyatiin-gguq tauna yuk qulvaqanirciqaa.
They say that his gratitude will uplift that person.

438
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Tamaa-i qanruyutet tamakut ciuliamteńek.
