Then when they had, as they called it, dried out, they wouldn’t gather them but weave them.

111
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,043
Nutaan-llu taqngamegteki imegluki.
Then when they were done, they rolled them up.

112
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:19,906
Tuaten pitullruit tamakut can’get kelugkait.
That’s what they did with the grass they’d use for stitching.

113
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:35,125
Au͡gkut ava-i wangkuta mat’um nalliini-w’ tua-i umyuaqaqamki tua-i wiinga-llu tamana atullerkaa capeqsagulluku.
When I remember those during our time, I also find it difficult to do it.

114
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:42,363
Tua-i-llu nutaan cali makut angutait
And then their men

115
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:58,007
Makunek cali pissuutekameggnek makunek imarmiutarcuutekameggnek taluyinaurtut.
They would make these tools, fish trap-like traps to catch minks.

116
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:09,514
Mikluki tua-i, qaill’ waten taktaurluki, qaillun-llu tua-i waten kuiggaat-wa tua-i cuqluki taluyitullruut.
They would make fish traps small, about this long, and a certain size after measuring the streams.

117
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:16,758
Tamakut-am cali piciatun pivkenateng cuqerluteng cali.
Those were also not made without a process, but had measurements.

118
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:23,515
Makut-llu cali ilulirait waten can’giircuutetun ayuqevkenateng.
Their inner components would not be like this like a blackfish trap.

119
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:31,028
Waten pinaurtut, tua-i-llu ingna igtetun ayquqeqerluni.
They would be like this, and this over there would be like a den.

120
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:43,778
Au͡gna-wa alqerma uinga tayima waten tangvaurarqamni
When I watched my older sister’s husband like this back then

121
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:56,141
Unatni tua-i waten piqerluki tauna tua-i cuq’errluku iteryararkaa, wagg’uq igyaraa piqa’aqluku.
He would do this with his hands, and measure the entrance, what they call the igyaraq.

122
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,135
Tuaten ayuqetullruut piciatun pivkenateng.
That’s what they were like, not made without a process.

123
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:13,016
Tuamtellu cali cuignilngurcuutnek cali taluyiami tuamtellu igyarait waten ayuqluki au͡g’utun.
Then when he made fish trap-like traps for land otters, he would make the entrances like that.

124
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:23,041
Tua-i-llu waten unatni cuq’errluku uumek kumluminek waten elliurluki neqututacirkiurluki.
Then he would measure with his hand like this, doing this with his thumb to measure their width.

125
00:19:23,585 --> 00:19:32,485
Tuaten piciatun-am cali pivkenateng tamakut pitullrulliniut.
Those would also not be made without a process.

126
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:47,129
Tua-i mat’um nalliini-w’ tua-i umyuaqaqamki au͡gkut qaill’-wa tua-i yuullruciit
These days, when I remember how they used to live back then

127
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:57,405
Piut, umyuaqaqamki caperqetullruanka.
You know, when I remember them, I would feel like they had difficult lives.

128
00:19:57,517 --> 00:20:12,380
Tau͡gaam wiinga-w’ tua-i Kass’angluki pillruama makut maa-i aulukesteput Kass’artaatullruut.
But since I [grew up] when after Westernization, our caretakers lived with some Western things.

129
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:19,592
Tau͡gaam carugarnek unangeksaunateng.
But they didn’t get a lot of [Western] things.

130
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:33,342
Makut maa-i saayut, mukaaq, saarralaq, caqapigtaqameng-llu sugg’alinek cali piaqluteng.
They had these things, tea, floud, sugar, and once in a while, pilot bread.

131
00:20:34,342 --> 00:20:48,992
Tamakut tau͡gken tua-i unakek’ngait tua-i itrutaqaceteng tepsaqnaurtut tua-i cakneq.
However, when they brought in whatever they got, they would smell very strong.

132
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:53,499
Imkut-llu makut mat’um nalliini tepailnguut.
These days, those don’t smell like anything.

133
00:20:53,512 --> 00:21:04,412
Sugg’alit antaqaceteng yaaqsigluteng tepsaqnaurtut, narniqpiarluteng assirluteng.
When they took out pilot bread, they would smell strong from afar, they smelled nice and good.

134
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:11,994
Maa-i mat’um nalliini waten caciirulluki wiinga piunga.
These days, I don’t notice them anymore.

135
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,475
Caqa’arqama tau͡gaam nar’aqluki tua-i canimetaqata.
But once in a while, I smell them when they’re close.

136
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:23,831
Au͡gkut ava-i tuaten ayuqellruut.
That’s what those were like.

137
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:33,156
Qaillun-mi uksuarmi iciw’ waten ayagaqata iciw’ inerquutek’lallrit angutet?
What about the admonishments they had for men, you know, when they traveled in the fall like this?

138
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:39,194
Tua-llu, ii-i, waten ayagaaqameng
So, yes, when they traveled like this

139
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:49,625
Inerquutektullruit waten aarnarqellrani.
They would admonish them when it was dangerous like this.

140
00:21:49,938 --> 00:22:00,026
Neplirasqevkenaki-llu cali yuilqumi pitullruit. Waten neplirasqevkenaki.
They also told them not to make too much noise in the wilderness. They told them not to make too much noise like this.

141
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:13,651
Tau͡gaam imkut arenqiallugtellriit, tamaa-i tamakut kiskuneng tua-i nepliraarkauluteng.
Only those who’ve gotten into accidents, they will make a lot of noise if they fall into water.

142
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:25,414
Inerquutekluki-am cali tamakut waten uksuarmi yuilqumi aarasqevkenata, neplirasqevkenata.
They also admonished us in the fall like this not to scream or make too much noise in the wilderness.

143
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:36,733
Tamakut-gguq tamaa-i tau͡gaam nanikualriit tuaten nepliratullruut.
They said that only those who were helpless would make noise like that.

144
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:49,659
Tua-i-llu neplilriamek aaralriamek niiskuneng tua-i tauna taringerkauluku arenqiallugucia wall’u kis’ucia.
Then if they hear someone making noise or screaming, they would understand that he got into an accident or sunk into water.

145
00:22:51,084 --> 00:23:06,246
Tau͡gken mat’um nalliini tua-i inerquumananriameng-wa tua-i, inerqurnanriamceci wangkuta
These days, however, since they are no longer admonished, since we no longer admonish you

146
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:09,022
Caciirulluteng.
They don’t know how to act anymore.

147
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:19,966
Waten-llu neplianaurtut aaraaqluteng tua-i nunat akuliitni.
They also make a lot of noise and scream between villages.

148
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,948
Inerquutektullruit.
They admonished against that.

149
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:35,136
Tua-i-llu ataucirqumek wiinga atullruaqa tamana arenqiallugtellria niitellemni.
So, I experienced that one time when I heard someone who had gotten into an accident.

150
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:45,155
Ukut, ukut nunauruyuciat Tuntutuliarmiut akaurpailgan
Not long after Tuntutuliak was established as a village

151
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:54,486
Kellirni kanani uitallemteńi, ukut-wa keluqliput cali.
When we were in Kelliq down there, and there were people upriver too.

152
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,280
Una waniwa nanvaq mat’um enem ketiini tangraan.
You see this lake toward the water from this house.

153
00:24:02,462 --> 00:24:12,962
Waten erenrani atakuyartumi maaken kelumteńek aaralria, qang’a-ll’ pingkuuyukanka.
In the day like this toward the evening, someone was screaming inland from us, and I thought it was our inland neighbors.

154
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:18,569
Cunaw’ tua-i kit’ellria kanani, kicaaqellinill’.
It turned out he had fallen into the water down there.

155
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:33,531
Qerruniaranrakun iliita atralriit tanglliniluku man’a waten nunataitellrani.
One of the people going down saw him just as he was about to freeze when there was no village like this.

156
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:41,562
Cat inerquutait au͡gkut amllellruut.
The people back then had a lot of admonishments.

157
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:48,419
Waten au͡g’umek ava-i neplirasqevkenaki pitullruluki.
They would tell them not to make noise like this.

158
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:57,019
Tua-i-llu nutaan waten cali ayakata’arqameng cali
Then, when they were also going to travel like this

159
00:25:00,506 --> 00:25:08,544
Qanerrlainarluteng tamatum nuniinun ayakatarniluteng.
They would always say where they were going to go.

160
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:26,094
Tua-i waten tekitenritaqata-llu tua-i arenqialluguciit nalluvkenaki piaqluki.
When they wouldn’t return like this, they would know that they had gotten into an accident.

161
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:40,300
Tau͡gken mat’um nalliini waten ayagaaqameng maa-i angyatgun qanerpek’nateng.
When they travel with boats these days, however, they don’t say anything.

162
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:51,394
Tua-i-llu tekitenrilameng, tekitenrilata qaill’ tua-i ayuquciinaki qanenrilata.
Then when they don’t return, they don’t know what happened because they didn’t say anything.

163
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:58,419
Piciatun maa-i mat’um nalliini ayagangameng.
It’s because they don’t consider before traveling these days.

164
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:05,901
Wall’u natetmurrnguarluteng nunanun-ll’ allanun ayagaqluteng.
Or they say they’re going somewhere, then go to other villages.

165
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:13,207
Tamaa-i tamatum maa-i mat’um nalliini ayuquciirucetaitkut.
That is what causes us confusion these days.

166
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:24,232
Qaillun tua-i ukut kingunrulriit waten ayuquciinaki piaqluki.
We don’t know what the next generation is doing.

167
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,495
Wall’u tuancukluki.
Or we think they’re somewhere [else].

168
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:38,145
Maa-i mat’um nalliini yuilqumi-llu tua-i tuqungraata qaillun ayuquciitaqluki.
These days, even if they die in the wilderness, we have no idea about them.

169
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:50,995
Tang tua-i mat’um nalliini tua-i-wa waten caknernarqellriit amlleriameng.
You see, it’s because there are not a lot of things that bring us struggle these days.

170
00:26:53,783 --> 00:27:01,883
Maa-i waten au͡gkut ayuqellrunritut waten.
Now, the people back then were not like this.

171
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:07,302
Tua-i ca murilkerrlainarluku.
They always observed everything.

172
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:23,721
Uksuarmi-llu wangkuta cali tan’gaurlurni waten qalaruquratullruitkut ciunerkamteńek, tekitarkamteńek ellmeng atuqemeggnek.
And in the fall, they would always speak to us boys about our future, what we would experience, things they had experienced.

173
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:30,078
Aarnarqellriit apertualuki yuilqumi-llu.
They would explain dangerous things, in the wilderness too.

174
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:47,847
Cat, cat-llu maani nunam qaingani pengurraat qertuuralriit aterluteng, kuiggaat-llu tamarmeng aterluteng, nanvat-ll’ ilait cali aterluteng.
And everyhing on this land, elevated hills, had names, and all of the creeks had names, and some lakes had names.

175
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:55,041
Tua-i nalluvkenaku man’a nunam qainga.
They knew they layout of the land.

176
00:27:55,148 --> 00:28:09,235
Tau͡gken mat’um nalliini makut maa-i yup’ut apertuatnanriimteki mat’umek yuilqumek
These days, however, since we are not pointing things out in the wilderness to our children anymore

177
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:17,198
Cat-llu nallungluki, kuiget-llu, nanvat-llu, qertulriit-llu makut.
They don’t know anything, including these river, and lakes, and these elevated spots.

178
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:32,129
Camek-llu tua-i piaqata apcaaqellriani cam nuniini camek piciitnek
And when they get something and are asked what area they got it from

179
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:41,710
Wall’u yuk tauna waten maa-i mat’um nalliini tamarilalriit, tamalalriit.
Or if they lose where a person is, or a person gets lost as they do these days.

180
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:56,885
Tauna, tauna tangertellra apcaaqellriani cam nuniini tangellrucianek atra-llu nalluluku.
When they ask the person who saw him about the area he saw him, he doesn’t know its name.

181
00:28:56,891 --> 00:29:05,716
Taum-gguq avani-irluteng tau͡gaam pinaurtut apertuatnanriamceteng.
They only say, "Over there," because we don’t point those out to them anymore.

182
00:29:06,885 --> 00:29:14,997
Ca tamalkuan wangkuta qalaruyutek’lallruyaaqaput aturrlainarpek’naki tau͡gaam.
We used to talk about everything, but we wouldn’t always use them.

183
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:19,685
Tau͡gaam tekitaqamteki elitaqaqluki.
But when we came upon them, we would recognize them.

184
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:30,192
Yaa, qanruyutekun tau͡gaam yuk yuugarkauyaaqelliniami.
Yes, a person must only live according to the traditional wisdom.

185
00:29:30,342 --> 00:29:42,867
Qanruyun atunrilkuniu elluarrluni yuungaitelliniuq, ilaminek-llu waten enuqlilluni calrianek.
If he does not abide by traditional wisdom, he will not live right, and he will have need of the things his peers work for.

186
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:58,348
Waten au͡gkut qalarutetullruitkut: man’a-gguq qanruyun atuqumteggu maligtaquluku-llu yuukumta elluarrluta yuugarkaugukut
They would talk to us like this back then: if we live using and abiding by this traditional wisdom, we will live well

187
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,642
Qessalertevkenata, qavaarpek’nata.
Not being lazy, not sleeping too much.

188
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:10,179
Tuaten tua-i akeqnauraitkut.
They would promise us that.

189
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:22,617
Tau͡gken tua-i tamana apertuallrat tekiteksaunaku.
However, we didn’t come upon the time they pointed out.

190
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:28,099
Tau͡gaam tekitaqamteggu maa-i mat’um nalliini elitaqaqluku.
But when we come upon them these days, we recognize it.

191
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:34,024
Taumek au͡gkut waten qalarut’lallrukaitkut:
That’s why they would talk to us like this back then:

192
00:30:35,211 --> 00:30:46,324
Una-gguq qalarutestevut murilkelluku tangvaurqilarput qanra.
We should pay attention to someone who is talking to us and watch his mouth.

193
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:55,561
Atam-gguq uluqaqumteggu imna qalartellra uunguciirniartuq.
They said that if we look away from him, we’ll have no idea what he’s talking about anymore.

194
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:57,442
Ilumun-llu...
And indeed...
