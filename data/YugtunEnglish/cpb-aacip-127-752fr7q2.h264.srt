Wall’u-qaa tua-i pissurnanriimceteng piut?
Or is it because we don’t hunt them anymore?

313
00:48:17,438 --> 00:48:27,194
Uitainanemni maaten imna qimugteka piaqa ak’a amiik au͡gna iriatengllinikii tua-i, aren camek pingatqapiggluni.
As I sat there, I found my dog was already rocking back and forth in the door, oh my, as if sensing something.

314
00:48:27,213 --> 00:48:33,684
Umyuartequa, "Qayumi, tua-i piqataaraanga waniw’ tua-i."
I thought, "As expected, it’s going to get me now."

315
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:43,962
Aren tua-i uitalua. Uitainanemni atam iternerngalngurmun qaterrluni itraaralria.
Oh my, I stayed still. As I stayed still, you see, something that looked like white steam slowly came in.

316
00:48:43,983 --> 00:48:48,240
Qaillun-llu pitaqerluni tayim’ amuluni anluni.
Then at some point, it retracted and went out.

317
00:48:48,255 --> 00:48:53,155
Umyuarteqa’artua, "Uumiku pikanirluni piciquq."
A thought came to mind, "It’ll come closer next time."

318
00:48:53,160 --> 00:49:02,860
Qimugteka-ll’ una maani tarrangarrluni. Tua-i nallunauani wangtun alingluni. Alingluni tua-i.
And my dog started pacing here. It was clear it was afraid like me. It was afraid.

319
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:12,039
Uumikuan’ piqerlua piunga nutaan arcarikanirluni, qengagmiaraluni tuaten, qilugyarpiaraqluni.
Then next time, it got worse, even waving its nose around, and almost barking.

320
00:49:12,054 --> 00:49:17,081
Pinga’arteqerluni atam iterneq man’a itralria.
Eventually, you see, this steam starting coming in.

321
00:49:17,096 --> 00:49:27,154
Ak’akirraq tua-i qukaqerluku nutaan atam nucuan, qimugteka imna tunumnun pamavet tagluni.
When it finally retracted after reaching the middle, my dog went behind me.

322
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:34,438
Pama-i qemirrlumni sugg’egni pulallukek pamavet uitaqertuq.
Behind me, it put its snout on my spine and stayed.

323
00:49:34,446 --> 00:49:41,360
Tamana iterneq uatmurquraan, tamana tua-i anngan
When that steam went toward the door, when it went out

324
00:49:41,372 --> 00:49:47,386
Qimugteḿa tang pam’um sugg’egminek cinguuqiliu tunuka.
My dog behind me started pushing my back with its snout.

325
00:49:47,403 --> 00:49:53,260
Umyuarteqa’artua, "Uum tang anesqessugnarqekiinga."
A thought came to mind, "This [dog] probably wants me to go out."

326
00:49:53,274 --> 00:50:03,402
Aren uitangnaqa’arcaaqvimnek inarrvicualleraak atkucualle’rqa-ll’ as’arrluku
Oh my, after I tried to stay, I [rolled up] my bedding, and put on my parka

327
00:50:03,421 --> 00:50:11,121
Taukuk tua-i inarrvicualler imkarluku, nemkarluku, nacaqerlua-llu anlua.
I rolled up and bound my bedding, put on my hat, and went out.

328
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:20,448
Uavet una iteryaraq uaqliq lumarrallermek agalriartangqertuq.
There was a piece of cloth hanging here on the outer entrance.

329
00:50:20,468 --> 00:50:24,482
Qakmavet tau͡gken anyaraq amiipiuluni.
But the exit to outside was a real door.

330
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:35,132
Tauna tua-i waniw’ anqataama, nacaqaama kenurrak taukuk cupqaqenka tua-i uivetmun. Nipluki tua-i.
When I was going to go out, when I put on my hand, I blew on those lamps in an arc. I turned them off.

331
00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:46,427
Aren tua-i amik cuqluku anelrarlua, tauna tekicamku lumarralleq, qakugcamun imumun puukarlii alikek’ngamnun.
Oh my, when I went out measuring the door, when I reached that cloth, I bumped into that [?qakugcaq] that I was afraid of.

332
00:50:47,213 --> 00:50:52,885
Aren pivailemku ankilii ellamun.
Oh my, before I [hit] it, I went outside.

333
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:58,686
Anngama ellamun ukalirnetmun, iqlutun-llu tang pillruyaaqelliniunga
When I went out, I went this way, and I think I went the wrong way

334
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:05,717
Akertem ayagyaraa maliggluku uivesqelarngatellruitki.
Because I think they said to go around it following the way the sun goes.

335
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:11,421
Kiarteksaunii-ll’ tua-i, kiingan tau͡gaam acika paallallerkaqa tau͡gaam.
And I didn’t look around, only for what I would trip over below me.

336
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:15,735
Kassuamku tua-i avateka-ll’ man’a tangeqsaunaku.
When I went around it, I didn’t look around me.

337
00:51:15,754 --> 00:51:20,712
Qimugta tauna tua-i sagtanka pingayurraungata qimugtenka.
I spread out my dogs because I only had three dogs.

338
00:51:20,717 --> 00:51:28,317
Saagarcamki ciulisteka im’ taikili tuavet tua-i ciulistem eksraanun.
When I spread them out, my lead dog came to the lead dog’s spot.

339
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:38,919
Qamiqurra tang uskuragnek ac’amku ellminek tang una picetaarpek’nani imkuk ukuk askilikek elavluni-llu.
When I put the harness on it, it put them on by itself without being told to, and crouched.

340
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:47,886
Tuamtell’ taukuk tua-i uskurarraarlukek tua-i kiarteksauna[ni], una tau͡gaam tua-i tangvallra kiingan tangvagluku.
Then after I harnessed it, it didn’t look around except what it was watching [in front of it].

341
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:52,850
Aren imkut tua-i qaqicamki hait-aartut.
Oh my, when I finished them, I went hait.

342
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:57,034
Tuar tang snuukuuq ayaga’rtua [?].
It seemed like a snowgo when I went.

343
00:51:57,034 --> 00:52:04,048

Oh my, I was so scared that [?] would take me from behind.

344
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:09,104
Tua-i tang qimugtemnek taumek irr’illruunga.
You see, I was amazed by my dog.

345
00:52:09,116 --> 00:52:16,673
Ikayuqapiarallrukiinga tuani tua-i. Anesqellua tua-i nallunailngurmek cinguurlua.
It helped me a lot at that time. It pushed me, clearly wanting me to go out.

346
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:54,759
Amllerrssaaqut ayuqucirtuuteput, ayuqucirtuutek’lalput wangkuta-w’ tua-i ayagyuani apa’urlungqellriani apa’urlumta qanruyutek’lallriit.
There are many instructions, instructions for us young people, the traditional wisdom of our grandfathers for those of us who have grandfathers.

347
00:52:54,774 --> 00:53:00,403
Cali tuamtellu nunat elatiitnun elliqumta
Also, when we reached the areas right outside of villages

348
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:08,570
Uksuarmi waten pitullruanga: nunat-gguq elatiitnun elliquma, qertulriamek tangerquma
He would tell me this in the fall: if I reach the area right outside of a village and see an elevated hill

349
00:53:08,573 --> 00:53:15,873
Ullagluku qainganun mayurlua avateka kiareskilaku, nunat avatiit kiareskilaku
I should go to it, climb it, and look around me, look around the village

350
00:53:15,898 --> 00:53:19,512
Nallunairturluki ukut nunat.
Making mental maps of these villages.

351
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:31,633
Una tua-i qertulria, makut-llu qertuuralriit, nanvat-llu makut qertuuralriarit ceńaitni murilkelluki cakneq.
I should pay very close attention to this elevated hill, these elevated hills, and the lakes around these elevated hills.

352
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:38,118
Tamaa-i-gguq anirtuutekaqanka ella assiiruskan nalluyagutailkuma.
He said those will save me when the weather turns bad if I’m not forgetful

353
00:53:38,136 --> 00:53:42,893
Tau͡gaam tua-i wiinga atuqsaitellruanka tamakut.
But I didn’t practice those.

354
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:51,282
Nalluyaguqurluki-w’ tua-i pilallruama imumi, iliini tau͡gaam tua-i nallunritaqluki.
I used to forget them all the time back then, but I would sometimes know them.

355

Tuamtellu pinauraanga, "Cacetulria-gguq arenqiallugtellerkaminun tau͡gaam tekitaatuuq"
Then he would tell me, "An overconfident person only comes to misfortune"

356
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,771
Apqiitnek cacetulria.
As they say, an overconfident person.

357
00:54:05,082 --> 00:54:15,368
Tau͡gken-gguq imna caceskilnguq tua-i arenqiallugpakayuunani.
They said, however, that a timid person doesn’t come to misfortune too much.

358
00:54:15,548 --> 00:54:22,405
Ilumun tua-i tamana wiinga atullruaqa.
Indeed, I experienced that.

359
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:28,667
Alingtaama tua-i waniw’ arenqiallugpailegma waten ellirtua.
Because I’m easily scared, I’ve reached this age before coming to misfortune.

360
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:42,902
Ataucirquqapiarmek tau͡gaam waten uksumi mat’um maa-i nalliini ugna-llu Alba-llu maavirqaarlunuk utertellmegni
But only one time in the winter like this recently, when Alba downriver and I went home after coming here

361
00:54:42,926 --> 00:54:50,553
Qavartarvigmi uaken Kuigilngurmiut canimellekluki qavartaucugyaaqekiinga.
At Qavartarvik downriver, he wanted to camp with me near Kwigillingok.

362
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:56,059
Piaqa wii atrarciqnilua, nunat canimetniluki.
I told him that I’d go down, that the village was close.

363
00:54:56,290 --> 00:55:07,361
Tua-i nunat waniw’ tekiteqerluki uunguciircama, au͡gna-llu malika arulairlunuk piaqa
When I got lost as we reached the lands, my companion and I stopped, and I said to him

364
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:13,371
"Ayagiinarpek’nanuk arulairnaurtukuk, piircian-llu-w’ qakemna ella."
"Let’s not continue, but stop, because there’s a blizzard out there."

365
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:19,475
Cunaw’ wavet nunat keluaraatnun arulaillinilriakuk.
It turned out that we stopped a short ways inland from the village.

366
00:55:19,499 --> 00:55:28,214
Unuakumi maaten tanqigiaraan qinertua, elitnaurvik una ciuqamegni.
When I looked out in the mornign as it was getting bright, I found that the school was in front of us.

367
00:55:30,598 --> 00:55:41,326
Au͡gkut ava-i quyanarqut au͡g’um ciuqlirma uum qanrutkurallri. Tua-i amllernek ilasciigatanka.
I am thankful for what the one before me just said. I can’t add too much to them.

368
00:56:02,914 --> 00:56:08,114
Tau͡gaam cali alerquutetangqertuq qanrutkenritellrit makut.
But there’s also an instruction that these didn’t speak about.

369
00:56:08,374 --> 00:56:17,560
Alerquutetangqertuq cali: elpenek anangnaqsugngauten, elpenek-llu anagyugngauten tan’gaurlurni.
There’s another instruction: you can try to save yourself, and you boys can save yourselves.

370
00:56:17,844 --> 00:56:23,744
Nani yuilqumi uitang’e’rpet, nenglem nalliini ping’e’rpet
No matter where you are in the wilderness, even if it’s during the cold season

371
00:56:23,765 --> 00:56:32,665
Elpet teq’urpenek, nakmiin teq’urpenek elpenek urumaarkauguten.
You must keep yourself warm by your urine, your own urine.

372
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,065
Wiinga call’ atulqaqa tamana.
I’ve also done that.

373
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:44,068
Ernerpak, erenrem taktaciatun camek nereksaunii, qaika-llu mecungengan
All day, since I hadn’t eaten for the whole day, and since my body was wet

374
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:51,383
Ayainanemni saskamun qurrlua saskangqerrama, egmian mer’aqluku.
As I went, I would urinate into a cup since I had a cup, and would drink it right away.

375
00:56:51,386 --> 00:56:57,014
Urumaunga kiituan nunamnun tekitua kinguneqa nallunrilamku.
I kept warm and eventually reached my village, since I knew where my home was.

376
00:56:57,019 --> 00:57:04,891
Erneq waten taklirillran nalliini tau͡gaam nengllirluni unguvallerkamnun tua-i tekillua.
During the time when the days were long but cold, I made it alive.

377

Then another instruction if you reach someone who’s come to misfortune in the wilderness, without food and cold

378

Cali waniwa ciuqliuluku: teq’urranek wall’u elpet teq’urpenek ikayuyugngaan tauna qerruskii urumallerkaanun.
This is also the first thing: you can help that cold person with his urine or your urine to warm him up.

379
00:57:28,937 --> 00:57:33,052
Cali-llu arcaqerluku puqlamun pivekanki.
And most importantly, don’t put him in heat.

380
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:43,303
Puqlamun cali pikuvgu, maa-i nallunrituci, arnani-llu nallunrituci, wangkuta-ll’ angutngungramta tanglaraput
If you put him in heat, you know, and you women know, and we men see it

381
00:57:43,538 --> 00:57:49,652
Puqlam caniani uitaaqami kumlii ilutmun ayatuuq.
When he’s by a heat source, the cold goes inward.

Though his outside looks warm, the cold inside goes in. It gets stronger inward.

383
00:57:59,995 --> 00:58:02,067
Tamatutangqertuq.
There are those cases.

384
00:58:02,204 --> 00:58:15,462
Makut maa-i ava-i, tua-i-w’ ilaitnun neryuniuqsaaqanka qanruteknayukluki au͡gkut ikayuqenqallerkarput.
These things just now, I was hoping some would talk about them so that we could help someone

385
00:58:15,483 --> 00:58:23,655
Pitsaqevkenata waten kumlam nangeskiinek tekiskumta tau͡gaam unguvaluni.
Should happen across someone that the cold is killing, but [still] alive.

386
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:32,174
Tamaa-i call’ ava-i ciuqliuluku neqmek pivailemteggu ciuqliuluku ikayuutekarput.
That’s the first thing before giving him food, the first way we can help.

387
00:58:32,193 --> 00:58:43,479

Our urine that they point out, what we have always done, and we can help ourselves if we are [freezing] like that.

Quyana.
Thank you.
