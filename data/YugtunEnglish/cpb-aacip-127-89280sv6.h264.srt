We get them when we’d gather and subsist.

00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,490
Pingnaqenrilnguq-llu caunani, arrsauluni, neqkaunani-llu.
And one who doesn’t subsist has nothing, is poor, and has no food.

Because there was no welfare back then.

So that [s]he can give those to them.

Some mornings, my mother would tell me back when I was young when I got up

"Go and check on them, and the women with no providers."

They can’t prepare for guests anymore. Though young people are able, they can’t do them on their own anymore.

And without payment, they can’t do it without a little payment.

You see, these days, you know how you say that people have changed?

84
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,540

We know how they’ve changed.

85
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,080
Tungelquqelriit, tungayakelriit tungayakutenrirtut.
Families, close relatives do not act like relatives anymore.

It’s because people’s treating each other with love has changed now.

Tua-llu aptaqama tamaani kinguani, "Qaillun taukut enem iluanelnguut yuullruat?"
Then when I asked after that time, "How did those in the home live?"

90
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,570
Taum aanama qanrutaqlua waten:
My mother would tell me this:

91
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,920
Yuut-gguq taukut yuullruut
Those people lived

92
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:19,260
Una piutengqerpek’nani, una-llu neqautminek qanyuunani, nangqatalrianek nangelrianek-llu qanyuunani.
This didn’t claim anything, and this didn’t speak of their food, and they didn’t say they’re low or gone.

93
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,780
Ilakuyutqapiarluteng ilakuyutellriit ataucimek enerluteng.
Very tight-knit relatives had one house.

And they never refused them anything. Even if it was their only one, they’d have them use it without payment.

97
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:53,060
Maa-i tang mat’um nalliini ca tamarmi carraquinrayagaq
You see, these days, every little thing

98
00:11:53,515 --> 00:12:02,055
Akiyuutngurtellria ikayuutekaq, cikiutekaq.
What was to be for help, to be given, has turned profitable.

99
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,620
Cali alerquutengqerrluta wangkuta.
We also had a traditional instruction.

100

Though we’re women, just women, and can’t buy anything

101
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:19,880
Ikayuqengyugnganiluta yugnek.
That we can help people out.

102

Umyuartequa tuani waten mat’umek niitellemni: "Wii-kiq ca aturluku ikayuqengniarcia?"
I thought like this back when I heard this: "I wonder what I can use to help out?"

103
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:30,945
Taum waten aanama pianga:
My mother said this to me:

104
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:39,530
"Camek qanruskuvgu nanikualria, assilriamek qanruskuvgu ikayurciqan."
"If you say something to a depressed person, if you say something good, you will help them."

105
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,650
Tua-llu waten pianga cali:
Then she also said this to me:

106
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:49,390
"Qainga allgulria, allganlilria mingqestailnguq
"His tattered clothes with many holes without anyone to sew it

107
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:57,010
"Natii imna allganruarii-llu nunguareskuvgu tauna ikayurarkaugan."
"If you sew the tears closed, you shall help him."

Tamaa-i ikayuutekelput au͡gkunek avani tua-i yuullemteńi wangkuta akimek ikayuutekaunata.
Those were how we helped others back in our lives without money to help others.

109
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:10,495
Ikayuutektullruaput tua-i
That’s how we helped

110
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:18,265
Atulallruamku-llu wii man’a nunguarcilalqa makunek.
And because I used to practice mending these clothes.

111
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:23,655
Atam cali elitengqertuq kia imum ayagniquniu man’a.
You see, it also becomes a habit if anyone starts this.

112
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:31,410
Maani-llu allgulriamek tangerquni, tua-i-ll’ umyuaqerrluku, "Waniwa-tuq una kitugglaku."
And if they see something torn here, they’ll remember it, "Let me fix this now."

113
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,690
Tuaten elitnarquq. Ca tamarmi elitengqertuq.
One can learn like that. Anything can become a habit.

114
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:41,250
Tamana tuaten atullemni elitellruaqa.
When I practiced that, it became my habit.

115
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:48,290
Tua-i Kassaungraata-llu makuungraata tangrraqamki piyugyaaqnaunka.
Even if they’re these Caucasians, when I see them, I want to [mend] them.

116
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:53,165
Nungucugyaaqluku-llu tauna allganeq umyuarteqaqlua.
And I would think that I want to mend that tear closed.

117
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:57,555
Tua-i-wa ca tamarmi elitengqerrami.
It’s because anything can become a habit.

118
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:03,015
Ikayuqengyaraq, yuum ikayuutekaa amllertuq.
In helping out, there are many ways to help a person.

119
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:24,685
Amlleq ikayurtaagutlerkaq neqkatgun ava-i tua-i ilii taringekvut
We’ve understood part of the many ways to help others through food

120
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:32,955
Avani ikuyrtaagutetullruamta wangkuta nallemteńi cikirtaagulluta.
Because we helped each other back in our time by giving to each other.

121
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:43,110
Neqkamek-llu up’nerkami enuqliterpalaameng ilait unangyuilnguut, neqsuyuilnguut, pisciigalnguut
And since some who do not catch anything, fish, or are unable have great shortages of food in the spring

122
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:52,540
Tamaaggun tua-i kanaulaamteki maavet neq’ngellerkaanun.
Since through that, we carry them through food scarcity until food comes.

123
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:03,490
Tau͡gaam una waniw’ nugtarrvikluku piqataraput: atunem ikayurtaagutlerkaq.
But we’re going to move on to this: helping each other.

124
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:12,490
Atunem ikayurtaagutlerkaq pillgutekluni.
Helping each other as a community.

125
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:22,885
Camek wangkuta ikayurtaagulluta, wall’ nunalegni cat ilaitni atutuarput tamana.
Helping each other with something, or sometimes, we practice that in villages.

126
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:31,645
Camek ilavut tua-i carpagmek iliini caliangqelartuq
Sometimes, one of us has a some big job to do

127
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:35,895
Wall’u enelingnaqluni-llu
Or trying to build a house

128
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:44,135
Wall’u muragnek tamaani enengqetuameng, tuskanek piyuitellruameng tamatum nalliini
Or because they had wooden homes back then, since they didn’t have wooden boards at that time

129
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:49,175
Makunek plywood-aat-llu cataitellruameng tamatum nalliini.
Also because there were none of this plywood back then.

130
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:58,065
Tau͡gaam muragnek enekarrluteng yuut maani Kusquqvagmi pitullruameng
But since people would get wood for houses from here on the Kuskokwim

131
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:03,165
Tamakunek atussiyaanringameng.
Since they don’t use those much anymore.

132
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:09,995
Cali nallemni atuqaqulang’e’rmegteki mudhouse-at au͡gkut apqait
Also, though they regularly used what they called mudhouses in my time

133
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:18,105
Tamatum nalliini atutullruamegteki up’nerkillerni-llu, kiillerni, uksuillerni-llu
Since they used those at that time in spring camps, fish camps, and winter camps

134
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:21,120
Tua-i tamakut atuumamallrukait.
Thye used those for a long time.

135
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:31,630
Tau͡gaam nunani waten ukut nunarraat camek caliaqata ikayungcarilartut caperqelaamegteki
But in small villages like this, they ask for help when they work on something because they find them difficult

136
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:39,940
Muriit-llu makut uqiggetenrilameng, canek-llu cayugcuutnek piitellruamta tamatum nalliini
And since wood is not light, and we had no machines to pull them back then

137
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:45,300
Tau͡gaam tua-i unatetgun tegularluki pitullruameng.
But, because they took them by hand.

138
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:53,380
Cali tua-i qanruyutelaameng
Also, since they spoke to each other

139
00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:03,070
Elpengevkalaitkut, ilateng elpengevkarluki uumek ikayurnarqellriamek piaqameng.
They notify us, they notify those around them when they work on this that needs help.

140
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:13,990
Tua-i-llu nutaan imkut yuut taukuni nunarrarni uitalriit kitakiilaraitkut
Then the people of that village prod us

141
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:23,130
Camek pirpanrilngurmek ikayuutarkaunrilengramta ullautesqelluta.
That even if it’s not big and we won’t have to help, to go to them.

142
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:31,330
Tua-i ellait taqneret ellaita calillgutekluteng piaqata
When those adults worked together

143
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,940
Camek ellimeraqatkut wangkuta tua-i ca im’ pirpanrilnguq aqvaaqluku.
When they ordered us, we’d get something though it wasn’t important.

144
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:44,100
Calissuun-llu ca-llu imna ellimerutekaqatgu aqvaaqluku tua-i wangkuta.
And when they asked for a tool or something, we’d get it.

145
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:52,620
Tua-i tallikelriacetun tamakut taqneret makut camek caliaqameng.
We were like the arms for these adults when they worked on something.

146
00:17:52,620 --> 00:18:04,680
Enemek-llu eneliqatarqameng tagutelaamegteki piavet tua-i caliaqvigkaan nuniinun maaken mermek tagulluku.
And when they were going to make houses, since they brought them inland to where it’s going to be worked on, they’d bring them up from the water here.

147
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:12,985
Wall’u cali imumi-am
Or also, a long time ago

148
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,280
Nunalget ukut mat’umek-am ikayungcaritullrulriit.
These villages would ask for help with this.

149
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:29,180
Qasgimek-ll’ uumek caliqata’arqameng qasgim caliaqsaraa angengami
And when they were going to build a community house, since making a community house is a big job

150
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,430
Muragpall’e’rnek-llu piyaraullruami canirtarnek.
And since it needed huge logs of wood.

151
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:39,560
Nunalget kelegluki invite-arluki pitullruit.
They’d invite, kelegluki, villages.

152
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:49,200
Ellaita ukut yuut yugkarteng ikgellekluki piaqamegteki nunalget kelelarait, invite-arluki nunameggnun.
When they thought their people would be to few, they’d invite villages to their own.

153
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:57,505
Aperluku qasgimek caliqatarniluteng, ikayuusqelluteng.
They say that they were going to work on a community house, and asked for help.

154
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:07,610
Tua-i-ll’ taukut nunalget invite-allrit nunanek tua-i tekilluteng tua-i, nutaan tua-i tekilluteng taum kelgumiimeng.
Then those villages that they invited would arrive, they would arrive there since they were invited.

155
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,210
Ak’a tua-i muriit tau͡gaam upingaluteng tua-i kana-i pikait.
But the wood they were going to use was already ready down there.

156
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:24,915
Nutaan tua-i qavcin nunat, malruin-llu kelellrit tua-i calillgutekluteng caliluteng ikayuqluteng.
Then several villages, even two they invited, would work together and help each other.

157
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:32,505
Tauna enerpall’er qasgiq caliaqluku ikayuqluteng.
They’d help each other work on that huge sod house, the community house.

158
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:37,815
Marayamek-llu patulaamegteki tamaani qasgit
And since they covered community houses with sod back then

159
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:48,750
Makunek tua-i canegnek-llu kanevyailkucirraarluki nutaan marayamek patulaamegteki
And since they covered them in sod after they spread grass to prevent crumbling down

160
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,930
Muriit tamakut canirtaarteng taqumariaqata.
When they finished setting the logs on their sides.

They would work on it like that until it was finished.

When they were finished, this host village would hold what we call today a potluck for the villages they invited.

Tua-i tamatum nalliini nutaan tua-i nerevkarluki kassiyucuarluteng tauna imna taqngan qasgiq.
Back then, they’d hold a feast like a small dance festival when that community house was finished.

164
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:35,780
Aren nutaan tua-i yurarluteng tuaten tamatumek tua-i nutaan akililriacetun piluki.
Oh my, they would even Yup’ik dance like a reward for that to them.

They had them enjoy themselves.

And after they had a feast, when that was finished

167
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:48,275
Tamatumek nangnirluku nerevkaritmek.
They would end with that feast.

168
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:54,585
Tua-i potluck-aarluteng, nutaan angnirluteng tua-i, yurarluteng tuaten.
They had a potluck, and were very happy, even Yup’ik dancing.

They cooperated with them, helping each other out.

And like that with what one person was going to make, because they helped each other

171

Tuaten tauna ca imna piqataqiit yuum ataucim pia tauna ikayurluku.
With what they were going to do, they helped with that one person’s project.

172
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:28,575
Ellimaaluta tuaten wangkuta ikayuulluta tuaten ellaitni nayurluki pisqelluki.
They’d even tell us to help out and stay among them.

173
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:39,125

With their ways of helping, when this village brought up something that they wanted to do

175
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:59,765
Qanlartut imumi kanani nunangqellemteńi unani
They said long ago when there were settlements down there

176
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:03,735
Nunat-ll’ amllenrilameng
And since there weren’t many villages

177
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:14,145
Ukut Moravian mission-aat ayagniqarraallrata kinguani nutaan-am yuut ikayuqluteng.
After the Moravion missions first started, the people really worked together.

Ukut wani mission-aat tuskalingarrluteng.
These missions got a lot of wooden board [houses].

So, we made boardwalks going from the mission to what they called that big store upriver.

180
00:22:30,155 --> 00:22:34,605
Yuut imkut akingellerkameggnek pivkena[teng].
People back then didn’t do it to get payment.

Our caretakers back then, you see, were not like how they are now.

193

We didn’t see many Caucasians, and we didn’t see any money.

Akimek tangerrnaciarumallruunga wiinga ak’anun.
I didn’t first see money for a long time.

Also, I do not forget how my mother took care of me.

I clearly remember it.

198
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,010
Waten aulukellruanga aanama:
This is how my mother took care of me:

I’m going to tell you what I’m like.

Neither do I fill it before dinner.

It’s used to me not nibbling at random times.

You see, the ancestors long ago were not like this.

208
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,610
Cailkakun neramliurayuitut neryarat akulaitni.
They don’t nibble at random between meals.

209
00:26:01,615 --> 00:26:04,370
Neryarat ukuullruameng pingayun:
Becuase there were three meals:

210
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,430
Unuakumi yuurqerluteng.
They drank something hot in the morning.

211

Tua-i-ll’ wani nutaan apiatani erenrem qukaani nerluteng neqpigmek.
Then during lunch at noon they would eat real food.

00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,250
Tua-i nerluta tua-i cunaw’ aqsiluta tua-i tuani.
We would eat and be full then.

00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:24,910
Aqsitnguksaitelaryaaqut-llu cikiuteput aanamteńek. Cangimirrnaq’laryaaqellruut.
What we were given from our mothers wouldn’t be enough to fill. We’d want more.

214
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,690
Wani-llu atakumi tua-i atakutarluta.
And here in the evening, we’d have dinner.

Then after, we wouldn’t ingest anything else until the morning.

Unugmi-llu elisngaluni iluvut meqsuyuunata unugmi.
And at night, our stomachs were used to it, and we wouldn’t be thirsty at night.

217
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,290
Unuakumi tau͡gaam tua-i uitaqatamta carrarmek tua-i.
Only when we awoke in the morning would we have a little something.
