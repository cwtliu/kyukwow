00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,780
Maa-i makut umyuaqelararkaput.
These are things we must remember.

115
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:41,480
Waten-llu yuut assiilkurluki-llu piksaunki.
Also, do not treat people badly.

116
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,970
Ayuqenritut, umyugait-llu ayuqenritut tuaten tautun muragtun.
They’re different, and their minds are different like that piece of wood.

117
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,040
Muragcetun wangkuta ayuqelliniukut yugni.
Apparently, we people are like wood.

Wiinga-llu tuaten qanrucimalallruunga.
I was also told that.

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:04,530
Qiperrlugluama tua-i ikiungama qanruyutnek niitelallruunga.
Since I was pitifully twisted and bad, I would hear traditional wisdom.

Tua-i-ll’ tuaten, tuaten-llam qanrutaqatnga-llu
Then when they would tell me that

00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:15,860
Ap’artelalrianga-llu iliini, "Ciin? Ciin tuaten ayuqluni?"
I would sometimes ask, "Why? Why is one like that?"

122
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,940
Tua-i-gguq yuk tuaten ayuquq.
They said a person is like that.

123
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,930
Qaskukegcilria-gguq tuaten straight-arnganani, ilua qipluni.
They said one with a good appearance looking straight, has twisted insides.

124
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,290
Tamalkurmeng tuaten
All of them like that

125
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:40,580
Assiitellriit, assilriit-llu tuaten tua-i elatait qipngalnge’rmeng, ilukegciluteng umyuaqegciluteng pitulliniluteng.
The ones [who look] good, and the ones who look bad though their appearances look twisted, have good insides when they have good minds.

126
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,310
Tamaa-i tamakut umyuaqnarqelaryaaqaput makut.
Those are the things we must remember.

Also

128
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:59,400
Yuum piqangraakut kiularavkenaki.
Though a person does anything to us, we shouldn’t retort.

129
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:07,220
Anagyaaqeksaunata-llu, assiryukeksaunata-llu.
And we shouldn’t defend ourselves, and not think that we’re good people.

130
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:14,450
Maani-llu tarrartellemteńi ilamteńi-llu assinruyukluta piqaqsaunata
And as we walk here, we should never think we’re better than those around us

And do not stop interacting with people because of our faults.

134
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,340
Ilaliuqcaarluki tau͡gaam yuut yuunaqliniluta.
Evidently, we must live socializing with other people.

135
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:51,790
Tuamtell’ cali waten call’ qanrucimalallruukuk:
Then we would also be told this:

00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:58,000
Atam-gguq an’aqamegnuk
They said that when we go out

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:04,010
Egmianun-gguq ankumegnuk ellam qukaa tangerqilauk.
They said that right when we go out, we should look in the middle of the [Spirit of the] Universe.

They said that the Spirit of the Universe is grateful by nature.

They said to always check the weather, always look around, including at the navigation stars.

140
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,640
Tuamtell’ call’ akerta sass’aqellruluku yuut.
Then people also used the sun to measure time.

141
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:33,510
Tamaa-i-llu wani sass’anek makunek wani atulangllemni
And back when I started using these clocks

142
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,910
Aataka atam sass’anek piyuitellruuq, akertekun tau͡gaam.
My father, you see, never used clocks, only the sun.

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:45,840
Tua-i wani ellamek-ll’ itraarluni, anrraarluni itraqami qanlallruuq
Then after coming in from outside, after he went out and came in, he would say

144
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,220
"Erneq-gguq qukartuq. Nernariuq-gguq."
"It’s noon. It’s time to eat."

Then sometimes, when the sun appeared in the windows, he would say, "It’s one o’clock."

147
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,360
Maaten cali sass’aqa tangerrnaurqa one kela’agluni.
I would look at my clock and find it would be one o’clock.

148
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,610
Tua-i cali sassauyugngalliniluni pekqurallrakun maaggun tangvagluku.
It can also be used to measure time by watching how it moves.

149
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:26,760
Ellaitni nallunaunani, wangkutni nallunaqluni tamana.
That is clear to them, and confusing for us.

150
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:38,780
Nallunaqngalengraata murilkellriit tamakut tuaten pitulliniut.
Though thye seem confusing, those who are observant do that.

I remember how I was told this

153
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,440

About what a person should do.

154
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,410
Tuamtell’ cali qanrut’lallrulua
Then they also used to tell me

155
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:07,110
Makut-wa kasngunarqengraata, takarnarqengraata qanrutkumaarkaulriit.
Though these are shameful and embarrassing, they must be told.

156
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,840
Atam qanrutkumaarkaullinilriit.
You see, they must be told.

Tuamtell’ cali kasngunaqpiangraata qalarutetulliniluku.
Then they would also speak to them though they were very shameful [topics].

158

After I struggled too much, I apologize, I sometimes forget what I’m going to say.

162
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,120
Tau͡gaam-llu waten umyuaminek-llu ping’e’rmi
But also, though one struggles with mental health

163
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,730
Yuut waten yuut umyuaminek ping’e’rmi
Though people struggle with mental health

We must remember them.

When I struggled a lot, since they were all my relatives who passed away last winter over the course of one week.

167
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,650
Tau͡gaam kitak’ umyuarteq’lalta
But let us have this mindset

168
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,910
Cakviungramta yuut tamarmeng aturaat.
Though we struggle, all people experience it.

169

Aturaat yuut tamarmeng.
All people experience it.

170
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:46,140
Yuk-llu kiimi piyukevkenani, yuut tamarmeng cakviutulliniut umyuameggnek
And a person shouldn’t think they’re the only one, since all people struggle with mental health

171
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,910
Iliini wani cakneq cakviuraqluteng.
Sometimes having great troubles.

172
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,670

Also, this was said, people said this:

They said that one who thinks they’re alone become severely depressed, until eventually they go insane.

They said it’s because he thinks like this: "I am the only one struggles with mental health."

However, all people in the world suffer here.

176
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:35,250
Taumek wani waten pivkenata, umyuamteńek kiimeta nangteqsukevkenata.
That’s why we should think that we’re the only ones struggling with mental health.

177
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:47,800
Tau͡gaam umyuaqaqluki allat-llu nangteqellriit, tau͡gaam-llu pray-autaqluki wangkucicetun nangtequrlurmilriit umyuameggnek.
Instead, we should remember others with mental health problems, but pray for the ones who are also struggling with mental health like us.

178
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:56,470
Maa-i wani cakneq erenret ilaitni cakviurnaqluni erneq tekitelartuq.
Now, some days, a day comes where it is very hard.

Now, let’s not think we’re the only ones who think that.

182

Instead, let all of us people consider each other
Instead, let all of us people consider each other

Aling kingu’urrluku camera-liurteńgurtellriaten qimugteḿek.
Oh my, you’re late and ended up fixing the camera for the dog.
