It showed the wisdom concerning life. I started off with that.

19
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,870

You know, we shouldn’t [?], and stop lying.

Also, we must stop thinking malicious things about those around us, and do not think bad things about people in secret.

Tua-i waten pitaluku.
That’s all for that.

It’s time that we hear this.

Some people tell me that I should talk about this here on KYUK

So that my voice would spread out more like this.

Qagkut-ll’ ilaita yaaqvaarmiut Kuigpagmiut-llu pilaryaaqaatnga ak’anek ayaglua allrakuni.
Some people up there, far away from the Yukon, have also been telling me for many years.

Tau͡gaam ukut KYUK-rmiut wiinga tua-i capeqluki ullayuitanka uum ciungani.
But since I found it daunting to go to KYUK, I wouldn’t go to them before this.

29

Cali-llu yualaryaaqellruunga mat’um-wa tua-i qanrutkarkama wangni pinruluku qanrutkestekaanek.
Also, I used to look for someone to who could speak about this better than I could.

30
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:47,800
Tau͡gaam ilaita-llam pilaraatnga
However, some of them would say to me

31
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:58,290
Aren allamek-gguq wangni qanrutkeluaqanrustekaituq. Wiinga-gguq qanruteklaku tau͡gaam.
Oh my, they said that there is no one who can say it better than me. They said that I should speak about it instead.

32
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,340
Tua-i waniwa cayaqlirluku qanqautekqata’arqa.
Now, I am finally going to speak about it.

33
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:14,640
Atam wiinga tua-i avani ella iqukluku qantullratni, anguanka au͡gkut ella iqukluku qantulriit.
You see, when they used to speak about the end of the world, I was born in time to see the ones who spoke about the end of the world.

34
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:23,890
Tamana-wa tua-i ak’a yaaqvani piitnaq qanrutketullrat qanrutkelartai angullruanka tua-i.
Well, I was born in time to see the ones who spoke about the time of famine far in the future.

35

Tua-ll’ tang ataucim tang au͡g’um qanellra tua-i tang waniwa umyuaqelgurikeka tang tua-i.
Then, you see, what that one person said always comes to mind now.

36
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:44,080
Tua-i-ll’ umyuaqelguriamku ella tang tua-i una aaryaruskeka iqukvanerrlugqurainarnayukluku.
Then since it always come to my mind, I’ve become wary of this world, thinking that it would end badly.

37
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:51,700
Kiima-llu pinritliniluku. Tua-i ilaita aaryagutaat una ella.
And I’m not the only one. Some others have become wary of this world.

38
00:04:53,075 --> 00:05:05,250
Tua-i tamaani atam maaten murilkessagutua angukara’urluut arnassagaat ilait waten ciisqugni ayaperlukek piyuayaurrluteng
Back then, you see, I realized when I became observant that some old men and women would walk, supporting themselves on their knees like this

39
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,100
Ilait tau͡gken piyuananrirluteng
Yet some couldn’t walk anymore

And when they were done, they brought in the ones who couldn’t walk anymore.

43
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:32,630
Tua-ll’ ella iqukluku qanllermeggni waten ilait qanellruut:
Then when they spoke about the end of the world, some of them said this:

Tamaa-i-gguq tamakut ak’allaunqurrit tamatum tua-i ellam aciani
They said that those who are the oldest there under the earth

45
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,520
Tamatum niitetullemta aciani yuullret tamakut ak’allaunqurrit
Those who lived, the oldest ones, under the one we used to hear about

46
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:54,160
Qanertut, "Yuk-gguq yuunertuqeryaaqaquq. Tamana-gguq aipiringaitaa."
They said, "A person lives for quite a long time. (S)he will not live another [life]."

47
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,830
Tua-i cali waten qanertut:
They also said this:

48
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:06,560

You see, they said, a long time ago... when they used to speak about the end of the world a long time ago

49
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,660
Atam-gguq ilait makut nukalpiat
You see, they said, some of these great hunters

50
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:20,255
Waten qasgimi taklangyullerminek-llu qanelria tauna angukara’urluq un’gani caniqami qanelria niilluku
After this old man was laying in the community house, he said listening to the one by the wall near the door say

51
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:28,445
Ilii-gguq tang maktaqellria, "A, amci-gguq-qaa piyuan tungenqegturanemteńi."
They said that one of them got up, "Ah, it should happen already while we are [doing well]."

52
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:32,475
Cunawa-gguq tamaa-i tamatum pistekameng mallgillrani.
They said that it was apparently when the one who would [?take] them was getting close.

53
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:41,930
Yuut-gguq iciw’ ilacingllermeggni-gguq cunawa ilaciqanricuitut-gguq yuut
They said that when people, you know, apparently waited for others to act, you know people sometimes wait for others to act

54
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:50,450
Anucimirqecetaarumallerkameng-wa tua-i tamatum piciqiangaqateng mallgikateng.
When they ask to be set free when what they’re about to do is approaching.

55
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:55,165
Tua-ll’ tamaani, tamaa-i tamatum nalliini
Then at that time, at that time

56
00:06:55,735 --> 00:07:03,335
Wiinga-ll’ tua-i tamakut erenret tanglallruanka. Tuar tang uksumi ataucimi pillrulriit.
I also used to see those days. I think those happened over one winter.

57
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:14,790
Ernertangyaurtellruuq waten erenrillermi kinguani qavaggun ernertangyarani kiatruarrluku negrem tua-i tungiikun.
Day started breaking after dawn like this further upriver, past where the day breaks toward the north.

58
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:17,905
Ernekegtaar unuurrluni.
The wonderful day became night.

59
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:26,275
Tua-i qanlartut ilait tamakut angutet erneruaryaurrniluku, camek iquliqsaunaku.
Some of those men say that the day has become false, without any further explanation.

00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:34,805
Tua-llam cat iliitni akusrarrluta tua-i laanguarluta tua-i tan’geriluni tua-i.
Then one day, we were playing excitedly, and it got dark.

61
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:42,625
Enemun, enemun tua-i anglicartekellregma enekenrilkiignun iterlua.
I went into a house that was not of those who raised me.

62
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:47,455
Tua-i-ll’ itqanemkun arnaq au͡gna iterluni kingumkun.
Then right when I went in, that woman came in after me.

63
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,765
Tua-ll’ itrami kanani aqumvailegmi qanertuq, "Tua-i-am keggna ernertanglliniuq."
Then when she came in, she said before she sat down there, "There is now day out there."

64
00:07:53,765 --> 00:08:02,020
Tua-ll’ tauna tamatum enem yuin angukara’urluat angukara’urluq qanertuq
The the old man of that house said

65
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:08,700
"When this world is on the brink [of ending], it doesn’t leave its people in the dark.
"When this world is on the brink [of ending], it doesn’t leave its people in the dark.

66
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:12,065
"Tau͡gaam-gguq atam elpegcilirraatui.
"But, you see, it gives them notice first.

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:19,560
"Atam-gguq tamaa-i elpegcilirai tua-i tamana aturarkani ellangcautekani.
"Look, it is giving notice to them about the lesson it’s going to teach them.

00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:26,615
"Pinariata tua-i elliin yun’i tangerrluki, makut nunami yuulriit tangerrluki tua-i pinariata.
"It sees its people, sees the people on this earth because it’s time for them.

69
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:32,265
"Atam-gguq tamaa-i nasvagaa ellaitnun tua-i tamaa-i tamaaggun piarkaurrluki."
"Look, it is showing it to them, and will [correct] them through that."

70
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:37,895
Tua-ll’ qanertuq, "Atam-gguq yuut neryuniuryaaqniartut.
Then he said, "People will wait expectantly.

71
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:47,305
"Atam-gguq neryuniuryaaqvimeggnek neryuniunrirniartut, neryuniulriartairulluni-llu.
"Watch, as they are eagerly waiting, they will stop waiting eagerly, then there will be no one left who is wating eagerly.

72
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:53,100
"Atam-llu-gguq ella iqukluku qanelriamek niitnanrirniartut."
"And watch, they will stop hearing anyone say the world is ending."

73
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,680
Tua-i maa-i taum qanellra tua-i nall’aringaarput.
We now coincide with what he said.

74
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:09,770
Cali-llu-gguq atam qanikcangqerrnanrirniartuq wagg’uq ata ataucimun ellimangkuniu.
He also said that there would be no more snow, that is, when [the world] starts putting it into one place.

75
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,600
Tua-i taum qanellra waniwa tua-i umyuaqelguriaqa.
Now, what he said always comes to mind.

76
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,110
Tua-i ella una aaryagutaqa. Wiinga ellam uum catacia nalluyaaqaqa.
I am not wary of this world. I don’t know what this world is doing.

77
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,220
Tua-ll’ cali waten qanellruut:
Then, they also said this:

78
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,660
"Meluk," kiingan tua-i qanrutketullruat.
"Fish roe," it was the only one they mentioned.

79
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:38,580
Meluk-gguq man’a tua-i allrakurtaaryaaqeciquq nunam iluani.Tua-i-gguq cangaringaituq.
They said that fish roe would be in the land year after year. They said it wouldn’t spoil.

80
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:44,835
Yuum iluanun alingnaringaituq nunam iluani tua-i allrakurtaange’rmi.
It will not become dangerous inside a person though it spends year after year in the land.

81
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,370
Tua-i kiingan qanrutketullruat.
That was the only one they mentioned.

82
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,270
Tua-ll’ mat’um nalliini makut freezer-aat piyaaqut.
Then these days, there are now freezers.

83
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:57,185
Tau͡gaam malruugut makut, freezer-aaq man’a malruuguq.
But there are two things, there are two things [that don’t spoil] in freezers.

84
00:09:57,185 --> 00:10:05,255
Tau͡gaam una sulunaq umyuarteqaqama cali allrakurtaaryaaqmiciquq elluarrluni taryiumakuni
But when I think about this salted fish, it may also spend year after year if it is salted well

85
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:09,570
Allrakut tegulang’ermiki tua-i cangaringailmiuq tauna.
It may take on years, but that will not spoil either.

86
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,600
Man’a-ggem tua-i freezer-aaq malruuguq. Catacia nallunartuq.
There are two things [that don’t spoil] in freezers. What it does is irregular.

87
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:24,240
Tua-ll’ cali mat’um nalliini ukut aipaiput tua-i qagruyaaqut watua maa-i ernermi qak’mumi.
And these days, our [Caucasian] counterparts are [?] in this current day.

88
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:32,295
Tau͡gaam ayainanermeggni-wa nallunartuq umyuarteqaqama.
But as they go, it’s hard to know when I think about it.

89
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:38,550
Atam niicaurtellrianga ak’anek, ak’arrarnek tayim’ ayaglua
Look, I’ve started hearing since a long time ago, since quite a while ago

90
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,260
Ak’mum nunam wiinga tangssuilkeḿa yugyalriim
In those lands way over there that I do not see where there are a lot of people

91
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:50,350
It started getting cold where they do not know cold; it started snowing where they do not know snow.
It started getting cold where they do not know cold; it started snowing where they do not know snow.

92
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,270
Tua-i tamakut naucetaat assircanrirai.
That is negatively affecting crops.

93
00:10:55,275 --> 00:11:02,350
Cali-llu tayima piyagaat, tua-i cat cali piyugngalriit assircanrirai.
It is also negatively affecting animal young, whatever wildlife there is.

94
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,930
Tayima akemkut wiinga tua-i tangssuilkeḿa yui
Maybe the people of the lands that I do not see

Nasperturluteng ellait, naugillerteng-wa tua-i nasperturluku.
They are trying, trying [things] with their crops.

96
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,150
Umyuarteqaqama tamaańnguaqerlua
When I think about it and pretend I’m there

97
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:25,855
Unguvaseng tunulluku Alaska-m yuinek arcaqakingaitut.
They will not turn their back on their lives and consider Alaskan people more important.

98
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:34,590
Cali-am waten qanrutqerciullruunga, mumignganrilngurnek-am qanrutqerciullruunga elisngalriamek:
I was also told this, I was told this that was untranslated from a knowledgeable person:

"Naucetaalget-gguq naucetaamegteggun pimaarkaugut. Neqelget neqmegteggun pimaarkauluteng."
"Those with crops must [survive] with their crops. Those with food [from animals] must survive with their foor [from animals]."

100
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:47,665
Tua-ll’ tauna waten cali qanertuq:
Then he also said this:

"Atam-gguq yuut nepengniartut, tua-i ellalkangluteng. Camek atanqaanrirluteng."
"Watch, people will start fighting, acting crazy. They will no longer await anything."

103
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:10,675
Tua-i tang maa-i man’a cali waten ayuqellria tua-i maa-i nall’aringaarput qakemkuni ernerni watua maa-i.
You see, we are corresponding to what is like this in these current days.

104
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:13,225
Ilateng tua-i cakenrirluki.
They care nothing for their families anymore.

105
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:23,900
Aling cali mat’um nalliini nallunaipagta maurluat una qanqerteńgunripagta.
Oh my, it is clear these days that their grandmother is not a teacher.

106
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:31,200
Cali-llu wangkurlumta tang apa’urlurluitni maani cailkami qanqerteńguvkenata.
Also, you see, we poor grandfathers of their are also not teachers in random places here.

107
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:39,640
Tuarpiaq tang tua-i makut kingum yui, tuarpiaq tua-i tangvagluki anglanitekellriacetun ayuqluki.
It truly seems that the chidlren of the next generation, it truly seems that we watch them with levity.

108
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,660
Inqautaunata mat’um nalliini.
We have no [?affection] these days.

109
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:47,065
Tua-ll’ umyuarteqaqama
Then when I ponder

110
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:53,700
Ella una piciqiaquni waten, uksuq man’a aturciqiange’rmiu
When the world is on the verge of doing this, though it is on the verge of going through this winter

111
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,460
Yun’i qanrusngaitai maa-i watua piqatarniluki.
It will not tell it’s people that it’s going to do it now.

112
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:01,935
Cunaw’ tang tamaa-i ava-i.
It turns out it was all of that.

113
00:13:01,935 --> 00:13:10,990
Ak’a tamalkuita pinrilnguunaki tamaa-i nasvallruamiu qanrulluki yun’i tamaaggun, tamaaggun piarkaurrluki.
It had already shown its people through that, without leaving anything out, that it would do that.

114
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,950
Tua-ll’ cali waten qanertuq tauna angukara’urluq:
Then, that old man also said this:

115
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:21,585
"Atam-gguq tamana tamaa-i mallguskan piitnaq
"Watch, when that time of famine is nigh

116
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:32,590
"Waniwa-gguq ukuk ciiq, imarpinraq, atam-gguq kuignun neq’lirtuutengniartuq, neq’lirtuutengniartuk."
These two, sheefish, Bering cisco, watch, they rivers will be filled with those two fish."

117
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:41,250
Tua-i-gguq waten yuk nangulluni-w’ tua-i taukuk aipaagnek nerqerarkangqerrluni.
He said that when a person runs out [of food] like this, one of those two will be his source of food.

118
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:49,905
Taukuk-gguq aipaagnek nerqaquciqsaaquq. Ilangcivkenani-gguq atam kemgiutniartuq, kemga iggniartuq.
He said that he will eat a lot of one of those two. He said that despite that, he will grow skinny, his flesh falling off.

119
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:55,315
Neqek taukuk elluatuk assilriik uqulgulutek-llu
Those to healthy and good fish that are also fatty

120
00:13:55,485 --> 00:14:00,915
"Tua-i-gguq," qanertuq tauna, "tua-i-gguq taulkuk neqek piitnam tamatum neqek."
"So," he said, "so those two are the fish of famine."

121
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:08,745
Tua-i man’a avaullrunritaqa. Maa-i-w’ tua-i umyuaqelguriamku tua-i ella una aaryagutaqa.
I haven’t forgotten this. Since it always comes to mind now, I’ve become wary of this world.

122
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:12,100
Tua-ll’ cali waten qanellruut au͡gkut:
Then, people back then also said this:

123
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:20,750
"Ukut-gguq waniwa taryaqviinkut, iqalluunkut, qakiiyaankut, taukut-gguq piirtuyuitut."
"These three, king salmon, chum salmon, silver salmon, those don’t run out."

124
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:27,680
Taumek-gguq maa-i watuam nalliini kingumta yuinun waten au͡gkut ellaita qanruyutekellruat:
That’s why they gave this piece of traditional wisdom to the children of our descendants today like this:

125
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:36,700
Taukut tua-i kuimallratni yuk piyugngakan qaategtevkenaku piyugngataciatun tamaaken tegutesqelluku.
While those are swimming, if a person is able, he should not be lazy, but take as much as he can from them.

126
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:41,855
Inerquutekluku man’a uksuaq qagqesqevkenaku.
They admonished against [?being unprepared for] fall.

127
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:51,610
Tamana-gguq atam aturarkaukuniu uksuq tamakut tamaa-i kinguqliktukai tamarmeng atam-gguq cataitniartut.
They said that if it is going to have that kind of winter, all of the things that come after them will be gone.

128
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,510
Man’a maa-i umyuaqelguriaqa.
This always comes to mind now.

129
00:14:56,515 --> 00:15:02,830
Tua-ll’ tamatum tamaa-i piitnam tuskateng
Then when that famine comes upon them

130
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:08,610
Cali au͡gna waten qanqautesciullruunga. Ak’arraurtuq.
I was also told about that. It’s been quite a while.

131
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:14,625
Cali umyuamnun agtuutellruuq waten qanqautesteḿa qanqautaanga
It also moved my mind when the one who told me told this to me

132
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:19,635
Elliin umyugaanun cali agtuutelliniuq waten qanerluni:
It also moved his mind as he said this:

133
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:23,710
Tauna-gguq tang qavangurtulria kuvyaluni.
He said that he dreamt he was drift netting.

134
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:30,550
Tua-i waten aterrluni, qaill’ tua-i kuvyilarceta, kuvyilarceci.
He let the current carry him, however we drift net, you drift net.

135
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:34,365
Tua-i-ll’ pinariami imegluni.
Then when it was time, he rolled up his net.

136
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:43,455
Imginanrani neqa kan’a alairtuq, enret tamimek caquluteng amta-ll’ pektanqeggluni.
As he was rolling up his net, a fish appeared down there, entirely covered in bones yet was moving.

137
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:48,510
Tua-ll’ alairami qanrutlinia tauna cangtaqesteńi
Then when it appeared, it said to the one who caught it

138
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,960
"Uitaqaa. Malrugnek qanerkangqertua."
"Wait a second. I have two things to say."

139
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,900
Tua-ll’ pillinia tauna cangtaqesteńi
Then it said to the one who had caught it

140
00:15:56,905 --> 00:16:04,715
"Tayima-gguq allrakut amllenrilnguut kinguatni piitnaq tut’eqatartuq
"After a few years, the time of famine is going to come

141
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:08,185
"Cali-llu tegelgem yua pekteqatarluni."
"And the spirit of theft is going to be active."

142
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:17,060
Atam au͡gkut wiinga tua-i angullrenka, anguyaaqekenka tua-i qanqaquuryaaqellriameng
Look, though the people I was born to see had talked for a long time

143
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,300
Nutaan atam wiinga tegelgem yuanek niitellrianga.
You see, that was the first time I heard about the spirit of theft.

144
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:26,515
Tua-ll’ taum tua-i qanqautestellma mat’um kinguani
Then after that person spoke to me

145
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:33,045
Tuar tang maa-i yuut allamiaqan tuar tang arcarikanilalriit. Tuar tang arcarikanilalriit.
It seems that every year, people get worse. They seem to get worse.

146
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:38,400
Waten ilateng qinuuqluki. Teglegiluki, neqairluki tuaten.
They do not share with their families. They steal from them, even take their food away.

147
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,860
Yuut maa-i watua umyuarteqaqama
When I ponder upon these people now

148
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:48,075
Mayiteqkuneng uuggun aqsaqumegteggun qaillun pitaqatartat?
If these they desire what was taken away from their stomachs, how far will they go?

149
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,290
Ilateng-llu allurtelarciqait.
They will also take from their families.

150
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,760
Wall’u tua-i yuut makut avanicetun ayuqenrirtut.
Or, these people are not like long ago anymore.

151
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,210
Ilait uluryairulluteng, ilait-ll’ alingnariluteng.
Some have no more inhibitions, and some have gotten dangerous.

152
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,260
Ilii-llu neqrangqerrniluni tuqutauciquq-llu.
And one of them will be killed because he has a little food.

153
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,170
Tua-i taklirivakartuq. Waten pitaaqa.
It’s getting to long. This is all I will say about it.

154
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,670
Quyana Chimigalrea.
Thank you Chimigalrea.

155
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:14,835
Waniwa Asaacararmiut curukallratni suurkiullrulliniut Imangarmiut yurartai.
Now, the dancers of Emmonak recorded a video when Mountain Village held a challenge feast.

156
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:16,464
Quyana. WIinga Qang’allugaugua.
Thank you. I am Qang’allugaq.
