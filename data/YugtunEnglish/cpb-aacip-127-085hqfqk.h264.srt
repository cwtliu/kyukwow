Starting from the spring, they would eat birds until they went downriver like this. It was their food, along with their eggs.

Then they would eat those birds like this in the spring up until there were fish.

50
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:41,751
Cetuameng tau͡gaam taqluki, ayanqigtevkenateng.
They only stopped when they went downriver, didn’t go out hunting again.

Nuna tua-i yugtairulluku waten Akula, imarpigmi, unani tau͡gaam Kusquqvagmi.
There would be no one left in the Akula region like this, but only down in the ocean, on the Kuskokwim.

Neqnun cali cauluteng. Amllepiarluteng call’ neqet.
They would turn to fish. There were also a great many fish.

Tamaaggun-wa kencikellratgun Agayutem cikiutekngamiki kencikellratgun tua-i amllerrlainartelluki.
Through their reverence, since they are Gods gifts, they were always in plenty through their reverence.

Maa-i mat’um nalliini umyuangcarqama tamakut neqrateng tua-i makut neqteng murilkelluki, mulngakluki.
When I ponder upon it these days, they watched over and were careful about what food they had, their food.

55
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:33,651
Neq’lipiatullruuq agaani waten tan’gaurlullraullemteńi.
There used to be a lot of fish across there when we were boys like this.

People back then revered them.

And there are no more of these little birds because we don’t hunt them with arrows anymore.

Tau͡gken makut aipaimta kellutestaita amllericangnaqsaaqluki inerquuteksagulluki pissuyuirutevkarluki yaqulget.
However, these [Caucasian] counterparts of ours who regulate them, make restrictions to try to elevate their populations, and have us stop hunting birds.

They would start hunting those too.

They would fill their kayaks and arrive en masse.

Iciw’ pellaalliaqa wall’u-q’ qaill’ piaqata kaingaqameng canek nertullruat yuilqumi?
You know, if they happened to get lost or something happened, what would they eat in the wilderness if they got hungry?

00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:45,627
Kaingaqameng-qaa neqkaunateng?
You mean when they get hungry without food?

00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:47,048
Maa-i makut uugnaraat neqkaugut cailkuni yuilqumi, tau͡gaam kenengqerquni.
These voles are a source of food if one has nothing in the wilderness, but only if they have a fire.

87
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:51,911
Tamakut tamaa-i neqkauyaaqut.
