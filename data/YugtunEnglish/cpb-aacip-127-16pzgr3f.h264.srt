00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Kitak’ qanraqaa.
Please speak.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,500
Tua-llu-q’ tua-i qaill’ ayuqeqatarta qanaallerpuk?
What’s our conversation going to be like?

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,000
Assirciqnganani-q’ tua-i piuq tuani massiinaam iluani?
Does it seem like it’ll be good in that machine?

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Tua-i-w’ taklirinrilengraan-llu antarkaten aneskuvki egmianun
camek nagutaunak.
Even if it’s not too long, you can say what you have to say
without lingering on anything.

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Assirtuq, canrituq.
It’s good, it’s fine.

6
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:11,000
Wiinga-wa ellangellemkun elpe’ngllemkun qanaalalrianga.
I only speak of my earliest memories and what I’ve realized.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Cali-llu maa-i-am elpengukut wangkuta tegganerni
Also, we elders have realized now

8
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:31,000
Maaten elpengukut nunavut man’a nakmiin nunavut
pikenrilriatun ayuqlirillrullinikvut.
We realized that it’s like we don’t own our land here,
our very own land, anymore.

9
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,000
Maani tua-i nunamteńi umyugiurngairulluta.
We don’t do what we want on our land anymore.

10
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Tuamta-ll’ cali maani unani mer’utemteńi umyugiurngaunata.
And then, we can't do what we want in our waters either.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,500
Tau͡gaam wani wii qaillun umyuartequralartua
ukegkut yuugarkat umyuaqaqamki.
But I do have some ideas when I think about
the people who will live in the future.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,500
Wangkuta waten ellilriani camun amlleret allrakut tekilluki
maktangaitukut naucetaaruamta yugni.
We who have become like this will not be standing for
many years because we people are [like] flowers.

13
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:19,400
Kingunerput tuaten nauluni.
Tamakut tuaten naulriit ciunret piunrirluni.
Our offspring grow too.
Those first ones who grow pass away.

14
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
Tamana piciuguq.
That’s true.

15
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,000
Mat’umek wani umyuartequralartua:
I always think about this:

16
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:36,500
Uani Naparyarrarni tayima 1971-aam tungiini
Kass’aq tekiteqarraalleq waten qanellruuq:
Downriver in Napakiak, probably around 1971,
a Caucasian who came for the first time said this:

17
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,000
Pissuryaramteńek-gguq cuqcirinrilkumta nunakaitukut.
If we don’t determine our hunting grounds, we won’t have any land.

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Tuani-llu inerquryaaqekenka maligutesqevkenaki
tamakunun allotment-aatnun. Cunawa.
And at the time, I admonished them against following
those allotments. Turns out [I was right].

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Uumiani taum kevgaq tekitenqigtellria qanertuq waten:
Shortly after, that representative arrived again and said this:

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,500
Nuna-gguq man’a patuluku Kass’at taiqatartut.
Caucasians are going to come and cover this land.

21
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,500
Tamatumek-gguq pilinrilkumta nunakaitukut pissurvigkaunata-llu.
[S]he said that if we don’t do that, we will have no lands
or hunting grounds.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,500
Akleng, ukveu͡rlurluta-am wangkuta allotment-aanek qaqiutellinilriakut.
Pity, we believed and established allotments.

23
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,500
Tuamta-llu maaten ellangukut taum kinguani
And then we realized after that

24
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:39,500
Makut wani irniaput tutgaraput-llu maaken wangkutnek
cataunateng, imkut tua-i kenkataput nutem.
That our children and grandchildren have nothing from here
from us, the ones we’ve always loved.

25
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Ukunun aipamteńun tun’aput-qaa? Pikiutekaput-qaa?
Did we give them to our [Caucasian] counterparts?
Did we give it to them?

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,500
Tua-llu-w’ umyuartequralalrianga waten:
And then I think like this:

27
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:10,000
Wangkuta-mi tegganernun, tegganerni wall’u vote-aryugngalriani
nangkumta caqatarta man’a?
When we elders, we elders or those who can vote, are gone,
what’s going to happen to this?

28
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,000
Kia maktatqatartau yuuyaramta tungiinun?
Who’s going to uphold it to our way of life?

29
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,300
Cuqtellemni wii kia maktasngaitellinii.
By my estimate, no one will uphold them.

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Tamakut-llu irniamta Yuunge’rmeng maktasngaitelliniluku
tamana ciumuruskunegteggu.
And even though our children are Yupiit,
they won’t uphold it when they go forward with it.

31
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Tuamta-ll’ cali waniw’ qaneryararkaqa yuut amlleret assikenritaat.
And then, a lot of people don’t like my advice.

32
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Yuut-llu amlleret nall’artevkenaki tayima qanaaciqngatua.
I may not speak correctly about many people.

33
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,000
Waten niitukut, niitellruunga wii qangvaurtellria ukaqvaggun:
We heard, I personally heard recently some time ago:

34
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yup’ik Nation-aarurrluta-gguq wangkuta yuullemteńun ayagciqukut.
If we become the Yup’ik Nation, we will proceed
to our way of life.

35
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,500
Maaten tang, maaten tang tamana wii yuvri’rqa
I examined it and realized

36
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:32,000
Yup’ik Nation-aaruluta natmun yuuyaramta tungiinun
ayagngaitellinilriakut tau͡gaam uungukumta traditional-aaruluta.
That if we’re the Yup’ik Nation, we will not go anywhere with our
way of life, but only if we are traditional.

37
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:44,000
Traditional-aarukumta Kass’amek atanrunata,
wangkutnek tau͡gaam ataniurluta ciungani pillemcetun.
If we are traditional with no Caucasian governers,
but govern ourselves as we did in the past.

38
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:58,000
Man’a-llu allotment-aaq maa-i unuamek nepngurtuq
Yugnun tauna elliin nunautekniluku.
And this allotment has become a cause for unrest
for Yupiit today who claim they own that land.

39
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Man’a maa-i tamamta taringumayaaqerput:
nepngurutnguuq nunautengqelleq.
Wr all understand this:
land ownership leads to unrest.

40
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:22,500
Tau͡gaam nunamek waten angtuarpagmek cet’riluci
akmavet qanerluci pisqumalaryaaqamci.
However, I want youpl to outline a huge area of land like this
and speak of it to [non-Yup’ik people] out there.

41
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Umyuaqa qanlaryaaquq tuaten pisqumaluci.
I say in my mind that I want youpl to do that.

42
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Waniwa akmavet igallruunga allragni.
Last year, I wrote to them out of state.

43
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:50,000
Waniwa-llu tutgarama elliin ayagcetelqeńgamiu
tamana wani iqukarrluku qanresqumiinga qanertua.
And I am speaking of it because my grandchild sent it
and wanted me to end it with that.

44
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Waten qanellruunga, amllerrsaaquq qanelqa, ellangellruniluta
yup’ut tutgaraput-llu tayima tamariniluki.
I’ve said this, I’ve said a lot, that since our earliest memories,
our children and grandchildren are lost.

45
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Tuamta-ll’ cali tamariniluta nunamteńi maani
allanrulriatun ellirluta.
And I say that we are lost in out own lans as if we've become outsiders.

46
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:24,500
Nuna-llu man’a umyugiurutkescigaliniluku ak’a.
Tuar allanruluta.
We’ve already become unable to do what we want on this land.
It’s like we’re outsiders.

47
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:37,000
Kitaki tamana arenqiakekumteggu, ilumun arenqiakekumteggu
traditional-aaq tau͡gaam tangerrnaurput.
Now, if we disapprove of that, if we truly disapprove of that,
let us look at the traditional [way of life].

48
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Waniwa amlleret usviilkeciqaatnga.
Many will call me crazy now.

49
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yup’ik Nation-aaruluta ayakumta akmaken Kass’anek
ataniurterluta ayagciqukut.
If we go forth as the Yup’ik Nation, we will be governed
by Caucasians from out there.

50
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,000
Atam cuq’erteqernaurput. Ak’a AVCP-m ataniraakut.
Let’s gauge the situation. AVCP already governs us.

51
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Ayagcuutekamteńek-llu Yup’igkun kalikat taqumarillriit
tayima tamakut aturluki ayaasqelluta.
Official documents have been established to go as Yupiit
and we are told to go forth with those.

52
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,500
Tamaa-i tang Kass’akun ayagaarkat, ayagarkat.
That is the way to go as Westernized [people].

53
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:27,000
Una tau͡gaam traditional-aaq ellminek piugarkaq,
ellminek piyullermikun ayagarkaq.
But the traditional [way of life] is for us to be ourselves,
so we can go forth as we want.

54
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,500
Umyuama wii cucuksaaqaa nutem tamana
ellangutkellruamku avaken ayagluku.
In my opinion, I prefer that because it has been
part of my earliest memories from long ago.

55
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Nunarraat kitumek atanrunateng. Ilameggnek tau͡gaam
tegganermek atanerluteng pillruut tamarmeng.
Villages didn’t have governers. All of them were
only governed by one of their own elders.

56
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:57,000
Mat’umek wani amllenrilengraan tutgarama umyugaa
narurcuumiilamku qanqertua.
Even though it’s not a lot, I’m speaking about it
because I don’t want to disregard my grandchild’s opinion.

57
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Tua-llu qaill’ ayuqa man’a elpeni?
How does this seem to you?

58
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,500
[?]
Assirtuq. I like it.
[?]
It’s good. I like it.

59
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Yuungnaqellminun-wa tua-i tungiinun.
About how one should traditionally live.

60
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:38,500
Man’a cali tutgarama-am tukriarucaku tayima amlleq
nallungramku tau͡gaam ellmacuar tangrrucimtun, nallunrilucimtun.
Because my grandchild also brought this up, even if I don’t know
a lot, [I’m speaking] only about what little I understand and know.

61
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,000
Tua-i ellmacuar tangerqallruaqa wiinga.
I only saw a little of it.

62
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:54,000
Wangkuta-wa tangerqallruarput man’a apyutii

We saw what [s]he asked about through
how we didn’t see a lot of these [Western] things

63
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,000
Canek piinata anglillerni tamamta.
All of us who have grown up without anything [Western].

64
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,500
Tua-llu uumek waten aptaanga: wangkutnek-gguq piurqumta

And then [s]he asked me this: if we [govern] ourselves,
how will our lives go?

65
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:30,000
Kiuyugngaaqa uumek: ciulirneret tau͡gaam ellangviullruut
ciulirnerem alerquutiikun ayagluni.
I can answer with this: the ancestors were the only ones to
grow up with, going though what the ancestors instructed.

66
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Ciulirnerem-llu alerquutiikun anguss[aagluteng]…
[They] also hunted with the ancestors’ instruction…

67
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Kitak’ cali apyutkellrat ataam cali tailluku ayagnirniartuten.
Now, start by bringing up what they asked.

68
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,400
Yaavet-qaa ekumanrilnguq ilakevkenaku iqulirluku?
Leave out what’s not recorded in there and finish it?

69
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Yaa, kitak’ au͡gna ataam [qane]llren apyutkellra

Yes, please start by bringing up what you [said] about his question.

70
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Ii-i, yaa, au͡g’umek-wa natmun arulailqa uunguciircamku.
(Canrituq. Ayagnirluten.)
Okay, yes, I have no idea where I stopped.
(It’s okay. Just start.)

71
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:34,000
Uumek wani tutgarama apcanga qaillun Yuut ellmeggnek
ellmeggnek piurquneng ayakuneng pillerkaanek aplua.
When my grandchild asked me, [s]he asked about
what will happen if Yupiit governed themselves.

72
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Apcanga tamalkuan nallunrilengramku tau͡gaam tua-i
ellma nallunrilamku
When [s]he asked, even though I [don’t] know everything
since I only know a little

73
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,500
Kiima-w’ nallunritenritaqa. Ilama-llu nallunritaat
waten carugarnun ellangellrunrilngurni.
I’m not the only one who knows. My peers who did not
grow up with a lot of [Western] things like this know it.

74
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Qanruyuteput tua-i niitengnaqluki atungnaqluki-llu pilallruamta

We tried to obey and adhere to our traditional wisdom
back when we didn’t have a lot of things including money.

75
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,500
Tua-llu? Ukutgun tau͡gaam yuk ayagarkauguq ciulirnerteggun.
You see? A person must only go forth
[with the wisdom of] the ancestors.

76
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Ciulirneret, ciulerneq taillruuq nutarauvkenani,
nutem piuluni, nutem qanruyutnguluni.
The elder did not come as a new thing,
[but] as an ancient thing, ancient traditional wisdom.

77
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,500
Ukut-llu munallruluteng neq’liurteput, neqmun alerquuteput.
And those who worked on fish for us were dexterous,
those who instructed us on fish.

78
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:50,000
Waten alerquumaluta: neqmek neqallermek-llu
sagciluta pisqevkenata kumiviitellemteńi.
We were instructed like this: do not make a mess
of food and food scras when we didn’t have freezers.

79
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:59,000
Cuqluku-llu una ulligcista. Cuqluku taqtuluta.
And it depends on the fish cutter. We stopped depending on her.

80
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,000
Tua-i apqiitnek spoil-ararkanek piyuunata.
We wouldn’t [gather] what would spoil, as they say [in English].

81
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:17,000
Tuamta-llu ciulirneret alerquutiitgun nunami pekluta.
Ciulirneret tau͡gaam alerquutiitgun.
And then we also walked on land as the ancestors instructed.
Only though the ancestors’ instruction.

82
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,500
Arcaqerluku alerquun niisngangnaqluku uskuarmi up’nerkami-llu.
We especially tried to obey instruction in the fall and spring.

83
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,500
Tua-i taukuk aarnarqellriaruan nunam qainga
mer’et-llu makut qaingat.
It was because the land and the water were dangerous
in those2 times.

84
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:43,400
Taukugni aarnaqngan tamakunek arcaqerluta

Because it was dangerous in those2 times, our ancestors
especially instructed us on those.

85
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Tuamta-llu yuullerkamteńek mat’umek

And then about how we should live,
how we should live treated our fellow people

86
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Yuunitekluta pisqevkenata inerquumaluta.
They told admonished us against [treating them badly]
just because we’re people.

87
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Tamatum nalliini taringumallrunricaaqerput wangkuta man’a

We didn’t understand this at the time, but we realized
what it was later.

88
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,000
Una wani yuunitekluni yuuyaraq waten ayuqelliniuq:
Living life [treating others badly]
just because we’re people is like this:

89
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:23,000
Yuunitekluni-gguq yuulria qaneni negtaayuitaa ilaminun,
cangayullerkaa-llu yuum umyuaqevkenaku.
A person [who treats others badly] just because he’s a person
does not watch what he says to other people,
and gives no consideration about offending them.

90
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,700
Cali-llu kenekmek piitelliniluni, umyuaqegtaarmek-llu piitelliniluni.
He also does not have love or good thoughts.

91
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,500
Tuaten-llu ayuqellria apqiitnek erneq aipirluku unguvayuunani-gguq.
They say that one who is like that
does not live another day, as they say.

92
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Taumek tamakut wangkuta teggutekaput tamaa-i
Those are our sources of support

93
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:55,000
Makunek kalikarteggun ayangvailemta,
kalikam mat’um ayangvailgakut.
Before we started going with these books,
before these books started dictating us.

94
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,000
Naklegnarqellria takumcunaqluku.
We had mercy on someone pitiful.

95
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Cali-llu man’a wani naklekutvut aturyugnaunaku

Also, the state apprently has this without our compassion:

Eighteen-aaqan-gguq yuum yun’i peggliu qanrutenrirluku,
allakaan-llu yuuvkarluku.
A person should abondon his child when he’s 18,
stop teaching him, and have him live separately.

97
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,000
Tamana wangkuta alerquutekenritarput Yugni.
That is not how we Yupiit are instructed.

98
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yuum-gguq angukara’urluurteng’e’rmi, panini-ll’ ak’allaurtengraan,
qetunrani-ll’ ak’allaurtengraan iqlutun cingyuitaa.
They say that even when a person becomes an old man, though his
daughter gets old, though his son gets old, he does not steer them wrong.
