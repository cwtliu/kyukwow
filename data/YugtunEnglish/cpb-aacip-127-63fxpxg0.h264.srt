For what reason, when I think about it, are they gone since they don’t hunt them anymore?

And our children do not hunt these little birds that we used to shoot arrows at.

What we used to hunt on the land here are no more to be seen.

Then we tied them and hung them in the trees.

Starting from the spring until the birds went downriver like this, they would eat them as their food source including their eggs.

34
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:30,765
Camek niicuunata nangqatalrianek, ikegliinalrianek.
We wouldn’t hear anything about there being no more, or anything depleting.

But they wouldn’t be gone, wouldn’t be affected.

And then, they would eat those birds like this in the spring until there were fish.

40

Cetuameng tau͡gaam taqluki, ayanqigtevkenateng.
They only stopped when they went downriver, stopped going out to hunt.

There was no one left like this in Akula, but [they were] down on the Kuskokwim.

Through there reverence, because they are God’s gifts and they revered them, he always kept them at high numbers.

Maa-i mat’um nalliini umyuangcarqama tamakut, neqrateng tua-i makut neqteng murilkelluki, mulngakluki.
When I think on that these days, they would watch and be careful about whatever food they had.

00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,990
Neq’lipiatullruuq agaani waten tan’gaurlullraullemteńi.
There used to be a lot of fish across there when we were boys like this.

46
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,190

They would also bump each other to the riverbank here.

And sometimes when we were swimming, the fish would bump into us somewhere here.

48
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:26,835
Tua-i-llu mat’um nalliini tua-i kencikenriamceteng cat nangengluteng.
Then these days, since we don’t revere them, there are no more of some things.

And then during beluga hunting season, they would admonish us against wading in water when they were hunting beluga.

Maavet ukalirnermun agaantaqamta ivraqaasqevkenata inerquanauraitkut.
On this side when we were across there, they would admonish us against wading in water.

Tau͡gken makut aipaimta kellutestaita amllericangnaqsaaqluki inerquuteksagulluki pissuyuirutevkarluki yaqulget.
However, our Caucasian counterparts who regulate them are trying to raise bird populations by restricting us from hunting them.

57
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:53,586
Makut yaqulget arulairucuitellruit au͡gkut anglicartemta.
Those who raised us back then didn’t stop hunting these birds.

These things: the sun, and what becomes visible, appears, before the sun in the morning

Maa-i mat’um nalliini alairqata pugnilaqeput, igvarqata-llu pug’aqluteng.
When they become visible these days, we say they appear, and they appear when they come into view.

151
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:45,772
Akerta ikaggun pugtuuq
The sun rises across there

152
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:58,094
Maani tua-i Kusquqviim kanavalirnerani uitakumta.
If we’re here toward the water on the Kuskokwim.

00:22:58,164 --> 00:23:11,858
Una-i un’a Kusquqvak unani caningqauq keggaknerem ping’um waten kepluku.
The Kuskokwim down there is on the side, with the west cutting into it inland.

Arenqiallugeskuni nani maani, wall’u ayuquciireskuni, amirluuskani, pirtunguskani, wall’ taitunguskani
If he gets into misfortune somewhere here, or if he’s lost, if it gets cloudy, if a blizzard sets, or gets foggy

155
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:42,029
Unukani tua-i, wall’u nanluciitqapiarluni pikuni, nani-ll’ Kusquqvak uitacia nallukuniu
If it’s night, or he has absolutely no idea where he is, and he doesn’t know where the Kuskokwim is

156
00:23:42,895 --> 00:23:45,251
Tua-i ayuquciitkacagarluni.
Being completely lost.

157
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:54,002
Atullruarput pingayuuluta Negteḿun ayallemteńi.
Three of us experienced that when we were going to Newtok.

158
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:03,858
Tau͡gaam murilkelallruaqa mat’um ciungani una akerta iraluq-llu.
But before this, I used to observe the sun and moon.

159
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:12,602
Naw’un picuituq. Ikaggun kiaqvaarkun pit’elartuq Kusquqviim akilirnerakun.
It doesn’t rise anywhere else. It rises across there, a ways upriver across the Kuskokwim.

160
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:22,808
Tua-i-llu qerturivailegmi, quyigivailegmi Kusquqviim quliikun ayagluni.
And then, before it gets too high, it goes above the Kuskokwim.

161
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:28,063
Uatmurrluni imarpiim tungiinun.
It goes downriver toward the ocean.

162
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:42,482
Tua-i-llu nutaan imarpiim quliinun, imarpimteńun unavet, imarpimta tunglirneranun elliami nutaan pagaavet ellirluni.
And then when it goes above the ocean, our ocean odown there, toward our ocean, it finally goes up there.

163
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:46,134
Quyigikanirviirulluni agluni.
It goes without going any higher.

164
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:56,780
Tua-i-llu ag’um nunam tunglirneranun piami cali, cali ellurluni nunamun mat’umun ipcarturluni.
And then when it goes across toward the land, it goes down to disappear on the land here.

165
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:06,710
Iraluq cali-llu akerta.
The moon and the sun.

166
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:15,590
Tuamtellu iciw’ Qaluuritmek, nallunritarci. Qaluuritmek pillalriaci.
And then, you know, the Big Dipper (Qaluurin), you know it. You talk about the Big Dipper.

167
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,777
Nallunritan?
Do you know it?

168
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:24,840
Tauna Qaluurin Tunturyugmek pitullruarput wangkuta. Tunturyuk.
We used to refer to the Big Dipper as Tunturyuk. Tunturyuk.

169
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:39,777
Tauna tua-i cali Erenret Iquata eniumaralriatun, caumauralriatun ayuqelaraat.
It’s like Erenret Iquat [?constellation?] points them to a certain direction, like it faces a direction for them.

170
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:50,861
Tua-i akerta tevirluni pikan murilkeciquci Erenret Iquat caumaluku.
When the sun sets, you will observe that it faces Erenret Iquat.

171
00:25:51,451 --> 00:26:01,973
Tua-i-llu avaggun ayagluni, agaaggun ayagluni, agaalirnerkun.
And then it goes over there, goes through the area across there on the other side.

172
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:10,260
Tua-i-ll’ tamaavet imarpilirneq mallgiamiu kanarrluni.
And then when it gets close to the ocean there, it bends down.

173
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:20,504
Kanarteqanrakun imkut Erenret agkut alairluteng, tanqigiyarturluni agna akertem tunglirnera.
As soon as it bends down, Erenret [Iquat] appear, and the area toward the sun brightens.

174
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:25,248
Tauna tua-i cali cuqyutraq’lallruaqa.
I also used that to find my bearings.

175
00:26:25,277 --> 00:26:36,510
Tua-ll’ tuani, pim, Negteḿek tailuta kampaassarput assiitelliniluni navgumaluni.
And at that time, you know, as we were coming from Newtok, our compass was bad and broken.

176
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:39,508
Kiatmurtelliniluta.
We had apparently gone upriver.

177
00:26:40,987 --> 00:26:46,832
Imarpigmun-llu kanaryukluta tan’geriqatarluku.
We thought we were going down to the ocean as it was getting dark.

178
00:26:51,023 --> 00:27:03,067
Imarpigmun kanaryuklemteńi uterrluta tumllemteggun nunamun piluta. Nanluciitkacagarluta.
When we thought we were going to the ocean, we backtracked and went to the land. We had no idea where we were.

179
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:11,224
Pelatekarluta tua-i inarrluta mecungnaringa’rcan.
We set up a tent and went to bed as it started getting wet.

180
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:27,441
Tua-i-llu qavainanemteńi uiga’rtua pelatekaq man’a tanqigceterrlugluni nenglaitellruami-llu.
And then as we were sleeping, I opened my eyes, and the tent was a little bright, also because it was warm.

181
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:34,818
Maaten caugartaqa kumlanaku, pakemna tanqigcesnganan’.
I faced it and found that it was cold, and it seemed bright up there.

182
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:48,223
Piunga pelatekaq callaneruangqerran tekemnek waten pirraarluku piunga iraluq ingna.
Because the tent had a little hold, after doing this with my forefinger, I saw that the moon was over there.

183
00:27:48,344 --> 00:27:51,826
Tua-i nutaan ayuqucinglua.
I finally understood where we were.

184
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:56,125
Kusquqvak tua-i una’antelliniluni.
The Kuskokwim was down there.

185
00:27:57,648 --> 00:28:02,337
Uilluta tua-i uisngaluta.
We woke up.

186
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:11,846
Tua-i-ll’ nanluciicaaqengramta ilagka piagka Kusquqviim tungiinun ayakatarniluta.
And then, even though we didn’t know where we were, I told my companions that we were going to go toward the Kuskokwim.

187
00:28:12,506 --> 00:28:16,917
Tua-i ayagluta Kusquqviim tungiinun.
So, we went toward the Kuskokwim.

188
00:28:19,728 --> 00:28:33,627
Au͡gna-am cali qemini kuik Qurrlurnanek pitulput, umyuarteqluta tamakuukan elitaqciqniluku.
Also, that river among the hills that we called Qurrlurnat, we thought that we would recognize it.

189
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:39,478
Ayainanemteńi-ll’ tua-i elitaqiluta.
And as we went, we recognized things.

190
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:49,734
Taumek waten alerqutullrukaitkut murilkerrlainarluku ca maani nunam qaingani pekatesqelluta.
That’s why they would instruct us to observing everything on the land as we went.

191
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:54,578
Nallunairturrlainarluki.
We should always make them landmarks.

192
00:28:54,614 --> 00:29:00,403
Makut-llu kavirlirraat cuqkurluki.
Also, we should always find our bearings with these [willows with red bark].

193
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:10,214
Nunat-llu tungiit assi’irqan ca imna kingunemteńun elli’irqan, tauna tua-i cuqyuka’aqluku.
And the things toward land, when it’s good, when it goes to our home villages, use those to find our bearings.

194
00:29:10,813 --> 00:29:18,513
Ca-llu cali maani nanvarra’ar qertuuralria-llu tuanlucia nalluvkenaku.
Also, we should know where ponds or elevated areas are here.

195
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,491
Alerquumatullruukut tuaten.
That’s how we were instructed.

196
00:29:22,524 --> 00:29:38,824
Atam-gguq pitsaqa’artevkenata elitaqkumteggu kingunerput imna assiilengraan tuaggun tua-i tunglirnequcia tuanlucia nalluarkauvkenaku.
They said that if we happen to recognize it, even when the weather’s bad, we will know which direction and where our home villages are.

197
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:55,543
Taumek murilkerrlainarluta-w’ tua-i au͡gkut anglicartemta waten ayagalaasqellrukaitkut. Ca murilkerrlainarluku.
That’s why those who raised us back then would tell to always be observant as we traveled like this. We should always observe everything.

198
00:29:56,868 --> 00:30:07,131
Avairqan-ll’ unugmi agyat pagkut nallunairturturluki tuanlucia.
And when it gets clear at night, mark where the stars above are.

199
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:19,143
Wall’u nuna cali tunglirnerani tauna agyaq uitakan, tuani tua-i taukumiut tuantarkauluteng.
Or if a star is in the direction of a village, that village will be [marked as being] there.

200
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:24,656
Tau͡gaam cali enemeggni uitaurayuunateng.
But, they also wouldn’t stay in their houses all the time.

201
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:37,856
Cuqluku ayagarkauluni nateqsigikaniraqluni tauna agyat tuaten ayalria cuq’errnguarluku.
They would gauge it when traveling in a certain dirionction, using those stars to get their bearings like that.

202
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:42,756
Tuaten tua-i wangkuta atullruarput.
We experienced it like that.

203
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:48,375
Kiituan elitaqillerkamteńun tekilluta.
We eventually reached placed we recognized.

204
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,975
Ayallemteńi-llu cali taiciryaaqluni.
And it was even foggy when we traveled.

205
00:30:52,019 --> 00:31:05,631
Tau͡gaam tuaggun iralukun Kusquqviim tunglirnequcia nalluvkenaku.
But with that moon, I knew which way the Kuskokwim was.

206
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:16,644
Qanrullukek-ll’ ilagka waten: tua-i uquiruskumta piyuagurluta Kusquqvagmun unavet ayagciqniluta.
And I told my companions this: if we run out of fuel, we will walk down to the Kuskokwim.

207
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:22,113
Amta-ll’ cataunani Kusquqvak taiciami.
