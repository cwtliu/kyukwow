If we move to that village that is not our own where we grew up, we should live carefully.

You know, this is what they especially admonished against:

101
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:33,747
Ilaten, ilavet, yuullgutvet, egilrallgutvet imumek nepliutekaatnek naucinritengnaqkina tamaani nunakenrilkevni.
Do not try to sow discord among those around you, your fellow people who go through life with you, there where it’s not your home village.

Atam-gguq tuaten tamana atunrilkuvgu, naucilaquvet nepliutekamek nunakenrilkevni
Watch, they said, if you do not heed that, if you sow discord where it’s not your home village

103
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:47,273
Angayuqaagken yuarniaragket taukut nunat
That village will wonder about your parents.

"Qaillun qanruteksaitellruat-qaa tan’gaurluullrani angayuqranek?“
"How, has he not been instructed by his parents when he was a boy?"

105
00:15:57,211 --> 00:16:06,786
Nallumni-gguq aracqerluteng tamana qanrutkeciqaat naucitukuma nunakenrilkemni nepliutekaatnek.
They said they will especially say that without my knowledge if I sow discord where it’s not my home village.

And though I want to tell them about that traditional wisdom here, I cannot tell them

Tua-i taringengailata tamatumek waten Yugtun, Kass’aturrlainaq qanngengameng makut watua.
Because they won’t understand Yup’ik like this since they only speak English now.

Tau͡gaam waten naw’un-wa maaggun taringecetaarturluku piurallrat assinruurtuq
But it’s better to give them examples or metaphors through these things

Waten acirturluki-w’ caluki anagulluki pissiyaagpek’naki.
Not excessively naming them or whatever.

And though this wasn’t my grandmother, when my maternal aunt instructed my older sisters

00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:46,195
Ayuqsarpigaqapiarluki iluarullutek, tau͡ga qaneryaraa tamana ayuqelliniuq.
Being almost exactly the same, in conjuction, her traditional wisdom was the same.

Inerquutaat-ll’ atauciuluni. Alarquuteklengnaaraat cal’ atauciuluni.
Their admonishments are one and the same. Their instructions are also one and the same.

You wouldn’t hear any surprising [different] traditional wisdom.

We didn’t have children like this a long time ago where things were readily available.

120
00:25:44,864 --> 00:25:50,764
Maa-i maa-i-rpagminicetun pillrunritukut.
We didn’t do things like how they do it now.

Instead, we took care of children as our instructors told us to.

122
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:05,859
Qavarput peggluku, qavarput arcaqakevkenaku.
We forsook sleep; we didn’t indulge in sleep.

Then as we were told, we would only breastfeed them ourselves, only breastfeed them

124
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:19,496
Kass’artarnek pisqevkenaki inerquumalallrucimcetun.
As we were admonished against nursing them with Western bottles.

125
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:30,696
Tua-i-llu cali qavarput peggluku aulukesqumaciicetun maurluumteńek, anaanamteńek-llu wall’u
Then as we were instructed to forsake sleep to take care of them by our grandmothers, or our maternal aunts

126
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:39,015
Unugmi qava’arqamta, maa-i nallunritaci mikelnguyagaat cimiriuryaraugut.
When we slept at night, you know that children’s diapers need to be changed now.

As they told us to forsake sleep

Egmian qavaqackarraarluta caugaurqaarluki-llu qurreksaitelliniata qurruksuayagaitnun qurr’urtelluki wall’ anartelluki.
Right after we slept for a short time and turned to them, when they hadn’t urinated, we would let them urinate or defecate into their little waste containers.

130
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:04,810
Terr’ilitanun, terr’ilitanek naanguartu’rpek’nata.
We didn’t have an easy time with diapers.

131

Tua-i-llu tang tuaten pimalriit aulukumalriit mikqapigteng’e’rmeng aulukut’seng elisngalaraat
Then, you see, those who are taken care of like that know how they are taken care of though they are very small

132
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,835
Ayagmek elpengqelaameng mikelnguyagaunge’rmeng.
Because they’re conscious form the start though they’re small children.

133

Yagiraluki wall’u qanpagalluki anglicaasqevkenaki.
They said not to raise your hand against them or shout at them when you raise them.

Tan’gaurluut arcaqerluki qanpagalluki pisqumanrit’lallruat waten qanerluteng:
They especially said not to shout at boys, saying this:

135
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:56,323
"Pitsaqa’artevkenateng-gguq pissurnarikuneng, yuilqumi kiirrarmeng pingnatukuneng
"Should they reach the time when they start hunting, if they start to subsist by themselves in the wilderness

136
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:01,642
"Camek umyuameng alikarkaanek pitarkamek tangerquneng
"If they see an animal to hunt that their minds wil be afraid of

137
00:28:01,655 --> 00:28:06,055
"Umyugailkararruteng-gguq iqlutmun qimagyuartut
"They might thoughtlessly flee the wong way

138
00:28:06,074 --> 00:28:13,349
"Wall’u umyugailkararrluteng iqlutmun tauna pitarkaq pitaqengnaqnayukluku."
"Or they may thoughtlessly try to chase that animal the wrong way."

Tamana pitekluku inerquumalallruukut qancurlagalluki, irniaput qanpagalluki, wall’ teguleraluki yagleraluki-llu anglicaasqumavkenaki.
For that reason, we were admonished against raising children by shouting at them, shouting at our children, or physically grabbing and hitting them.

140
00:28:51,836 --> 00:28:58,386
Nasaurluyagaat cali allakarmeng cali qanruyuterluteng cali anglicallrat.
There are also separate pieces of traditional wisdom for raising little girls.

141

Tua-i cali au͡g’utun ayuquq, qancurlagatevkenaki yagleravkenaki-llu.
It’s like what I just said, not to shout or raise your hand against them.

142
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:12,355
Tau͡gaam kevkaurngata-gguq, wangkuta-gguq aanaulriani kevgarkaqngamteki
But they said that because they will be helpers, since they will help those of us who are mothers

143
00:29:12,368 --> 00:29:16,668
Qanvallagavkenaki anglicararkaugaput.
We must raise them without shouting at them.

144
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:28,412
Ayagmek-llu-gguq cauryaraq man’ arnam tegulararallra tangvagceterrlainarluku, tangvagtelluku, elpekumavkarluku.
And they said that from the start, have them watch how things are done, what women do, have them be conscious of them.

145
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:35,168
Tau͡gaam arenqiatuq ernerni makuni elitnauryaramun-llu mat’umun.
But it’s detrimental in these days [that they’re] going to these schools.

146
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:44,037
Wiinga murilkurallemni, murilkurqapiarallemni, elitnauryaramun ek’aqameng ayuqucia cimiqalartuq.
In my observation, my close observation, when they go to school, their behavior changes.

147
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:49,306
Maligtaquurautellrat-llu imna ikeggliinarluni.
And they start becoming less and less obedient.

148
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,632
Kiituani ilii arturnariuq.
Eventually, some become unmanageable.

149
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:26,519
Ilii aanairteng’e’rmi wall’u elliraqerteng’e’rmi
Though some suddenly lose their mothers or become orphans

150
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:32,720
Tua-i aanami caurallra napavkalaraa, alaitevkalaraa.
They uphold what their mother did, and make it shown.

151
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:40,145
Tuaten cali elluarrluki cat pingnatugturluki, neqkat-llu uqlautenrilkurqurluki.
They even strive do to things well, and they do not let their food become dirty.

152
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:46,933
Tamana tamaa-i wangkuta qaluruyutek’lallerput, qalaruyutekerrlainallerput.
That was what we were told, what we were always told.

153
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:57,489
Arcaqerluta-llu iqulirrlainarluku cam iliini neqkaitellerkarput neqkat elluarrluki aulukeksailkumteki.
They always ended it with the important fact that we would have no food someday if we don’t take good care of food.

154
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:07,496
Neqkaitaarluki cali pivkaasqevkenaki pingnatamek ataita pingnatullrit elluarrluki aanaulriamun.
They also said not to always be without food, for subsisting fathers to take care of those who are mothers.

155
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:14,534
Elluarrluki aulukesqumarrlainarluki, neryunarivkangnaqerrlainarluki-llu.
They told them to always take good care of them, and always make them into edible food.
