Tegutullruyugnarqait tuaten atairutaqata.
I think they took them in when they lost their fathers.

Tua-i yaaruigura[raqluta]. Maa-i tang yaaruilriamek-llu tangssuunata, inugualrianek-llu tangssuunata.
We would always tell storyknife stories. Now, we don’t see anyone telling storyknife stories, and don’t see anyone playing with small dolls.

71
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,325
Caugat-mi inuguat irniaruat-llu?
What are inuguat (small dolls), and irniaruat (dolls)?

And then when the birds came, probably the jaegers, they would take out the small dolls and the dolls.

76
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:05,393
Ciin tanem?
Why so?

77
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,353
Naam. Kencikellruamegteggu-w’ ella.
I don’t know. Because they revered nature.

78
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:21,171
Niitelartua-llu manalrianek kanani Mamterillermi.
I also hear about people jiggin down in Bethel.

79
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:26,141
Cang’urluteng-gguq manarnaurtut, tua-i-llu-gguq-am catairrluteng neqet.
They say they would catch fish, then the fish would disappear.

Ilait qanlartut, "Aglenrrar-wam wall’u-qaa irnicuanerrar manaryallrullian tamaqallilriit." Tamana-qaa piciu[guq]?
Some say, "They probably disappeared because a girl within the first year of her menstruations or one who miscarried is jigging." Is that true?

81
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:37,749
Tamana piciuyugnarquq.
That’s probably true.

82
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,595

Were there others like that...

83
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:47,464
Tuaten tua-i maaten murilkua tuaten qanraqluteng inerquutnguluni.
When I observed them, I found that they would say that as an admonishment.

84
00:09:55,914 --> 00:10:14,307
Tua-ll’ ak’a tamaani Kass’at pingssiyaagpailgata atrit’lallruyugnarqut mikelnguut ayagyuat.
And then, back before there were a lot of Caucasians, I don’t think young children had names.

85
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:28,646
Niitelallruunga waten: kituucianek una aptaqamegteggu kiunauraa waten: "Uum irniaqaanga," wall’u-q’ "Uum yuliaqaanga."
I used to hear this: when they would ask him what his name was, he would answer, "I am this person’s child," or "I am this person’s adopted child."

00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:30,786
Tuaten-qaa niitelallruuten?
Did you hear about that?

87
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:38,200
Niitelallruunga. Atrit’lallruyugnarqut Kass’atun, Yugtun tau͡gaam.
I used to hear that. They probably didn’t have English names, only Yup’ik ones.

88
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:42,560
Qaillun-mi atenglallruat?
So how would they get names?

89
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:50,559
Acilallikait. Acilaqput-wa maa-i.
They probably named them. We name them now.

90
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:58,608
Nuu, tua-i-w’ iciw’ agayuvigmun agulluki angllurcelluki acilaqait?
No, you know how they bring them to the church, and baptize them with names?

Yugtarnek-wa acitullrullikai, acitukai.
They would give them Yup’ik names.

93

It was our only church when it was built.

When I grew up, I found that there was no church, but a mission house.

96
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:41,656
Tuani agayuaqluteng, qasgimi-ll’ agayuaqluteng.
They would hold services there, and hold services in the community house.

97
00:11:45,593 --> 00:11:50,615
Tua-i-ll’ naulluku ak’allaq.
And then they built the old one.

98
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,210
Tua-i kiingan agayuvikluku.
It was their only church.

99

00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:24,421
Tua-i tuvqakulluteng ilakuyusnganateng.
They shared their food with each other as if they were a single family.

Tua-i-w’ mat’um nalliini makut ayagyuat qaillun qaneryarateng Yugcetun nalluyagutengluku.
These days, these young people are started to forget how to speak their Yup’ik langauge.

102
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:45,249
Cali-llu Yuut, Yuut ak’a qanruyutait niicuirulluki.
Also, they don’t hear about traditional Yup’ik wisdom anymore.

103
00:12:47,513 --> 00:13:00,124
Apqiitnek Kass’at saagarrluteng Yuut piciqnilarait qaneryuirutellriit wall’u-qaa kinkuuciteng nalluyagulluku.
As they call it, Westernization will spread among Yupiit who don’t speak Yup’ik or who forget who they are.

104
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:14,709
Wangkuta-qaa Yugni saagartellriatun ellirciqukut cam iliini qaneryuiruskumta Yugcetun wall’u-qaa niicuiruskumta Yugtarnek ak’allarnek tamakunek?
Will we Yupiit be as if we were scattered someday if we don’t speak Yup’ik anymore, or if we don’t hear about those ancient Yup’ik things?

105
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:17,367
Pillilriakut-wa.
We probably will.

106
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:24,029
Qaneryaraq tua-i man’a tamayunaicaaquq.
We shouldn’t lose this language.

107
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,127
Ciin tanem?
Why so?

108
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:33,421
Nutem qaneryarauluni.
It’s an ancient language.

109
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:49,630
I’d kind of like to get Nicholai to say something in...
I’d kin dof like to get Nicholai to say something in...

Please ask Nicholai a question.
