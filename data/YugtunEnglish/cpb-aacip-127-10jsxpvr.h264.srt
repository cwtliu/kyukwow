96
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,900
Manaryallrani-gguq-am imkut neqet ayemqertut.
When she fished, they said that the fish “broke.”

They tell girls within the year of their first menstruations

Unkumiut atam eyakevkenaki yuvgerilata-gguq imarpigmiutaat.
But they don’t abstain from [fish] from the coast
because they said that ones from the ocean don’t have slime.
