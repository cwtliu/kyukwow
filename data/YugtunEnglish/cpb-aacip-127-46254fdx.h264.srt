But also, to those things, you know how we refer to those deep [hollows/depressions] as kanarvikneret.

If there’s a blizzard, and [the summit] up there is high, and this [depression] is deep

Apparently, the snow was weighing down on it like this.

We got out after much struggle then, and our things were wet.

When it’s airtight under the snow like this, it’s evidently very hot and hard to breathe.

That’s why they would admonish us like this:

00:05:55,785 --> 00:06:04,705
Ellaqerruskakut tuaten tua-i ilutulrianun uqitesqevkenata, qanikcautesqevkenata.
If the weather turns bad in us, we shouldn’t shelter in deep [depressions], shouldn’t let the snow cover us.

Waten cali ukiarrluku pikna, tuaten tua-i arula’artaqluku.
Also, pierce [the ceiling] up there like this, and even move it back and forth.

We will know and not be confused, and will go to our destination over there.

Waten nallungekput.
We’re starting not to know it like this.

We are ignorant these days.

That’s all for that [subject].

Then, what’s also been on my mind

55
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:44,620
Au͡gkut makut anglicartellemta ilaput nalluvkanritellruit
Those who raised us back then didn’t keep us from knowing our relatives

56
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,020
Nani nunani allani uitangraata.
Even if they’re in other villages somewhere.

57
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:59,980
Iciw’ maa-i ilu’uqniluki, angakniluki, anaanakniluki, nuliacungaqniluki
You know, these days, they’re told those people are their [male to male] cross-cousins, maternal uncles, maternal aunts, [male to female] cross-cousins

58
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,350

Those do get pointed out.

Waten-llu nunanek tekitaqameng, ukut ilakellriit tekitaqameng
And when they arrived from [other] villages like this, when these relatives arrived

62
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:42,715
Apertuatnauraitkut.
They would point out to us.

63
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,270
Wangkuta-gguq tauna-llu cakukut.
They said we and that person are related somehow.

64
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:57,420
Ilu’urqukut, wall’ usrukukut, tuaten tua-i.
We’re [male to male] cross cousins, or we’re [male to female] niece/nephew, like that.

65
00:08:57,425 --> 00:09:05,925
Tamaaggun waten nalluyuqenriqertaqluki apertuamataqameng.
Through that, we’d suddenly figure out [how we’re related] when they’re pointed out.

66
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:15,320
Tau͡gken mat’um nalliini tuaten cakuciirulluta.
These days, however, we don’t know how we’re related like that.

67
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:27,870
Maaggun-llu cakuciirutlemteggun, apertuacimanritlemteggun
And through this, not knowing how we’re related, how we’re not shown [how we’re related]

68
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,740
Mat’um nalliini nakukutengluteng yuut.
These days, people are starting to fight each other.

And yet, though they’re related like this, they’ fight. They’ve started fighting these days.

People back then were peaceful.

There was no one fighting each other.

72
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:06,665
Au͡gna ava-i waten qanengssaka pitauq.
That’s the extent of my story of that.

Mat’um nalliini maa-i waten, yaa, ayuqsugnairutukut au͡gkucicetun ciuliamcecicetun.
These days, like this, yes, we’re no longer like our ancestors of old.

Man’a waten assiriyaaquq. Assiriyaaqukut. Assirinilaryaaqekaitkut mat’um nalliini.
Now, it’s gotten better like this. We’ve gotten better. They said we’ve gotten better these days.

75
00:10:30,735 --> 00:10:38,815
Tau͡gaam assirinritukut. Wangkuta assirinritukut.
But we haven’t gotten better. We haven’t gotten better.

76
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:43,135

People back then were tight-knit.

77

We have gotten better without struggling for:

These Caucasians have provided us with our clothes, our vehicles, various things, our food, and our buildings

Nangteqenrirluta, nengelvagnanrirluteng unugmi, kiirpiurturangluta.
We stopped suffering, stopped being afflicted with great cold at night, started being hot all the time.

80
00:11:11,945 --> 00:11:15,345

It had gotten better.

81
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,240
Tau͡gaam assiirulluteng, assiirulluta mat’um nalliini.
But they’ve gotten worse, we’ve gotten worse these days.

82
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:26,715
Nakukutengluteng. Tuqurqutengluteng.
They’ve started fighting each other. They’ve started killing each other.

83
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:37,035
Qaneryaram mat’um apertullra natruartevkenaku.
It went exactly as this Bible said it would.

Those who raised us back then weren’t like this.

There weren’t a lot of accouterments in a home because their homes weren’t like this.

And when they slept at night in the extreme cold, these buckets filled with water would freeze.

And even if they were on the stove, even though those kettles had been warm, some would [end up] frozen.

Ii-i, tua-i waten... (Qaillun-mi...)
Yes, this [is it]... (So, how...)

Now, your question, ask me.

You know, how to take care of men, women.

Okay.

Now, married couples like this, this married couple

Agayulirtem tuaten aptelarak.
The priest asks them a question like that.

96
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:30,295
Agayutem ciuqerrani aptelarak waten:
In front of God, [s]he asks them this:

"In your marriage, will you respect each other, obey each other, obey your husband?

"Or, you who is a husband, obey your wife."

99

Waten maligtaquuraullutek narurtaagutevkenatek.
They must obey each other like this, not disobey each other.
