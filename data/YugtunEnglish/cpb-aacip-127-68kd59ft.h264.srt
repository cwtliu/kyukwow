Yaa, kitak’ Betty, Akiaq wani imumi iinriurteńgullruuten.
Yes, okay Betty, you were a health aide long ago in Akiak.

2
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,370
Ciuqliit iinriurtet ilakellruatgen.
You were part of the first health aides.

3
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,140
Kitak’ tamaani caliarpet ayuqellranek qanemcitqerkut.
Please tell us what your work was like back then.

4
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:04,910
Tua-i waniw’ ayagnillranek ayagniqarraallemnek ayaglua qanemciciqua qaqitenrilengraan.
Now, I will tell the story of when it started, starting from when I began, even if it’s not complete.

5
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:08,745
Ayagniqarraallruunga waten:
I first started like this:

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:17,610
Tamaani yuungcarista tekitaqan, iinriurta-llu tekitaqan
Back then, when the doctor would arrive, and the nurse would arrive

7
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:28,260
Cucuk’laatnga qanerciisqelluteng qanercirluki ayagnilallruunga.
Since they chose me to speak for them, I’d start by speaking for them.

8
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:35,625
Ayagnillruunga, ima-llu-qaa elisngalua.
I started, and I was knowledgeable.

9
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:41,985
Taringenritaqamki-llu qanellrit yugmun egmirteqatarqamki
And when I didn’t understand what they said when I was going to pass on their words to a person.

10
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:50,040
Meaning-aarit apqaurluki yuungcarista taringenritaqamku wall’u nurse-aq.
I asked them about the meaning when I didn’t understand the doctor or the nurse.

11
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,890
Taringaqamku meaning-aara Yugtun taringcuararqamku tua-i egmirtaqluku yugmun.
When I understood its meaning a little in Yup’ik, I would pass it on to a person.

12
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:11,550
Iinrunek-llu ciki’irqatki, igaulluki tua-i, ellaita igaulluki label-aarinun aperturturluki taumun yugmun cikiraqluki.
And when they gave them medicine, they would right them down, indicating them on their labels, and give it to that person.

13
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,830
Tua-i tuaten ayagnillruunga.
That’s how I started.

14
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:27,940
Waten-llu tekitarkaugaqameng yuungcaristet wall’u iinriurtet
And when the doctors or nurses planned to arrive

15
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,990
Nallunricecaurrlua.
They started letting me know.

16
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:34,475
Tua-i wii elisnganrilama
Because I wasn't knowledgeable

17
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,850
Piyuumiitelqa pissiyaagpek’naku.
I wouldn’t follow my disinclination too much.

18
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:47,335
Tau͡gaam tua-i ikayuangnaqu’urluki qanemkun uuggun.
But I would always try to help them with my speech.

19
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:56,770
Tua-i-llu tang piqerluteng wiinga elitnauristet, elitnauristet ullagluki.
Then one day, I went to the teachers.

20
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:59,625
Yuum aqvaaqanga
When a person came to get me

21
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:09,935
Atra ellirraarluku qanellra pitacirramtun arenqialliqutii igaulluku
After putting their name, I’d write down what they say their problem was as best as I could

22
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:17,615
Qavcinek-llu ernernek ayagniucia ilait qanernacialaata.
And how many days it started since some don’t say it right away.

23
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:25,945
Tua-i iinrumek-llu cali wangnek tunllerkait nalluluki.
I also didn’t know how to give them medicine by myself.

24
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:35,315
Tua-i tamakut qanrutkellrenka elitnauristem apiatallerkaa utaqaaqluku.
About those things I talked about, I’d wait for the teacher’s lunch.

25
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:42,335
Apiatarqata igaq tauna agutaqluku, tunluku elitnauristeḿun.
When they had lunch, I’d bring that writing over, and give it to the teacher.

26
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,140
Qanercuuterutaqlua. Tua-i naaqerraarluki maliklua.
He would put me on the phone. After I read them, he’d go with me.

27
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,740
Kiingan qanerrsuutet elitnaurvigmi uitaluteng tamatum nalliini.
The only phones would be in the school at that time.

28
00:03:52,745 --> 00:04:02,775
Imkut sugturpat piqarraallret elitnaurviit qamani BIA-mi piullratni.
Those first very tall ones upriver when they were BIA schools.

29
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:07,975
Tua-i elitnaurista report-araqluni yuungcaristeḿun.
The teacher would report to the doctor.

30
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:19,875
Tua-i-llu yuungcaristem yuk tauna cali qanercuutekun qalarucani igauqurluki wii tangvauralaamki.
Then when the doctor spoke to that person over the phone, he would write them down since I would watch them.

31
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:26,265
Elitnauristem igauqurluki qanellri, iinrut-llu tamakut.
The teacher would write what he said, including those medicine.

32
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:29,215
Assirinrilkan-llu cali
And if he doesn’t get better

33
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:41,260
Maavet hospital-aamun tamakut iinrut atulqellrin ikayunrilkatgu taitesqaqluku. Igauqurluki.
If the medicine he took didn’t help him, they’d say to bring him to the hospital here. I wrote these down.

34
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,190
Tua-i maligtaqulaatnga wiinga caperqenrirluki elitnauristet
Since they would obey me, I wasn’t intimidated by the teachers anymore

35
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,750
Uamtengramki nallunailngurmek.
Though it was clear I was taking up their time.

36
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:59,210
Tua-i-ll’ qanenriami iinrivigmun ayaullua taum elitnauristem.
Then when he stopped speaking, that teacher brought me to the clinic.

37
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:06,045
Alerqualua tua-i taum yuum atu’urkainek.
He would instruct me on what that person should do.

38
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:08,495
Tua-i tuaten piurluki.
I would do that with them.

39
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:14,750
Tua-i-llu nutaan 1960-mi
Then in 1960

40
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,260
Au͡gna man’a qallatelqa uum 1960-m ciukaa.
What I talked about was before 1960.

41
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:30,600
Nineteen-sixty-mi council-aat teguatnga, quyurrluteng December-aami ilaklua wiinga.
In 1960, the [tribal] council took me, meeting in December with me.

42
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,270
Tua-i-ll’ tuani
Then at that time

43
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:45,330
Qanrullua waniwa tegunilua, ikayualaasqelluki waten tekisngalriit.
They said that they’ve taken me, and to help those that arrive like this.

44
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,770
Tua-i qaill’ piviilama piyunarqekuma piciqnilua.
Since I had no choice, I said I would do it if I were able.

45
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:58,800
Tua-i tuaken nutaan 1960-mek-am cali au͡gna pellulriatun ayuqluni.
And since 1960, it was like what was before had passed.

46
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:04,545
Nineteen-sixty-mek taqevkenii, tau͡gaam elitnauristet ullagluki.
I didn’t quit in 1960, but I went to the teachers.

47
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:15,960
Tua-i-llu cat iliitni elitnaurista au͡gna, cimiraqluteng, cimiraqluteng.
Then one day, that teacher, they would be replaced, replaced.

48
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:23,000
Iliit au͡gna atra nalluyaguteksaitaqa ulla’agqa.
I went to one of them, whose name I haven’t forgotten.

49
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:28,055
Tau͡gaam aperturngaitaqa atra. Tua-i elisngaqapigtaqa.
But I won’t say their name. I know it clearly.

50
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:32,825
Ulla’agqa. Ciungani ullagaqluku.
I went to them. I’d go to them in the past.

51
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,810
Au͡gkutun tang ciuqlirmitun una pivkenani.
This one wasn’t like the others before them.

52
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,540
Qavcirqunek ullagcetqerluni qanrutaanga ullallemni
After going to them several times, they told me

53
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:52,860
Waten pianga: ellii-gguq iinriurteńguyarturluni wall’u yuungcaristeńguyarturluni tainrituq Kuigglugmun.
[S]he said this to me: [s]he didn’t come to Kwethluk to be a nurse or a doctor.

54
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:57,245
Elitnauriyarturluni-gguq taiguq.
[S]he said [s]he came to teach.

55
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,480
Tua-i-ll’ piaqa
Then I said to them

56
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:12,735
"Tua-i-wa wiinga-llu Kass’at qaneryaraat elisnganrilamku wiinga-ll’ elpeceńun ikayuryulalrianga elitnauristeńun ak’anek ciuvnek ayaglua."
"Since I do not know much about the English language, I also need you teachers’ help since way before you."

57
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:20,195
Tua-ll’ pianga, iganka-gguq naaqelarai.
Then [s]he said that [s]he reads what I write.

58
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,320
Camek-gguq ayuquciiteksaituq.
[S]he said that there was nothing confusing.

59
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:32,165
Wangnek-gguq report-alarlii imkut amkut aperturluki.
[S]he said that I should report by myself, briefing them over there.

[S]he said that I should report on the radio by myself.

61
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:50,588
Tua-ll’ piaqa, "Usuuq, wiinga tang waniwa yuurterraanemnek tailrianga ukani kingumni una erneq tekilluku.
Then I said to them, "Hey you, since I was born, I have come from all the days before me to this day.

62
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:57,751
"Ataucirquungraan radio-t button-aarat negteksaitaqa."
"Never once have I pressed the radio’s button."

63
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:08,874
"Nuu, elitnaurciqamken. Elitnaurciqamken waniwa maliklunuk taglunuk."
"No, I will teach you. I will teach you if you come with me inland."

64
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:11,523
Piaqa, "Piyukuvet."
I said, "If you want to."

65
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:16,682
Eniinek anulluku tag’ukuk apiatam nalliinguan.
I took them out of their house, and we went inland since it was lunch time.

66
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:28,927
Tua-i-ll’ itramegnuk, imkut tua-i waten pitullratni iciw’ sassaunateng, yuungcaristem ikirtellerkaa utaqaluku.
Then when we went in, when they used to do this, you know, with no clocks, we waited for the doctor to be open.

67
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:37,371
Ciumek qanelriim qanellra niitaqamegteggu kiutunganaku tamatum nalliini.
When they heard the first one speaking, I think they would then answer.

68
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:46,633
Tua-i-ll’ uum elitnauristem pianga, "Tangvakia. Tangvlagluten qanerceciiqamken."
Then this teacher said to me, "Watch me. I will watch you and have you speak."

69
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:48,622
Angraqa.
I agreed.

70
00:08:51,223 --> 00:09:01,267
Tua-i-ll’ tua-i imna qayagaurcuun pirraarluku uum qayagaurluki tua-i.
Then after making the call, [s]he called them.

00:09:02,571 --> 00:09:07,915
Qamna-llu wangnun report-aqniluku qanrutekluku.
Then [s]he said to them that it was my report.

72
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:15,050
Tua-i-ll’ aren, tangvagluku eligartenritaqa.
Then, oh my, I didn’t learn right away from watching them.

73
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:23,757
Tau͡gaam tua-i una qallatellra, negtellri nalluluki imkullrit piluki.
But what they said, I didn’t know what they pressed.

74
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:31,175
Qaqiucami pianga
When [s]he was finished, [s]he said to me

75
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:40,677
Taum-llu ima tanem iinrut alerquutekai ellirraarluki tua-i yuungcarista qanrucamiu
And after [s]he put the instructions for the medicine, when [s]he spoke to the doctor

76
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:44,766
Waniwa-gguq wangnun repeat-arcetqatarai qanellri.
[S]he said [s]he was going to have me repeat what [s]he said.

77
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:51,101
Yuungcaristem cangelkenritaa. Pisqaa. Angraa.
The doctor was fine with it. [S]he told them to do it. [S]he agreed.

78
00:09:52,790 --> 00:10:00,257
Tua-i-ll’ wangnun taicaku
Then when [s]he brought it to me

79
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:11,917
Ayaumiin umeksailan taicaku, taicamiu pianga, "Kitak’ au͡gna qanrutkesqelluku," tua-i-ll’ niicugniciqnilua.
Since it was still going and [s]he gave it to me, [s]he said to me, "Now, talk about that," then that [s]he would listen to me.

80
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:15,031
Ciuqamni uitaluni.
[S]he was in front of me.

81
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:21,899
Tua-i-llu qanellri tua-i niitniluki.
Then I said I heard what [s]he said.

82
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:29,840
Uum patient-aam alerquutai-llu iinrukai-llu niitniluki.
And I said I heard what the patient needs to do, and their medicine.

83
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:32,525
"Tua-i-qaa assirlua niitamken?"
"Did I hear you right?"

84
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:44,117
Iciw’ over-aarciiganii-llu wii. Over-aaneq nalluqapiggluku tamatum nalliini over-aatullratni.
You know, I couldn’t say "over" either. I didn’t know how to say "over" at that time when they used to say "over."

85
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:53,385
Aren, assirtuq-gguq. Assirtuq-gguq. Assirlua-gguq taringaqa.
Oh my, [s]he said it’s good. [S]he said it’s good. [S]he said I understood it well.

86
00:10:55,059 --> 00:11:05,267
Tua-i-llu taqngamku tua-i taum elitnauristem pianga
Then when I was done with it, that teacher said to me

87
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:14,479
Waniwa-gguq waken ayaglua wangnek qayagaularciqua.
[S]he said that from then on, I would call by myself.

88
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:22,122
Piaqa, "Unuaqu kiima qayagaurngaitua. Maligciiqerpenga." Maligciiqaanga-gguq.
I said, "I won’t call by myself tomorrow. You’ll go with me." [S]he said [s]he’d go with me.

89
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:32,416

Then when it was lunch time, I went to the, bringing with me that patient’s things

90
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:39,905

Because when they got me, I’d write them down as best as I could.

91
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:47,261
Tua-i-llam ulliimni pianga, "Tua-i-mtaq qanercuuteqatartuten?"
Then when I went to them, [s]he said to me, "Are you going to make the call?"

92
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,698
Angerluku tua-i.
I said yes.

93
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,350

[S]he said that I should...

94
00:11:54,407 --> 00:12:03,717

After the previous day, [s]he said that I should go inland and call the doctor.

95
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:09,414
Piaqa, "Maligglua. Elitellrunritaqa negtaallerkaq."
I said to them, "Come with me. I didn’t learn what to press."

96
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:15,133
Ellimauq-gguq. Iciw’ ellirpaumauq igarpak kanani.
[S]he said it’s on there. You know, it’s there in big letters down there.

97
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:19,484
Tua-i-ll’ maliklunuk taglunuk.
Then we went inland together.

98
00:12:19,586 --> 00:12:27,820
Tua-i-ll’ pianga itramegnuk taukut tua-i negtaarraarluki naaqesqelluki ukut.
Then [s]he said to me when we went in to press these and read these.

99
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:33,844
Man’a apertuusqelluku Kuiggluk ellimalaan.
[S]he said to indicate Kwethluk since it’s put there.

100
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:38,397
Naaqluki taukut, tangvagluki naaqluki wavet.
Reading those, I looked at and read those here.

101
00:12:39,753 --> 00:12:45,664
Ak’aniqanrituq. Tua-i pillangraata nunussiyaagpek’nani kiulua.
It wasn’t long. Though it was sudden, [s]he answered me without scolding too much.

102
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:48,361
Tua-i qanrulluku taumek.
I told them about that.

103
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:57,692
Qanruqaarluku, piurallri qanrutkurarraarluki
After telling them, after saying what [s]he said

104
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:05,220
Iinrunek tamakunek pisqelluku.
[S]he said that they should take that medicine.

105
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:11,354
Tua-i cali igaulluki tangvangraanga taum elitnauristem.
I also wrote them down though that teacher was watching me.

106
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:15,013
Taqngama tua-i taqlua.
When I was done, I was done.

107
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:27,070
Taum-am ik’iki pikilia wangnek-gguq iinrut tangerrluki amani paivcarturlaki.
[S]he told me to look at the medicine by myself over there and set them out.

108

Taukut tau͡gken qanercuutet pamani elitnaurvigmi.
However, the phone was inland at the school.

110
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:45,613
Atam waten nalluluni arenqiatuq.
You see, it’s distressing when one doesn’t know like this.

[S]he gave me keys for [the school] up there, and the clinic’s keys.

117

Even if I didn’t go to them when the school is locked, [s]he told me to open it, go in, and use the communication device.

When I started training, I would try to do what I had done like that.

It would open at 10:00, until when would it go? I think it would be until 5:00 back when we started.

We wouldn’t have lunch because the teacher sent students to us

We would go there.

And when they came in at night while we were sleeping and woke us up, and I wasn’t the only one.

"But I passed the doctor’s and nurse’s message, passed it on in my hard work that wasn’t my choice."

That’s what I did. I started back then without knowing how to take are of medicine.
