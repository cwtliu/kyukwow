Imumi ellangellerpeni manalallrata ak’aqucuk Kass’at manassuutait pivailgata
Back when you were growing up when they fished long ago before Western fishing rods appeared

20
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:34,995
Canek atulallruat Kass’artarnek kuvyassuutnek pivkenateng, wall’u-q’ manassuutet iciw’ au͡gkut?
What did they use instead of Western gill nets or those fishing rods?

Tamaani tanglallruunga mananek Kass’artarnek tangerpek’nii tau͡gaam pilianek, ussukcarrarnek-llu waten kukeggluteng.
Back then, I used to see non-Western fishing lines with hoods, and they had little nails fastened to the heads.

22
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:50,425
Ilait tua-i uivvaaryulriit anagiyugaqluteng.
Some that spun would let the fish escape.

Little pieces of ivory, and, you know, caribou antlers, I used to see tham used for fishing hooks.

Makut-llu tua-i luuskaat, ilaita luuskaat manaliaqluki epuit amilicarluki kukekluki.
And they would make fishing hoods out of spoons, some spoons, by shaving down their handles to use as fastening on the heads.

25
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,260
Tamakunek tua-i kic’ugngalrianek manaruaraqluteng.
They made old-fashoined fish hooks out of those things that could sink.

26
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,260
Ukaqvaggun maa-i manat pingellrulriit.
Fishing lines and hooks came recently.

27
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:32,165
Canek ellangurallerpeni tanglallrusit wall’u-q’ niitelallrusit?
What did you see or hear about in your early childhood?

Tua-i-w’ au͡gkut, au͡gkut tua-i wiinga angullrunritanka iciw’ nangteqeqapiggluteng yuulriit.
Well, I wasn’t born in time to see those who lived extremely hard lives back then.

Waten Kass’artarluki-ll’ murilkellruunga. Maani-llu ellangua Kass’artarluni, Kass’arluta au͡g’umek Kass’all’e’rmek piaqluku.
And I observed a time with Caucasians like this. And I grew up here with Caucasians, with one among us whom we called Kass’all’er.

30
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,520
Taumek tua-i. Maani-ll’ call’ qavani Kass’artarluni.
That was him. There were also Caucasians upriver.

31
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:04,955
Tau͡gaam tamakut-wa tua-i pingraata
But even though that’s the case

I want to talk about our traditional wisdom about how people should live well like this.

Cali-llu cat assiinaku waten qaneryaramek niicuitellermeggni, agayulrianek-llu niicuitellermeggni
But bad things, when they didn’t hear about the Bible like this, or about religions

34

Qanruyutellrit wangnun wall’u niitellrenka, tamakut maa-i ilait eneqakumalaryaaqanka.
I recall now some of the traditional wisdom they passed down to me or that I heard.

00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:39,615
Tau͡gaam qanrutku’rciiganaki, tau͡gaam piyunarqelriamun qanrutkaqluki.
But I can’t always speak about them, only to those who are willing.

36
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:48,135
Iciw’-llu elpeceńun arcaqerluci qanrut’laryaaqamci assirluci yuullerkarpeceńek.
And, you know, I tell especially you guys how you should live well.

Yuum waten qanruyutni tau͡gaam maliggluki yuulriim elluarrluni yuutuuq, yuutulliniuq.
Only a person who adheres to the traditional wisdom passed down to him like this lives a good life.

38

Tau͡gken waten qanruyutni maligtenrilkii tua-i unguvaqacuaqerluni, wall’ qanruyutni atuqii unguvamaqerluni.
However, he who does not adhere to the traditional wisdom passed down to him lives a short life, or he who adheres to them lives a longer life.

39
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:22,105
Waten au͡gkut qantullruluteng: "Yuk-gguq qanruyutminun maligtaqulluni erenra aipirluku unguvatuuq.
They used to say this long ago: "A person who adheres to the traditional wisdom passed down to him lives to see another day.

40
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:29,585
"Tau͡gken-gguq qanruyutminek narurciluni yuulria erenrem iquani unguvalriatun ayuqluni."
"However, he who disobeys traditional wisdom only lives until the end of the day."

41
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:42,210
Maa-i-llu mat’um nalliini makut wani ayagyuat, elpeci tua-i ayagyuani-llu allaurtuci avanicetun tanglallemcetun.
And young people these days, you young people have become different from what we used to see back then.

42

Wiinga-llu tua-i waten assiileng’e’rma qanruyutenka nalluvkenaki umyuaqetuluki pillruunga.
And even though I am bad like this, I knew and remembered the traditional wisdom passed down to me.

43
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,140
Maa-i-llu mat’um nalliini yuut allayuurrluteng.
And these days, people have become very different.

Tuar tang ellalegtairulluni, wall’u canek tua-i murilkiyuilnguurtellriatun ayuqluteng.
It seems there’s no more sensible people, or they’ve become unobservant of anything.

45
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,130
Tuar-llu cikmirmun ayalriacetun maa-i mat’um nalliini ayuqliulluteng.
And it seems they are starting to live as blind people these days.

46
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:23,535
Waten-llu qanruyutmeggnek, qanruyutnek-wa makuni-llu maa-i KYUK-ni wiinga amllerqunek qanruyutnek waten niitelaryaaqua niicugniurayuileng’e’rma.
And the traditional wisdom, I do hear about traditional wisdom through KYUK here as well even though I don’t always listen in.

Tau͡gaam tamakut tuar tang amllerem tayima-llu niicuitelaqai. Waten ayagyuani arcaqerluki niicuitelarngat’laqait.
But it seems many do not hear them. It seems that young people especially do not hear about them.

48
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:49,540
Maa-i makut waten yuum elluarrluki wall’u angayuqaagminek, angayuqaagni niiculukek yuullerkaa, tamana-llu maa-i niiqurayuirulluku.
And now, they don’t hear about how to live well or to treat their parents wells, living in obedience to their parents.

49
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,500
Agayuvigni tau͡gaam niitaqluta qanruyutnek.
We only hear about wisdom in church.

50
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:02,370

That’s why we who have reached this age that must teach our grandchildren or our children

Makunek maa-i niitellemteńek wall’u wangkutnun qanruyutellemteńek tua-i qanrutaqluki pinaqsaaqaput.
We must talk to them about these things we’ve heard or the traditional wisdom passed down to us.

52

Atam nasaurluq arcaqerluni waten qanruyutengqellruuq, tan’gaurluq-llu cali allakarmi qanruyutengqerrluni.
You see, girls especially had traditional wisdom concerning them, and boys had separate wisdom concerning them.

53
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,870
Nasaurluq waten alerquutengqellruluni
A girl had this instruction

54
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:41,520
Waten tan’guarlurmun arnamun piksailngurmun tamakunun tua-i-wa mulngakluku yuullerkaa
To keep boys who had not had women living carefully

55
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,380
Waten qanrumiimi: "Arnaq-gguq tuquuguq."
Because it says this: "A woman leads to death."

56
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:57,750
Wiinga-llu tamana tua-i ayagyuallemni aliketulqa waten, waten tuquuralrianek tangyuitellemteńi alikellruamteki
I also used to fear this when I was young, people we feared it when we didn’t see many people dying

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,750
Wiinga-llu alikellruamki waten tangerrsaqliraqam.
And I feared them when I saw death since a long time.

58
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,500
Taumek tuaten pituyukluki alikellrukeka.
I feared it since I thought that would happen.

Waten tan’gaurlurmun aipangeksailnguq wall’ nasaurluq aipangeksailnguq, tamakunun mulngakutesqellruuq, mulngakutesqellruat.
They told them to be careful with unmarried boys or unmarried girls.

60
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,800
Tua-i-gguq nasaurluum tan’gaurluq tuqutarkaugaa.
They said that a girl would bring death upon a boy.

61
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,200
Tua-i-llu ilii maa-i nallunailngurmek tuaten ayuqaqluni.
And some now are certainly like that.

62
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:41,930
Maa-i makut qanruyutektulput. Arcaqerluta-llu waten atailngurmek mikelngurmek alairisqevkenata.
These were the traditional wisdom passed down to us. They also especially told us not to bear illegitimate children.

63
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,110
Kasngunarqepiallruuq tamana wangkutnun.
That was very shameful to us.

64
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,830
Maa-i-llu mat’um nalliini tua-i caunrirluni kasngunairulluni.
And these days, it’s become irrelevant and without shame.

65
00:07:51,950 --> 00:08:03,190
Cat-wa tua-i qaneryarami-llu waten qanrutkumiimi: "Cat-gguq tamarmeng kasngunairutarkauguq." Ella man’a waten allayuurtellria maa-i.
It’s also because it says this in the Bible: "Nothing will become shameful anymore." The world has changed like this now.

66
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,420
Taumek murilkeńarqaakut.
That’s why we must be careful.

67
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:13,080
Arcaqerluku-llu cali tan’gaurluq elliinek murilkesqaa, murilkesqellruat.
They escpecially told boys to be careful with themselves.

Waten arnamun pivailgan nasaurlurmun pisqevkenaku. Nasaurluq tuaten ayuqelria ingluliuresqellrunritaat.
Before he had a woman, they told him not to be around girls. They told them not to be with girls like that.

69

Tua-i-gguq tan’gaurlurmek tuquciarkaungami waten tuqulluku pinrilng’e’rmi.
They said that she would lead a boy to death even if she doesn’t actively murder him.

70
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:39,430
Tau͡gaam avani-llu yaaqvaarni tauna tan’gaurluq imumi tamaani elluatuuyuitellrulliniuq.
But even a very long time ago, a boy would not be perfect.

71
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:44,110
Wagg’uq nulirruarluteng nasaurluut-llu uinguarluteng.
They called it "pretending to have wives," and girls "pretending to have husbands."

72
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,440
Maa-i tamakulrianek tangyuirutukut watuam nalliini.
We don’t see anyone doing that these days.

73
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,990
Tau͡gaam avani tamakunek niitetullruunga.
But I used to hear about them back then.

74
00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:03,790
Taumek tamakut, tamakut tamaani yuulriit arcaqerluki waten yut’eng inerqutullrulliniit.
That’s why the people who lived back then especially admonished their people like this.

75
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:14,210
Waten-llu cali niitetullruunga: "Yuum-gguq iliin irniani tangvauralriatun anglaniuralriatun ayuqai."
I also used to hear this: "Some people look at having children is all fun."

76
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,830
Tamana-llu wii maa-i eneqak’la’rqa makunek.
I also remember that with this people.

77
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,830
Waten-llu tua-i natmun pivigkailamta agayuya’arqamta
And because we don’t have anywhere else to go like this when we go to church

78
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:38,200
Tua-i waten irniani tayima unilluki kiirrarmi waten yuk piaqan tamana-llu wiinga eneqak’la’rqa qanruyutelleq.
When they leave their children behind and they are alone like this, I remember that old piece of traditional wisdom.

79
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:49,420
Yuum-gguq iliin irniani anglaniuralriatun ayuqai waten qanrucuunaki, camek-llu aarnarqelriamek pingraata qanrucuunaki.
They say that some people act like having children is all fun without teaching them, and do not say anything even when they do dangerous things.

80
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,850
Tau͡gaam qanrutnarqaput.
But we must talk to them.

81
00:09:53,090 --> 00:10:05,790
Wiinga-llu tua-i ukut qanrutarkanka tayima-llu ilaita niicuumiilngalengraatnga tua-i makut nallunrita’arqenka qanrutkelaryaaqanka wall’u allanun.
I also speak to those whom I must teach about what I know, even if some of them don’t seem to want to listen, or to other children.

82
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,820
Makut maa-i yuum elluarrluni tau͡gaam yuullerkai.
These are the things that are only to help people live well.

Waten qanengssaarnek-llu niitengramta, tua-i niitelaryaaqua-llu wii, tau͡gaam makut maa-i qaneryarat yuum elluarrluki yuullerkai tua-i qanruteknarqaput
Even though we hear gossip like this, I also hear some too, but we must talk about the traditional wisdom that helps people live good lives

84
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,070
Makunun kingumta yuitnun.
To the people of our descendants.

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:36,260
Tayima piinanermeggni eneqalarait, eneqalaryaaqelliit waten elluarrluni yuullerkaq.
They probably remember how to live good lives as they go.

86
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,040
Maa-i-llu mat’umi nutaan nugtarrluni tuarpiaq makut qanruyutet.
And now, it truly seems that the traditional wisdom has moved.

87
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:48,820
Niiculuni yuulria cam iliiniku-llu nunakegtaarmi uitaarkauniluku.
It’s said that obedient people will someday live in paradise.

88
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,710
Maa-i makut piyuumirnarqelriit.
These are desirable.

89
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,440
Tua-i carraungraan waten qanertua.
Even though it’s not a lot, I’ve said this.

90
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,840
Yaa, tua-i-qaa?
Okay, is that all?

91
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,690
Ii-i, tua-i waniw’ man’a qanqautekaqa.
Yes, I’ve spoken about this.

92
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,400

Can you speak on one more thing? (Yes.)

93
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,020
Maa-i iciw’, atanema-am pillruanga unuamek niiquralalriakut
Now, you know, my superior told me about what we hear about today

Mikelnguut akniringqaluteng taqnernun, wall’ ilait taqnernun iciw’ nangcimaluteng, akusrarcimaluteng, wall’ camaluteng.
About how children are hurt by adults, or, you know, some are beaten, molested, or other things by adults.

95
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:36,410
Imumi-qaa elpet ayagyuarullerpeni mikelnguut akusraritektullret wall’ akniringqalriit tanglallruuten-qaa?
Back when you were young, did you see children being molested or hurt?

96

Tangyuitellruunga tamakunek, tamakunek-llu akusrarutekumalrianek.
I never saw those, or those who were molested.

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:56,420
Tua-i waniw’ tamaani ayagyuallemni tuar tang tua-i niigartellrunrilngua tamakunek akusrarutekumalrianek wall’u nangcimalrianek.
Back when I was young, it seems that I never heard about those who were molested or beaten.

98
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:01,670
Yuut tua-i tamaani wat’um nalliinicetun ayuqenricaaqut.
People back then were not like now.

99
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,580
Waten-llu ilait wiinga tanglallruunga marayanek-llu eneluteng.
I also used to see some with sod houses like this.

100
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,030
Enaita-llu iluat waten aklurugartaunani, cataunani
And in their houses, they didn’t have a lot of things, almost nothing

101
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,440
Makut tau͡gaam waten-ll’ inartessuutait, cait tua-i carrait.
Except for bedding like this, what little they had.

102
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:32,300
Tuaten nangcimalriamek arcaqerlua-llu niiteksailnganii tuaten tua-i nangteqluteng yuut yuuyaaqengraata
I don’t think I heard of anything, especially about children abused like that, even though people lived hard lives.

103
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,910
Tau͡gaam eq’ukluki, caluki, nanglluki, tamakunek niicuitua.
But I didn’t hear about them mistreating them, doing bad things to them, or beating them.

104
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:52,510
Maa-i tau͡gaam ukaqvaggun, tuar tang wangni ukaqvaqapigkun tamakunek-llu niitelangelrianga akusrarutekumalrianek nangcimalrianek-llu.
It’s that only recently, only very recently to me, I’ve started hearing about those who are molested and beaten.

105
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:06,200
Imumicetun maa-i mikelnguut ayuqenrilriit maa-i ak’a imumi unuamek-llu.
Children are no longer how they were like long ago, long ago compared to today.

106
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:14,390
Ii-i, maa-i iciw’ ava-i qanelrianga mat’um nalliini makut tua-i yuut cimilriit.
Yes, you know, I’ve just said that people these days have changed.

107
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:22,760
Mikelnguut-llu cali maa-i mat’um nalliini tua-i-am cimirluteng, cimiumaluteng.
The children these days have also changed.

108
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:29,650
Waten avani mikelngurnek waten ayuqelrianek tangyuitellruunga.
I never used to see children like this back then.

109
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:40,580
Taumek waten mikelnguq, wangkuta-w’ tua-i Yuungamta, waten-llu kina Kass’atun pingnaq’nge’rmi yuuluni pingaituq.
That’s why a child will not live like these because we are Yup’ik, and even if they are trying to live a Western life.

110
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:47,120
Taumek irniarit waten Yugcetun tau͡gaam qanruqu’urluki.
That’s why they should speak to their children only in Yup’ik.

111
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Wangkuta imumi, wiinga-wa ukut wani irnianka nallumiima, qitevvneq-llu nalluamku
A long time ago, because we, at least I, didn’t know Western things and since I don’t know English

112
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:03,510
Waten Yugcetun tamamta maani, qagkut-llu tayima irniateng waten Yugtun qalaruquratullruit.
All of us here, and probably those up north, would only speak to their children in Yup’ik.

113
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,750
Taumek maa-i mat’um nalliini tamana umyuaqela’arqa.
That’s why I remember that these days.

114
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:23,260
Tayima mikelnguum Kass’aturrlainaq waten elilluni anglilriim qanruyun inerquqaun-llu taringesciigalia mat’um nalliini.
That’s why a child who learn only in English cannot understand traditional wisdom and admonishments anymore these days.

115
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,920
Taumek maa-i arcaqerluteng yuut cimilriit mikelnguunge’rmeng-llu.
That’s why people, including children, have changed especially today.

116
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,030
Yaa, tua-i waniw’ amllerilria.
Yes, that’s enough now.

117
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,520
Tua-i? Oh, yaa.
Is that all? Oh, yes.

118
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,180
Waten-llu [?]sqellruatnga
They also asked me to [?] like this

119
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:57,230
Iciw’ imumi yuullevet, aren...
You know, your life back then, I mean...

120
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:09,050
Iciw’ anglanarqellrianek-gguq-qaa tangqerraallerpeceńi tengssuutnek wall’u-q’ canek tamakunek...
You know, they asked for funny stories from when you first saw planes or those kinds of things...

121
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:18,940
Irr’ikpiatullruaput, ii-i, tengssuutet waten amllenritellratni, tau͡gaam kiani tengssutetarluni.
We used to be amazed by them, yes, when there weren’t many planes, but there were planes upriver.

122
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:27,600
Arcaqerlun’ tua-i imna Taqay’aq tamaani tamatum nalliini tengautullruuq avani tayim’ Nangllermi.
Back then at that time, Taqay’aq was the most prominent pilot over in Nanglleq.

123
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:38,110
Tua-i tamana tengssuun agiirtaqan, wangkuta-ll’ qaill’ angtaceta, tua-i ukut-llu nunat iciw’ yugyallrunritut; carraullruukut.
When that plane approached, I’m not sure how big we were, and this village, you know, wasn’t heavily populated; there were few of us.

124
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:51,030
Tua-llu-w’ tua-i wangkuta tayima mikelngull’e’rni pilallilriakut, tamqapiaramta tua-i atraqerrluta maavet ekviim qainganun tauna tengssuun anglanilallrukput
And then, it was probably we children, every single one of us would go down here to the bluff and have fun watching that plane.

125
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:55,100
Makut-llu call’ taqnerunge’rmeng irr’iluteng.
Even these adults would be amazed.

126
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:01,140
Qaillun-llu tenglauciit irr’ikluki tengssuutet pitullriit.
They also used to be amazed wondering how planes flew.

127
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,690
Tua-i cakneq imkuluki, wangkuta-ll’ anglaniaqluta.
They had a lot of, you know, fun, including us.

128
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,440
Tauna tua-i arcaqerluni Taqay’aq maavet taitullruuq.
Taqay’aq was the main one who came here.

129
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,620
Wii tua-i tamaani tangerqarraalarngatellruaqa tauna tengssuun.
I think that was the first time that I saw that plane at the time.

130
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:26,610
Yaa, kitak-wa tua-i ilakailkuvgu...
Okay, now if you don’t have anything else to add...

131
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,140
Canek? (Yugpagnek.)
About what? (Giants.)

132
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,490
Yugpagnek tamakunek wii nalluunga.
I don’t know about those giants.

133
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,720
Tau͡gaam niitetuyaaqekenka-llu. Mat’um nalliini nalluyagulluki tamakut pianka.
But I also heard about them. I’ve forgotten about them now.

134
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,890
Tua-i wiinga-llu...
I also...

135
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:51,170
Tau͡gaam tua-i ava-i au͡gkut umyuama tua-i arcaqakelaryaaqekai waten qanruyutet yuum elluarrluki tau͡gaam yuulerkait.
But in my mind, I think these pieces of traditional wisdom about how people should live well are important.

136
00:16:51,480 --> 00:17:01,360
Waten-llu ca-w’ tua-i tamarmi iciw’ tua-i makuggnaqluni tayima piyaaqelria.
And everything, you know, required hard work like this.

137
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:13,720
Tau͡gaam man’a-llu yuucirrarput cali tuarpiaq makuggnaqluni. Tayima waten assilria atungnaqesteḿini makuggnarqelriatun ayuqeciqsaaqelliuq.
But our short lives seem to require hard work. It seems that it requires hard work to those who try to do good.

138
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:25,390
Tau͡gaam akiliutii, yuum assirluni pillrem akiliutii angtuaruuq, yuum waten assirluni ayallerkaa.
But the reward, the reward for a person who does good is great, how a person should live well.

139
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:35,700
Maa-i mat’um nalliini ava-i aptellerpetun yuut taqnerunge’rmeng-llu tuarpiaq ayuquciit cimilriit
These days, as you just asked, even adults seem to have changed.

140
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:44,670
Arcaqerluku mat’um akusrarutiita tua-i maa-i cimircetlikai, cimircetai
Their mischievous ways have especially caused them to change

141
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,680
Cat tayima akusrarrnarqelriit.
These mischievous ways.

142
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:56,860
Agumalluku, waten tamatum agumatestii tua-i elluarrluni yuuyuunani.
Those who go after them do not live well.

143
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,050
Waten-llu ilaminek ayuqniarluni tuarpiaq yuurrluni maa-i mat’um nalliini.
It seems that they are born envying those around them these days.

144
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,670
Tamatum akusrartellran allurrluku, tuar allurrluku.
It seems his mischievous ways deprive him of that.

145
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,410
Assirluni waten makutun calriatun pivkenani.
He is not like those who do well.

146
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,810
Taumek tamakut cat atuyunaicaaqai.
That’s why he should not do those things.

147
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:33,280
Maa-i nallunrirluki waten inerquutnguciit wall’ iquggliquciit nallunrirluki kia tua-i imum atunrilkuniki ellminek ikayurarkauguq.
If a person learns what is admonished against or what brings misfortune and does not do them, he will help himself.

148
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,300
Yaa, kitak-wa tua-i. Quyana.
Okay, that’s it. Thank you.
