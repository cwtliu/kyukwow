I don’t know. It’s probably their minds
when they have the idea to do that.

81

Tayima-llu-wa aipaagni angayuqaita, aanaita, ataita-llu

mothers, and fathers do not teach them anymore.

82
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500

Probably.

Tua-i-w’ qanruyuteteng niisngassiyaagpek’naki

Some of the young people from here probably do not
understand Yup’ik anymore.

95
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,800
Qitevqurayaangameng-wa.
Because the little ones now always speak English.

96

Nauwa ciuqlirmi Yugcetun, qitevvneq nallullrukiit

Consider that [they spoke] Yup’ik before, not knowing English

Tua-ll’ imkut qavaken qau͡gkumiullret Yugcetun,

And then the people from upriver do not speak Yup’ik too much
because they’re Upper Kuskokwim Athabascans.

98

Tau͡gaam Kass’acetun qallateng’e’rmeng,

Yugcetun cagmayunaituq qanelput.
Our Yup’ik language should not be lost.

101
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Kass’acetun-llu aukluku Yugcetun mumiggluku Kass’at qanellrat
Couple it with English, translating what is said in English into Yup’ik

Tamakut tuaten apqaulaitkut mumigtesqelluki,

Because they ask us to translate like that, and these Caucasians
who aren’t Yup’ik like us ask for translations.

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yuut-llu ilait qanerceciisqaqluteng Kass’anun.
And some Yupiit ask for others to speak to Caucasians for them.

They said that when these churches first came, they ended up
reading these written Qaneryarat, what they call the Bible.

106
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,400
Naaqait-gguq taringyaurrluki-llu-gguq.
They said they read and started understanding them.

They realized that they were not different from the old
