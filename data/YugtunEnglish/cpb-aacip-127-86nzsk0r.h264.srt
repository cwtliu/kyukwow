Let’s speak.

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,410
Ii-i, tua-i imumi cumigyagutellemni-ll’ wiinga
Well, a long time ago, when I became observant

When we were growing up, we realized that we would hear about what my spouse talked about when we were growing up.

00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:25,315
Tau͡gaam tang tua-i wangkutni ayagyuani tua-i alingnaqluteng tamakut Kass’aqarraat.
But for us young people, those first Caucasians were scary.

Qavcin tua-i Kass’at tangerqalaqeput.
We would see several Caucasians.

We didn’t always see them. Only once in a blue moon, we would see Caucasians who arrived.

Tamakut tamaa-i. Tua-i-ll’ piqerluteng maani Anuuraami uitaluta elitnaurvingluteng maani.
There you have it. Then one day, we were here in Anuuraaq when they built a school here.

Then we tried to go to school, oh my, our parents were very reluctant to let us go.

Angurrluk’ elitnauryaasqevkenata.
They told us not to go to school under any circumstances.

Tamakut camek tua-i akusrarrnarqelriamek ayagnirniluki. Maa-i tua-i ungacautnguniluki tamakut elitnaurviit.
They said that those were starting some kind of unacceptable behavior. They said those schools [?made them soft].

12
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,690
Alingnaqkacagarluteng tua-i tuani pillemteńi.
They were very scary when we did it then.

Though they admonished us, and after I had gone to school, after I had checked them once...

14
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,040
Wait, tauna igtuq.
Wait, that fell.

15
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,520
Aipaqlian?
Are you a couple?

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,860
Qastussiyaallemta pillia?
Was it because we were too loud?

17
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:41,065
Nuu.
No.

18
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:49,860

Then after we had gone to school, we went home since they told us to stay.

They said that they would become foolish far in the future, not thinking about what they should be doing when they start bringing things that cause mischief.

We didn’t go to school, but our poor young people and our children are starting to go to school.

The Caucasians have done that, and they didn’t seem to physically abuse any Caucasians.

And this, among their many pieces of traditional wisdom, among those who wanted to speak to us, they say that jealousy is part of traditional wisdom.

28

Yuk-gguq elluarrluni-llu yuungnaqu’urlulria ciknakluku imna angalkum ciknatarlim
They say that a jealous shaman would be jealous of a person who is living a good life

They place curses on them to make them bad hunters, or they destroy the riches of one who had been going to live well.

Umyuarrliqluteng tamakut cakneq.
Those have great malicious intent.

They said that though they despise us among our peers, and they say that we poor young people, girls here, are lazy

But those who taught us well would tell us that.

When they got up, they would always tell us, "When you young people have children too

"Irniarci-gguq mikelnguungalnge’rmi, wall’ pilukuvceńi camek inerququvciu, ’Kitak’ at’ ilavet piqaqatgen qimagaqluki ingluliuteng.’"
"Even though your child seems like a child, or if you admonish them when you put on their skin boots, ’Now, if your peers do anything to you, run away [?].’"

40
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,030
Atam-gguq cumikeyagatuut.
They say that they pay attention.

They say that what these elders of ours heard when they were growing up are theirs.

Maa-i tua-i tamana umyuaqaqamku qunukelalqa-llu tamana akusrangciqniluki avani
When I remember that now, what I didn’t want, that they would become mischievous in the future

Qitevcuilama-llu qitevtellrit-llu niicuilamki umyuaqluki.
And since I don’t speak English and don’t hear them speaking English, I remember them.

Irniangamegnuk-ll’ aipangamegnuk, aipaput kenekluki pisqessaaqaqluki.
And when we had children and got married, they told us to love our spouses.

We should pay attention to our husbands, and never be unfaithful.

And if we women go to [other men] without our husbands’ knowledge

Back when we were growing up, we realized that when they spoke to us, they would tell us of unacceptable things [?] them.

Tangvagluta-ll’ piaqatkut waten umyuarteqsaaqnaurtukut wangkuta niicugnilriani:
And when they did that watching us, we who were listening would think this:

50
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:18,080
"Aling ik’um-am cunaw’ nallunrilkiikut. Tangellrukiikut." Tuar tang nallunritkacagarluta ilumun tangellruluta pilaqaitkut.
"Oh my, that person apparently knows us. (S)he saw us." It seemed that they knew us very well, like they had truly seen us.

Cunaw’ tamakut qanruciyupialriit ircaqurteng cairluku ellait atullmeggnek assirluki yuk agesqelluku qanruturlularyaaqellinikaitkut.
It turned out that those who really wanted to speak to us emptied their hearts of what they had experiences, telling us so that a person would do well.

Irniau͡rluput-llu waten makut irniaqsagutaqamteki angurrluk’ tua-i agutevkenaki
And our poor children, when we have children, they said never to bring them [to others’ houses]

Atam-gguq asriurturlurniartut.
They said they’d become mischievous.

They said that their unacceptable behavior would exacerbate our poverty.

A mother who looks after the house, and the father who travels for what we need

Tamakut tamaa-i anglatekevkenaki-gguq.
They said not to treat those lightly.

We should not take his heard earned money and go.

Cunaw’ imna anguyagteńun ayagangaqameng tan’gaurlurugaungameng-ll’ irniapuk tua-i umyuaq una navgurluku yuungaqluta mer’ayullermegteggun maaggun.
it turned out that when they start going into military service, since we have a lot of male children, we start living destroying our mental health because they abuse alcohol.

67
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:26,280
Tua-i tuaten tau͡gaam ilalqerpek’nani yuk yuurluqili mat’um nalliini.
However, may a person live life without exacerbating things like that in these days.

Stop paying attention to those who teach and instruct us, telling us to live well without hindering those among us

So, they said, that our house would be peaceful.

And if some guest who feels helpless comes in, try to make them feel at east, if we, you know, do not live mischievously.

We missed our desire to be good.

And these days, since these young people, our descendants, are now in great need of teachers these days because there’s not a lot of people

Tamakut-llu tamaa-i arnat uingit tuar caunrilkellermegteggun ciisqurrilitaqluki tamaaggun
And those women, it seems that through their disregard for their husbands, they’re like knee guards through that

Ayuqenrilngurnek-llu irniangeksaunata, uirlurput-wa una nakmiillarput.
And we didn’t have different children [from different men], with our very own husband here.

Aipamta-gguq tau͡gaam tamakunek irniarinek irniarluta, canek allatarnek ilayuunaki.
They said that we only had children from our spouse, without adding any from others.

83

Tangniqpiarluteng-gguq.
They said they were beautiful.

84
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:43,064

And it was very scary to become pregnant at a young age, to bring forth a child.

Atailnguut tallurnaqkacagarluteng-gguq. Inerquutngullruyaaqluni.
They said illegitimate are embarrassing. It was an admonishment.

Apprently, this was the mischief that our elders back then would talk about.

When we watch things on TV, when they inject people who are rowdy, including women, they would become very abnormal.
