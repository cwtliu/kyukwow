The ones who were hard to talk to were talked to but when they didn't use their advice they would say this about them.

Yuulallruut tamakut qanruyutem artuqai. Tamakut ellmegnek maligtaqutenrilnguut qanruyutmeggnun.
That's how they were with their advice they didn't heed.  Those who didn't listen on their own of given advice.

They didn't live long.  See,truly it's very correct what they use to tell us.  They didn't live long.  They didn't live long.  They would be sickly and suddenly they're gone.

25
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:59,766

However, those who heed and follow their advice go through it slowly or so it seems.  Slowly or it is that way.

Tangerrluku. Tua-i waniwa tua-i. Icivaq-llam ing'um ataurlurpeci-am piicaucarturturalaraanga tekiartaqami Kangirnamun.
You see it.  Anyway, awhile back that poor father of yours prays... he comes to pray for me when he arrives in Kongignak all the time.

When he came in to pray for me he said to me gratefully, "My poor cousin, I'm grateful you're looking good and shows your mind is well. Thankful you look good."

34
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:22,966
Pila’arqa, "Tua-i niitelalqa aturluku waniwa ayuqeqcaaralarnilua. Wiinga-llu aliayulqa maliggluku yuukuma, tua-i wangnek pingaitelliniama. Imkut tau͡gaam ayagcianka nangtarkaulliniamki."
I tell him, "I use what I heard to be as I am.  If I live with my loneliness I will not do anything for myself.  I'll only hurt the ones who I leaned on for deep support.

35
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:37,466
Waten nangteqelqa maliggluku yuukuma nangtarkaulliniamki. Waniw’ tua-i waten canrilngurnun ugglua umyuameggnek utumalrianek.
If I lived in pain, I would put them in pain also.  Now I bring myself up to where the ones who have cared for themselves mentally.

I find self care on top of it.  I am how I am even though I'm where I am standing.

Tua-i-gguq, ilumun. Yuum ayuqucia tua-i ava-i maniqerniluku-am qanertuq. Yuum-gguq ayuqucia ilumun manian.
He said, "Yes, exactly. You have presented what it's like for someone to be at.  Truly you have presented a persons life.

To me he's still a youngster, that's to me.  He was just a lad, recently.  I said to him, "Look at that.

You make me recall this short saying which stays with someone who didn't misunderstand it as you say that.

Very well.  And you know you're the only one living now, in no case don't regret your loss about that, my poor cousin."  I say to him.

44
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:25,699
"Uuruteksaqunaku. Iqua tekicungkumteggu tua-i tekiskumteggu kingunrat-ggun imkut maligciiqapuk." Tua-i-am angqaurlulartuq qaill’ pivkenani.
"Don't regret your loss that might have been prevented by appropriate action."  Poor, he say's 'yes' and nothing else.

Atauciq tayima elpet paiciucukngan wangkutnun kingunerpenun ca arcaqerluku elpet paiciucukngan qanrutkeqerru.
If there's one to pass on to us who are behind you, can you tell us what you especially would pass on.

46
00:08:56,288 --> 00:09:08,083
Tua-i waniwa au͡gkut ava-i qanrutkellrenka paiciutekpigainalriatun waniwa ayuqanka.
What I have already said, I do consider that will be like true passing on.

47

Ones who don't listen lust like the ones before will be like the ones who didn't listen.  He will be like someone who doesn't listen who won't have what he needs.

48
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:46,374
Tua-i taugken imna nutaan qanrucunarqelria tua-i cali pik'a ciunrani paivngaqaaqluni. Ciunrani paivngaqaaqluni ayagpakarluni tekitaqluku.
But, then there's one who is easy to talk to who will have blessing ahead of him.  It's available in his journey as he comes across it on his many travels.

49
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:55,916
Tuaten ayuqeciquq. Asgurtanrilnguq.
That's how he will be if he does not doubt.

But those doubtful of their advice have not much of what they want,   They do experience more need and it stands out.

51
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:27,416
Cali man'a akusrarun maa-i ilaitnek yuut allurkengelriatun ayuqelartuq atu’urkaatnek.
And on using (recreational drugs) nowadays it takes away from some people what they would have provided.

52
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:40,791
Tuar atuurkarteng akusrarcullermeggnun navrutaqluku. Navrulluku tua-i atu’urkarugateng imkut akusrarcullermeggnun tun'aqluki.
Seems like they trade what they need to using, trading alot of useful items to fool around with it.

53
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:59,499
Akleng, cali maa-i akusrarculriit mat'umek apqiitnek taangamek mat'umek-llu kuingillermek, tuarpiaq tang imna tamatum imum aturyukngaata anguyakai.
Poor thing! On using of recreational drugs/mistreatment using alcohol and smoking drugs consequently its like a warfare of self because of using them.

54
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:12,124
Tua-i ellmeggnek anernerteng-llu tunelriatun ayuqaqluku tamaaggun. Tua-i pillerkaa nurr’ ukatairrluku tayim nalluyagutaqluteng.
It's like they give up their life with that.  It wasn't their time to be unaware of themselves.

Maa-i tua-i yuut ayuquciqsaguskiit man'a, man'a maa-i taangaq kuingillermek-llu mat'umek aipirluku. Umyugaitnarqelria man'a atungnaqu’urluku. Ayuqelriit tua-i anernerteng kep’laqiit tamaaggun-llu.
It's become a habit with that, this alcohol coupled with smoking drugs.  It's a foolish habit.  Their lives are cut off from that, too.

56
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:48,999
Imutun kepelriatun ayuqelaqiit. Qununaqsaaqaqluteng cakneq kingunrulriani. Qununaqsaaqaqluteng angtuamek.
It's just like cutting it.  Its something one does not wish to part with for us left behind. Big but have to part with.

57
00:11:49,944 --> 00:12:05,874
Tua-i waniw' maa-i mat'um nalliini mat'um atuqengamta nalliini yuut ayuquciqsaguskiit tamarmeng nunat yuita.
Now at this time using to us has become a lifestyle by all of the village inhabitants.

Tamarmeng ellarpiim yuan atungnaqengluku man'a maa-i wagg’uq man' taangaq.
All of the countries population...attempt to use this so called alcoholic beverage.

00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:21,958
Wangkuta call' imumi ciungatni imumi taangatullruyaqukut arulatanek.
Before them, we drank home brew.

Arulatanek taangatullruyaaqukut. Imna-llu wii aipaqa kass'anun ayaggaarluni-ll' tekitnaurtuq missuugmek uumek missuugpallermek tekiulluni papinek imalegmek.
It was our alcoholic beverage.  My husband returned from white people and he arrived with a big bag full of potatoes.

61
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:53,833
Una-w’, ukugnek-llu cali missuugegnek malrugnek saarralarpallraagnek imkugnek tekiutnaurtuq. Aipaa tuavet atuugarkauluni papinun.
And he also came with two big bags of sugar and one of them was to be used in the potatoes.

62
00:12:55,146 --> 00:13:06,958
Aren, wiinga-llu ciunrani wani kenirraarluki papit passiluki. Passirraarluki puckar’ au͡g’ imi’irqamku
And me, there ready for his coming cooked and mashed those potatoes and after mashing when I filled the barrel...

63
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:18,666
tua-i tuaten tua-i ayuqucirkaat nallunrirluku. Yuurqaaraat imkut umyuaqurluki imiraqluku puckaq imna.
just like that I learned the process. I filled that barrel thinking of the drinks in containers.

64
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:27,124
Ayivrem-llu anrutaanek patuluku. Ketrirluku tua-i cagnilluku.
I covered it with a seal intentine, tightening it with a cord.

65
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:37,416
Ketrirluku. Tua-i-ll’ piqerluni imna puckam imna patua qerruryarturluni.
It had a cord.  After awhile that cover of the barrel starts to inflate.

66
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:46,374
Qerruumaluni-ll’ erenregni malrugni. Pingayurkaagni-ll’ atraqanirluni.
It is inflated for two days and its third day it comes down a little.

67
00:13:47,300 --> 00:14:01,749
Tua-i atrarluni atraan ikirrnaurput, ikirrnaurput kit’elliinilriit imkut tayim papit. Mana-w’ painga ecuitepiaq.
So it goes down and once down we opened those potatoes had sunk to the bottom.  The top of it was very clear.

68
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:16,208
Aren, qaluuricirluku tua-i cat makut imirluki. Saaniiget-llu imirluki. Sanigpiit wall'u egatet imirluki. Patulget imirluki.
Oh, we ladled it onto containers.  We filled tea kettles.  We filled big kettles and pots.  Filled them with covers.

69
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:25,708
Kingunra-ll’ cali kan'a qalutnermek saarralirluku arulaarrluku. Ayagarrluni-llu.
The rest of it we added and mixed with a cup of sugar.  It spread quickly.

Tamana tamakut-llu imkut aturluki tua-i aturluki arenqianateng tau͡gaam tua-i tuaten tua-i waten makucetun pitaluteng piksaitelallruut.
And, so we used those and used them as it became what it was but they didn't get like these today.

71
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:52,833
Kenkutellrat cakaniutevkenani pilallruut. Equkutevkenateng. Assikluteng tau͡gaam. Assikulluteng.
Their love didn't change.  They didn't hate.  But liked one another, like that.

Tua-i arulacinanri-ll’... caqerlua tua-i kia ua cakmani nunapigmi neqliuratullruamta. Caqerlua piaqa imna Acill'aq.
So, we quit brew...one time I...we always cut fish down river on the tundra.  One time I said to that Acill'aq.

73
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:21,708
"Tua-i wii waniw’ kelengraatnga taangatulriit niisngairutua. Tua-i taqeqatartua. Amlleriuq atullra au͡g’um taangam.
"I am not going to go to my invites with drinkers.  I'm about to quit.  It's plenty that I used alcoholic drinks."

74

Tua-ll' pianga, "Taqkuma-gguq ellii-ll' taqciquq." Tua-i taqlunuk tuani qanruyullunuk.
He said to me.  "If you quit, I will quit, too."  We quit then in by telling one another.

75
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:46,541
Tua-i kelengraitkuk-llu qakemkut ilangcinanrirluki. Catuqatalriit au͡gkut Caninermiut. Tua-i
We had invitations but ignored them out there"  They were about to have it, people of Canineq.  So there

Wii tamaaken tua-i taqellruunga tua-i. Ak’aurtuq taqucilqa. Tamaani pinirpaglua yuullemni, yuullma nalliini.
I quit from that point on.  I quit long ago.  I was still very strong living at that time.

Tua-i taqelqa ak'aqucu’urtuq tayima. Tua-i taqlunuk tamamegnuk. Tua-i tamatumek tua-i taqlunuk pitateklunuk.
So, I quit a long long time ago.  We both were done with it at the same time.

I think of how fortunate after he went ahead of me how fortunate I didn't go against his order.

He said to me, "Fix my pillow over there.  I'm getting sleepy so I am going to sleep."

Just yesterday in the evening, up above he'd say, 'Jesus'.

To me that person up there is moving at such a a good speed.  He's is going above at a certain speed looking to area below.  He would look sideways turning his head.

88
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:13,333

On that moring he stopped breathing.  He layed down.  After he laid down, I sat at the end of him.  I put a blanket on him when he wanted to lay down.  He said he was sleepy and will sleep.

91
00:18:50,758 --> 00:19:07,333

I noticed his breathing was getting quiet.  He would breath in and would let it out.  His throat had no saliva whatsoever.

It seemed he was going to sleep and fell asleep.

As he made me watch him, his face was about to return to look as he was young.

The look on his face was very good.  As if he's not an old man anymore. His face was very good.  He layed there like a young person.

97
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:25,333

Also, your poor cousin he took to fix his body.  I believe they made him stay three nights in that downriver house.

On the third day it was getting close to evening, he was brought to the church.

The next day we went up and I saw, my, your cousin had returned to his youth when he had no children.

Oh that situation, we didn't know what was happening next.

He had his children sing church songs because it happened on a Sunday as it came to closing of oneself.

And, his other children were closed in on him and singing.

So, as they ended one song and stopped, he said to them, "Sing that song, Aleluia."
