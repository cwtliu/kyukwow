However, those who raised us back then that I observed didn’t have those.

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:40,500
Makut maa-i arnait cali tamakunek canegnek caqukaitnek uptetullruut.
Their women also used to prepare grass to put them in.

They would gather a lot like this.

And in the summer like this...

125
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,000
Kituriqalliniunga.
I forgot something.

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,500
Uptelallruit arnat tamakut pikameggnek tamakut can’get kelugkaitnek.
Women would prepare that grass, coarse grass, for their things.

They would be used for weaving.

even if it was a long way off

130
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,900
Camek-wa tua-i piilameng.
Because they didn’t have anything [pre-made].

Maani tau͡gaam makunek nunam qainganelngurnek aklungqellruut.
They only had what [was made from] the land.

When the need for it was approaching,
they would prepare them a long time beforehand.

Kiagmi maa-i iitaat can’get kelugkaqluki pitullruit.
They also used to use tall cottongrass from the summer for weaving.

Arnat iitartaangaqameng tamakunek
tua-i-llu nutaan saggluki waten apeqmeggnek nalacirluki.
When women started gathering those tall cottongrass,
they would spread them to dry, nalacirluki as they called it.

They wouldn’t gather them either, [but] weave them.

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,500
Tuaten pitullruit tamakut can’get kelugkait.
That’s what they used to do with grass that they used for weaving.

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Au͡gkut ava-i wangkuta mat’um nalliini-w’ tua-i umyuaqaqamki
These days, when I think about those people back then

141
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,000
Tua-i wiinga-llu tamana atullerkaa capeqsagulluku.
I’ve started becoming daunted about leading that kind of life.

142
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Tua-i-llu nutaan cali makut angutait makunek cali pissuutekameggnek
And then when the men [worked on] their tools.

They would make mink traps that looked like fish traps.

Cuqerluteng cali.
Those weren’t made haphazardly either.
They also had [set] measurements.

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,500
Makut-llu cali ilulirait waten can’giircuutetun ayuqevkenateng.
Waten pinaurtut.
Their inner compartments were not like blackfish traps either.
They would be like this.

148
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,600
And then that part over there would be like a den.

149
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,000
Tua-i-llu ingna igtetun ayuqeqerluni.
And then that part over there would be like a den.

150
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,500

Doing that to what they called the throat.

153
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Tuaten ayuqetullruut.
Piciatun pivkenateng.
That’s what they were like.
They weren’t haphazard.

Tuamtellu cali cuignilngurcuutnek cali taluyiami
And then when he made otter traps like fish traps

155
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,500
Tuamtellu igyarait waten ayuqluki au͡g’utun.
Their entrances would be like this as before.

And then he would do this, measuring it with his thumb,
determining the width like this.

157
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Tuaten.
Yaa, piciatun-am cali pivkenateng tamakut pitullrulliniut.
Like that.
Yes, they apparently didn’t make those haphazardly either.

158
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:09,000
Tua-i mat’um nalliini-w’ tua-i umyuaqaqamki au͡gkut
These days, when I think about them back then

159
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,600
Qaill’-wa tua-i yuullruciit piut.
I wonder how their lives were.

160
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,000
Umyuaqaqamki caperqetullruanka.
When I think of them, I would be daunted [by their lives].

161
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Tau͡gaam wiinga-w’ tua-i Kass’angluki pillruama
But because I [was born] when they started becoming Westernized

162
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,900
Makut maa-i aulukesteput Kass’artaatullruut
Our caretakers occasionally had Western things

163
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,500

But they didn’t get a lot.

164

Makut maa-i saayut, mukaaq, saarralaq,
caqapigtaqameng-llu sugg’alinek cali piaqluteng.
They would get tea, flour, sugar, and pilot bread once in a blue moon.

165
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Tamakut tau͡gken tua-i unakek’ngait
And yet those things that they got

166
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:15,900
Tua-i itrutaqaceteng tepsaqnaurtut tua-i cakneq.
They would smell very strong when they were brought in.

167
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Imkut-llu makut mat’um nalliini tepailnguut.
And they don’t [seem to] have any scent these days.

168
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Sugg’alit antaqaceteng yaaqsigluteng tepsaqnaurtut
narniqpiarluteng, assirluteng.
When they took out the pilot bread, they smell strong from afar,
they smelled nice and delicious.

169
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,900
Maa-i mat’um nalliini waten caciirulluki wiinga piunga.
These days, I can’t [smell] them anymore.

170
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Caqa’arqama tau͡gaam nar’aqluki tua-i canimetaqata.
Once in a while, though, I smell them when they’re close.

171
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,500
Au͡gkut ava-i tuaten ayuqellruut.
That’s what those people back then were like.

00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Qaillun-mi uksuarmi iciw’ waten ayagaqata iciw’ inerquutek’lallrit angutet?
So, how about, you know, admonishments when the men,
you know, when they traveled in the fall like this?

173
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:16,000
Tua-llu, ii-i, waten ayagaaqameng inerquutektullruit waten aarnarqellrani.
And so, yes, they used to admonish them like this
when it was dangerous as they traveled.

174
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Neplirasqevkenaki-llu cali yuilqumi pitullruit.
They also used to tell them not to make a lot of noise in the wilderness.

175
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,900
Waten neplirasqevkenaki.
They said not to make a lot of noise like this.

176
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Tau͡gaam imkut arenqiallugtellriit
Only those who get into accidents

177
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,500
Tamaa-i tamakut kiskuneng tua-i nepliraarkauluteng.
They must make noise if they have an fall into the water.

178
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Inerquutekluki-am cali tamakut waten uksuarmi yuilqumi aarasqevkenata.
They also admonished us against yelling in the wilderness
in the fall like this.

179
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Neplirasqevkenata.
They told us not to make a lot of noise.

180
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,500
Tamakut-gguq tamaa-i tau͡gaam nanikualriit tuaten nepliratullruut.
They said that only those in dire situations
would make noise like that.

181
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:16,500
Tua-i-llu neplialriamek aaralriamek niiskuneng
tua-i tauna taringarkauluku arenqiallugucia wall’u kis’ucia.
And then if they heard anyone screaming, making noise,
they would understand that [s]he’s gotten into an accident or fell into water.

182
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Tau͡gken mat’um nalliini tua-i inerquumananriameng-wa tua-i,

Yet because they are not admonished anymore these days,
they don’t know [those] anymore because we don’t admonish youpl.

183
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Waten-llu neplianaurtut.
They also make noise like this.

Aaraaqluteng tua-i maani nunat akuliitni.
They yell in between villages here.

185
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Inerquutektullruit.
They used to admonish against those.

186
00:23:51,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Tua-i-llu ataucirqumek wiinga atullruaqa tamana
arenqiallugtellria niitellemni.
And then, I’ve done that once
when I heard someone who got into an accident.

187
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Ukut, ukut nunauruyuciat Tuntutuliarmiut akaurpailgan
Before it was too long since Tuntutuliak was established as a village

When we were down in Kelliq, with people inland from us too.

Una waniwa nanvaq mat’um enem ketiini tangrran.
You see this lake toward the water from this house.

In the day nearing evening like this,
I heard someone screaming inland from us.

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,000
Qang’a-ll’ pingkuuyukanka.
I had thought it was the people inland.

192
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Cunaw’ tua-i kit’ellria kanani.
Kicaaqellinill’.
It turned out that someone fell into the water down there.
[S]he had apparently fell into the water.

193
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Qerruniaranrakun iliita atralriit tanglliniluku
One of the people going down apparently saw the person
just as [s]he was going to freeze to death

194
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Man’a waten nunataitellrani.
When there was no land here like this.

195
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Cat inerquutait au͡gkut amllellruut.
They had a lot of admonishments back then.

Waten au͡g’umek ava-i neplirasqevkenaku pitullruluki.
They used to tell them like this not to make a lot of noise.

197
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,500

And then this was especially important:

00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:35,000
Ayakata’arqameng cali qanerrlainarluteng
tamatum nuniinun ayakatarniluteng.
When they’re going to travel, they would always say
that they’re going around that area.

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Tua-i waten tekitenritaqata-llu tua-i arenqialluguciit nalluvkenaki piaqluki.
And when they didn’t return, they would know where they had accidents.

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:06,500
Tau͡gken mat’um nalliini waten ayagaaqameng

Yet these days, when they travel like this with these boats,
they don’t say anything.

201

Tua-i-llu tekitenrilameng, tekitenrilata qaill’ tua-i ayuquciinaki

And then when they don’t return, they don’t know what happened to them
because they didn’t say anything.

202
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Piciatun maa-i mat’um nalliini ayagangameng.
It’s because they’ve started traveling without consideration these days.

203
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Wall’u natetmurrnguarluteng nunanun-ll’ allanun ayagaqluteng.
Or they pretend to go somewhere then travel to other villages.

204
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:40,000
Tamaa-i tamatum maa-i mat’um nalliini ayuquciirutetaitkut.
That’s what’s making us so addled these days.

Qaillun tua-i ukut kingunrulriit waten ayuquciinaki piaqluki

They have no idea about these descendants like this
or they think they’re in some place.

Maa-i mat’um nalliini yuilqumi-llu tua-i tuqungraata qaillun ayuquciitaqluki.
These days, even when they die in the wilderness,
they have no idea about them.

207
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Tang tua-i mat’um nalliini tua-i-wa waten caknernarqellriit amlleriameng
You see, because there are now a lot of things bringing struggles these days

208
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Maa-i waten au͡gkut ayuqellrunritut, waten.
People back then were not like this, like this.

209
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,000
Tua-i ca murilkerrlainarluku.
They always observed everything.

210
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:43,700
Uksuarmi-llu wangkuta cali tan’gaurlurni waten qalaruquratullruitkut
And in the fall, they would always talk to us boys like this

211
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,500
Ciunerkamteńek, tekitarkamteńek ellmeng atuqemeggnek.
About our futures, what’s in store for us, that they are experiencing.

212
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Aarnarqellriit apertualuki, yuilqumi-llu.
They would indicate what was dangerous, in the wilderness too.

Cat, cat-llu maani nunam qaingani pengurraat qerturalriit aterluteng.
These things on land, elevated hills, had names.

All of the creeks had names too.

Nanvat-ll’ ilait cali aterluteng.
Some of the lakes had names too.

216

Tua-i nalluvkenaku man’a nunam qainga.
They knew the layout of this land.

217
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:32,000
Tau͡gken mat’um nalliini makut maa-i yup’ut apertuatnanriamteki
Yet these days, because we don’t point those out to our children

218
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Mat’umek yuilqumek cat-llu nallungluki,
kuiget-llu, nanvat-llu, qertulriit-llu makut.
They don’t know the wilderness or what’s on it,
rivers, and lakes, and these elevated areas.

219
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:59,000
Camek-llu tua-i piaqata apcaaqellriani cam nuniini camek piciitnek
And when something happens,
when we ask them where it happened to them

220
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,500
Wall’u yuk tauna waten maa-i mat’um nalliini tamarilalriit, tamalalriit.
Or a person these days would get lost, they get lost.

221
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:23,500
Tauna, tauna tangertellra apcaaqellriani cam nuniini tangellrucianek

When they ask the people who saw it about the area where they saw it
they don’t know its name either.

222
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:32,500
Taum-gguq avaniirluteng tau͡gaam pinaurtut apertuatnanriamceteng.
They would say it happened over there
because we don’t point those out to them anymore.

223
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,500
Ca tamalkuan wangkuta qalaruyutek’lallruyaaqaput

We used to talk about everything, but we didn’t always experience them.

224
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,500
Tau͡gaam tekitaqamteki elitaqaqluki.
But when we reached them, we would recognize them.

225
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yaa, qanruyutekun tau͡gaam yuk yuugarkauyaaqelliniami.
Yes, a person should live through traditional wisdom.

226

Yaa, qanruyun atunrilkuniu elluarrluni yuungaitelliniuq.
Yes, [s]he evidently will not live well
if [s]he does not adhere to traditional wisdom.

Ilaminek-llu waten nuqlilluni calrianek.
[S]he will also lack what their peers work on.

They used to tell us this back then:

Man’a-gguq qanruyun atuqumteggu, maligtaquluku-llu yuukumta

If we adhere to this traditional wisdom, obey it while we live
we will live well.

230

Qessalertevkenata, qavaarpek’nata.

However, yes, we wouldn’t reach what they indicated yet.

233
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,500

But when we reach it these days, we recognize it.

They said to pay attention to our instructor
yes, we should watch his mouth.

236
