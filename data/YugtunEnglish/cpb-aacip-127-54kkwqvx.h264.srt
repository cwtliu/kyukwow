Well now, Qunuin, come here.

Now, I don’t have any other memories, yes.

However, I have memories of the people I was born in time to see.

I want to tell them about the old ones before. (Yes, okay, yes.)

5
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:27,935
Tangerrluku tua-i.
If it is opportune.

6
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:34,695
Waniwa ellangellrulria tang amani Cevv’arnermiuni.
You see, I grew up over in Chefornak.

00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:42,805
Tua-i Cevv’arnermini ellangellruunga. Tua-i maaten...
I grew up in Chefornak. It turned out...

8
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:56,778
[Kinguq]lirkaita-llu, kinguqliput-gguq kinguqlirkait nunam maani qaingani yuum ayuqucirkaanek ayagniriciqut.
And their descendants, they said that the descendants of our descendants would begin what people would be like on this earth.

9
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,550
Ayagniriciqut.
They will start it.

10
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:17,612
Nutaan-llu-gguq tua-i kinguqliit ukegkut tua-i imutun tuar tang imna man’a maa-i mat’um nalliini yuut atungekiit man’a.
And then they said that their future descendants, it seems that the people have started going through this these days.

11
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:22,531
Tangvagluku tuar qalartelallrulriit.
It seemed they spoke as if seeing it.

12
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:27,481
Maaten waniwa waten elliama umyuaqnaunka.
I reached this age and remember them.

13
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:34,619
Tuar im’ tangvagluki nunat makut yugkait qanrutkelallrukiit.
They talked about it as if they were looking at the people that would live in these lands.

14
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,738
Akleng-gguq.
They said, "Pity."

15
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:50,782
Tamana-gguq tekiskunegteggu tuaten ellillerkarteng imutun makut-ll’ ayagyuarit qimugkara’urlurtun ellirciqut.
They said that when they have reached the point that they would become like that, even the young people would become like puppies.

16
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:54,626
Tangrriu maa-i.
Look at it now.

17
00:01:55,002 --> 00:02:06,389
Taringutkeqapiaralaranka au͡gkut yuut tuar tang imna man’a tua-i tangvakapiarluku qanrutkelallrukiit.
I completely understand that those people would talk about this time as if they were truly seeing it.

18
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:14,514
Aling aren, maa-i-ll’ tua-i tekilluku yuut makut, nunat yuita tamarmeng.
Oh my goodness, and now, these people have reached it, every person from the villages.

19
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:19,608
Naliat-llu pinritevkenani, nunat tamarmeng tekilluku.
And none of them was left out as all villages reached it.

20
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:33,871
Tua-i-gguq tuaten ellirarkaugut makut ayagyuat qanruyut’seng man’a cakenriqunegteggu, qanruyut’seng atunriqunegteggu.
They said that people would become like when the young people start disregarding traditional wisdom, when they don’t adhere to traditional wisdom anymore.

21
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:43,359
Aling aren, wiinga tang tua-i imum-llu ap’ama yaani Cevv’arnermiuni wagg’uq uum Elegtam
Oh my goodness, also, my grandfather over in Chefornak who was known as Elegtaq

22

Tua-i tauna Elegtaq ap’aka qanemcitullruuq. Agaani ellangellruyaaqelliniuq Iigmiut unegkut nuniitni, kiatiitni.
My grandfather Elegtaq would tell stories. Apaprently, he grew up across there around Eek, upriver from there.

23
00:02:56,784 --> 00:03:05,346
Wagg’uq wani Allauguullrini. Tauna ap’aka Elegtaq tamakumiunguyaaqelliniuq.
They called that place Allauguulleq. My grandfather Elegtaq was from there.

24
00:03:05,722 --> 00:03:17,022
Tua-i imna-llu tanglallrukeka wii keggani Qaluyaani Aluskam Arnaanek pilallrat arnassagaq au͡gna.
I also used to see the old woman they called Aluskaq’s Mother out there on Nelson Island.

25
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:23,729
Tauna-llu-gguq tamatum nalliini Allauguullratni unisngatellrunrituk.
He said that they were not separated when it was called Allgauguulleq.

26
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:31,647
Tua-i-gguq yuuciak man’a unisngatellrunrituq taukuk yuuk.
He said that their lives were not apart from each other.

27
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:46,109
Aren tua-i waniwa mat’umek au͡g’umek ava-i qanemciqertua. Tangrriu waten atam.
Well, I have just told that story. Consider it like this.

28
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:57,709
Tua-i wiinga’urluq-llu waniwa qanruyun tamalkuan atunrilengramku tua-i tau͡gaam ukvertallruunga.
And, pity me, even though I didn’t use all of the traditional wisdom, I believed.

29
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:06,472
Ukvertallruunga qanruyukaramnek. Tamalkuan niisngayugnaicaaqaqa qanruyuteka.
I believed what little wisdom was passed down to me. I have not obeyed every piece of wisdom passed down to me though.

30
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:13,709
Tua-i tau͡gaam qanelriamek niitaqama ukvetullruunga.
But when I heard people instructing, I would believe.

31
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:19,803
Cali imkut qanrutestekama waten pitullruatnga:
Also, my instructors would tell me this:

32
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:29,816
"Kitaki tangerrluku ilavnek qaillun pimaluten ping’e’rpet angurrlugmek tukaqlugcaqunek.
"Now see here, even if any of your peers do anything to you, never retaliate with bad intent.

33
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:37,216
"Ilalciarluten yuulaqina angurrluk’ ellaicetun ayuqevkenak.
"Live by treating people well, and never be like them.

34
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:46,204
"Tau͡gaam tauna-llu pistellren elluarrluku cali ciukirpianun cali uputniaran, aulukniaran."
"Instead, speak of and treat that person who wronged you well until he goes forth as a better person."

35
00:04:46,679 --> 00:05:01,854
Tua-i aren tamana aturluku ilumun tua-i yuum ilii ilumun pillrulliaqami ulurmiayaaqvigminek taq’aqan quyalallruunga cakneq. Quyapialallruunga cakneq.
Oh my, when a person indeed had done bad, I would be extremely thankful when they would stop looking back. I would be extremely thankful.

36
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:09,698
Tua-i umyuallguteksagutaqamku wii quyapiarutek’lallruaqa.
When we came to an agreement, I would be very thankful for him.

37
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:22,948
Aling aren, tua-i waniw’ au͡g’umek tua-i qanemciqertua tua-i waniwa.
Oh my goodness, I just told that story now.

38
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:32,910
Au͡gna anguqallma ilii carraquiner au͡gna qanemcikaqa tua-i ava-i carraquiner.
I told very little of the story of one of the people I was born in time to see, very little.

39
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:41,842
Tua-ll’ imna waniwa watuam cali nalliinek tua-i waniw’ piqaqatartua, uicung’.
And now, I’m going to speak about current times, cousin.

40
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:55,267
Tua-i watuam nalliini waniwa atam irniangqellruyaaqelrianga tang waten, waten qulnek pingayunek cipluki.
These days, you see, I had this many children, thirteen.

41
00:05:56,204 --> 00:06:12,392
Tua-lli-wa waniwa umyuama kanangnuullra maligtesciigataqa wangnek pingaitelliniama kanangnuuryaaqekuma, imkut tau͡gaam wangnek ayallret.
And now, I cannot succumb to my mind’s dejection, because I will not be doing it to myself when I am dejected, but to those who’ve gone.

42
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:17,555
Tua-i waniw’ teguyunairutnayukluki-ll’ Agayutmun.
Also, I fear that they may no longer by worthy to be taken by God.

43
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:25,649
Tau͡gaam Agayutmek quyamalartua waniwa tangercet’laaki imkut ayagcianka.
But I thank God because he lets me see those who’ve gone from me.

44
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:32,000
Ellmeggnek tangerceteksaitut, tau͡gaam Agayutem tangercet’larai.
They didn’t show themselves, but God lets me see them.

45
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:40,707
Atam unugmi-am uitaurau͡rlulrianga maklua, allavkenii-llam cuyat teguluki iqmiglua.
You see, I woke up and night and relaxes, and without deviating, I took my tobacco and chewed.

46
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:52,313
Iqmigtuumalnguama-ll’ anlluki qemaggluki iqmiutaagka mayurrlukek. Kelutmun waten iggagarrlua tua-i waten maktallagglua uitaqerlua.
And when I had chewed for long enough, I took them out, put them in, and put up the container. I lay facing the back of the bed, and shot up and stayed still.

47
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:59,514
Aren, uitaqainanemni ayuquciqa man’a tanqigpallartuq.
Oh my, as I was staying still, there was a bright light around me.

48
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:11,695
Aren, tanqiim tuc’anga uigarrlua qulka tangrraqa tuar tang imna pikani qulemni waten tanqik uivenqellria.
Oh my, when the light came upon me, I opened my eyes and looked up to what looked like a circle of light above me.

49
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:15,501
Yuut-wa pikegkut pingayun imai.
There were three people inside.

50
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:24,720
Maaten tang tua-i pikavet tangvakaranka yuunka pikegkut tanqiim imaqluki.
I looked up to find that the light up there enveloped my children.

51
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:35,233
Una tua-i alqaat Pangall’aq, Nanugaq-wa, ug’umek aanallgutmeggnek Uyanguamek pingayurlutek.
Here was their older sister Pangall’aq, Nanugaq, and the third was Uyanguaq with whom they shared a mother downriver.

52
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:41,602
Imkunek atulqenrilkeḿeggnek aturluteng pakemkumiutarnek.
They were wearing Heavenly clothes that they never wore before.

53
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:46,946

Oh my, there were happy up there and pitied me.

54
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:53,871
Tua-i ketmun caukanirluki wii ciuggvikluki pikavet tangvaganka tua-i.
I faced the front of the bed toward them, looked up, and watched them.

55
00:07:53,884 --> 00:07:57,884
Tangrrucimtun Agayun quyavikaqa.
As I saw them, I thanked God.

56
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:08,428
Tua-i quyavikluku allam tangercetenrilaki, tua-i elliin tau͡gaam tangercecaki.
I thanked him because no other allowed me to see them, only he allowed me to see them.

57
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:26,478
Atam tua-i taqlua uitaqanemkun pakemna nuniitnek, uluqsaunaki-ll’ tangviimki, nuniitnek qanelria angutnguluni. Aling nallunripakar.
You seem as I stopped and stayed still, up from where they were, because I didn’t look away from them, a man spoke from where they were. Wow, he definitely knows.

58
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:33,709
"Mary, elpet-ll’ waten pimaciquten ukucetun."
"Mary, you will also be like this as these are."

59
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:44,978
Aren, watua cayukataryuklua ugkurluut tutgaraanka tua-i iluvaqertut wangni wavet ciuqamnun.
Oh my, I thought I was going to be pulled away right then, but my dear grandchildren from out there appeared here in front of me.

60
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:54,916

My goodness, when they appeared and watched only me, they, you know...

61
00:08:56,154 --> 00:09:01,741
Unisnganrit’laraatnga. Quy’uqtaarvikuralaraatnga.
They don’t stay apart from me. They always gather around me.

62
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:13,372
Tua-i nutaan tua-i taukunek tua-i waniw’ ciuqamnun quy’uqercetlemni qanrulluki, qanrulluku tauna tua-i
When they had gathered in front of me, I told them, I told him

63

Only at that moment, when my dear grandchildren here were missing me, I asked them to leave me just for that moment.

64
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:36,073
Tua-i tau͡gaam atataarmi tua-i pillerkaqa tekiskan nutaan tua-i tamaani umyugiurutkesqellua.
I told them to be with me as much as they wanted later when it was time for me.

65
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:40,929
Aren tua-i arenqiatua.
Oh my, I was disconcerted.

Tua-i taqeqanemkun taman’ taqeqanrakun tanqik pikna cikcartunga’artuq. Imkut-llu tua-i tangvagtelluteng tayim’ nanteqerluteng.
When I was finished, when that was finished, the light up there was starting to go out. And they had me watch them as they were in some place.

67
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:59,017
Tangvagtelluteng tua-i tayim’ nanteqerluteng waniw’ cikcartunga’arpailgan pikna.
They had me see them as they were there before the light started to go out.

68
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:05,561
Nutaan tangvanriqercamteng tua-i tayim’ cikcarturluni tua-i cik’arrluni tua-i.
When I stopped watching them, it started to go out, and winked out.

69
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:15,136
Cali qavarpek’nii call’ waten ellalinqigcimallruunga, uicung’, ellalinqigcimallruunga.
Also, I didn’t not sleep but given new awareness like this, cousin, I was giving new awareness.

70
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:25,805
Arenqiapaa-ll’ nunakegtaar imna ayagyualriarulriani. Nunakegtaar nunaksunaqpiaq.
My goodness, young people, what a paradise. The paradise where everyone wants to live in.

71
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:31,417
Tanqigcetqapiar. Tanqia ayuqaituq.
It was very bright. There is no light like it.

72
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:39,561
Tuar tang imna kiartellemni maaken ayaglua, waten tua-i qavarpek’nii
It seemed that as I looked around from here, like this, I wasn’t sleeping

73
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:47,968
Tuar tang imna ella nunam im’ qainga waten pilleq qiliim mengliinun.
It seemed that the world was like this as the land meets the horizon.

74
00:10:49,162 --> 00:11:00,725
Imna-wa tang nunam qaingan can’ga tuar tang imna tua-i ulvaiyaaq im’ cungakvayagaq cungackepiaq cakneq.
The grass on the land was extremely green, seeming like the green [ulvaiyaaq].

75
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:06,037
Nunam-ll’ im’ qainga nunaniqsaagpagta tamana tua-i.
The land there was too beautiful to behold.

76
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:19,956
Waniw’ tiiviinek-llu caaqama tangerqacuayaaqerqama cungagcelngurmek tangrraqama nani-kiq taman’ umyuaqeqanricia cungagpak, cungackepiaq.
And when I briefly watch TV once in a while and see something green, I wonder why I don’t remember that extremely green place.

77
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:31,512
Tua-i ellarpallraam ilua tuar tang qiliim mengliinun tua-i nunam man’a qainga tuaterrlainaq ayuqluni tamarmi.
It seemed that the land in the entire world all the way to the horizon was like that.

78
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:37,643
Nunapigmek-llu mat’utun nunapimcetun ayuqelriamek cataunani.
And there was no tundra like the tundra that we have here.

79
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:46,912
Manigcetqapiar, nanvamek-llu tang tangellrunrilngua waniw’ tamatum iluani kuiggarmek-llu.
It was so smooth, and I didn’t see a lake or a creek in there.

80
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:54,506
Arenqiapakar tua-i tang ukatmun waten uyaqunka uivurallemni
My goodness, as I turned my neck like this going this way

81
00:11:54,725 --> 00:12:07,450
Maaten tang tua-i ukatmun piqertua yuut amkut pingayun nangerngaqalriit qatellriamek aturluteng imumek akurtulriamek.
When I turned this way, I saw three people standing wearing long white robes.

Maaten tang tua-i yaavet tangvakaranka Jesus-aamek ilangqellinilriik ingkuk.
When I watched them over there, I realized that two of them over there were accompanied by Jesus.

83
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:24,044
Atam nutaan tua-i quyavikekeka Jesus-aaq tangrrucianek.
I gave greater thanks for seeing Jesus.

84

Cali-llu ak’a ciunguluku uksuaruluku ayagluku tua-i tangerqataruarluku tamaani ayuqengellruunga.
Also, I started expecting to see him first and foremost during the fall at the time.

85
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:37,432
Tua-i waniw’ tangerqataruarturluku.
I kept expecting to see him.

86
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:42,282
Unugmi-llu qakmani cat qavama unicanga
And the things outside at night when sleep left me

87
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:55,989
Unugmi-llu qakmani cat avirliqa’arqata tua-i inangqangnaqsaaqvimnek maklua tua-i ella qagna kiarcaaqaqluku, agyat-llu pagkut kiarquryaaqaqluki.
When the things outside started clamoring in the night, I would get up after trying to lay still and look around outside, and look at the stars above.

88
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:00,477
Avungarkaunrirqata aqumlua tua-i inartaqlua.
When nothing else would happen, I would sit and lie down.

89
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:10,165
Tang ayagyualriani tua-i ella imna aling arenqiapakar ellaksuuminaqsaaqvaa-lli.
You young people, you see, that world, oh my goodness, it is such a wonderful world.

90
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:20,759
Carrlugmek imaunani ellakegtaar imna. Carrlugmek tangerrnaunani. Ellam im’ ayuqucia assiqapiar.
That paradise had nothing bad. There was nothing bad to be seen. That world looks very good.

91
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:31,584
Tanqigceńani cakneq, tanqicukepiarluni. Amta-llu akerteḿek-llu cataunani ellam ilua.
It was very bright, extremely bright. And yet there was no sun in that world.

92
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:39,035
Amta-ll’ tua-i iirluaraunani tanqigceńani cakneq, tanqigpagluni.
And yet it was bright, very bright, [without a source of light].

93
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:44,623
Aling arenqiapakar.
Oh my goodness.

94
00:13:45,142 --> 00:14:00,167
Tua-i tuaten tua-i kiarqurallemni taukut tua-i cali yuut taukut tangvaurluki tua-i. Piinanemni call’ tua-i natetmuruciinateng-llu tua-i tayim’ cataiteqalallruut.
As I was looking around liek that, I would watch those people too. As I did that, they would disappear and I wouldn’t know where they went.

95
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:11,423
Tua-i cataiteqaata cali uyaqutka cayugluki ciuqaqa call’ un’ tangrraqa malruk cali ukuk ciuqamni call’.
When they disappeared, I would pull back my neck and look in front of me to see two of them still in front of me.

96
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:17,911
Yaaqsiggaryuata-ll’ tang elitaqengnaqengramka Jesus-aam ilai elitaqsunrilkenka.
And since they were a little far, I wouldn’t recognize Jesus’ companions though I tried.

97
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:32,192
Aren, una ciuqaqa call’ tangrraqa malrukuk ukuk, una ukaqlia sugtuluni ingna-ll’ yaaqlia sugkillruluni.
Oh my, I looked in front of me to see two people, the taller one on this side, and the one next to him was shorter.

98
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:41,680
Maaten tang tua-i call’ taukuk tangvauraqaragak tuar tang tauna ukaqlia sugtulria Qayum atii.
I looked at those two and it seemed that the taller one on this side was Qayuq’s father.

99
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:46,406
Tua-i tang caqaquurallrakun elitaqnguaqeka.
I felt that I recognized him by what his mannerisms.

100
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:55,750
Tua-i Qayum atak’acagii tua-i imna tua-i maantenglleq, maani uitalangelleq.
It was certainly Qayuq’s father that started to live here, the one who started to live here.

101
00:14:56,925 --> 00:15:01,988
Tua-i tuaten tua-i piqerluku.
That’s all for that.

102
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:17,275
Atam tua-i tamakut tangerqengaqenriqercamki au͡gkucicetun-am call’ tangvauraqarraartellutek tua-i cali tangvangramtek natetmuruciinakek tayim’ cataiteqarillruagka.
You see, when I stopped seeing them, after I watched those two, I lost sight of them with no idea where they went even though I was watching them.

103
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:28,713
Aren, tuar tang imna taukuk kinguagni man’a tua-i ella’urlurput wangkuta cangakevkenaku atuqengarput
Oh my, it seemed that after that, our pitiful world that we live in without thinking anything of it

104
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:44,557
Umyuama-am tekicaku tamaavet tua-i uitallemnun ituliqausnguallemni kavirrlugcelnguq-llu tuar ituliqautellemni
When my mind came upon where I was together with them, it seemed it was a little red when I was alongside them

105
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:50,863
Tua-i wangkurluumta cangakevkenaku ellakngamteggu atuamteggu.
Because we live in this world without thinking anything of it.

106
00:15:53,357 --> 00:15:55,382
Aren tua-i.
Oh my goodness.

107
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:10,101
Nutaan taum kinguani uyaqunka cayugluki piqerlua ayuquciqa man’a cikcartuaranga’artuq cukayugnaunani.
After that, I pulled my neck back and I was slow as if my body were closing up.

108
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:24,676
Tua-i cik’arcan maaten piqertua inglemni-ll’ aqumgayaaqellinilrianga inarrvimni. Tua-i aqumgayaaqellinilrianga inglemni.
When it closed up, I realized that I was sitting on my bed where I sleep. I was sitting on my bed.

109
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:32,751
Arenqiatua tau͡gaam waten elliryaaqeng’e’rma imnanguartua au͡g’umek ellakegtaarmek.
I was in distress through I was like this imagining being in that paradise.

110
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:40,583
Waten-ll’ umyuarteqlua iluani nangerngallemni, nangerngayukellemni:
And I thought this as I was standing there, when I thought I was standing there:

111
00:16:40,920 --> 00:17:00,160
"Arenqiapaa-ll’ nauwa-mi imkut ayagyuarugaat. Arenqiapaa-ll’ maa-i-tuq man’ ellakegtaar ellakluku nunaniryugluteng ellaklitgu akwarpak amavet tayima callerkameggnek umyuarteqsugnaunateng.
Oh my goodness, where are all those young people. Oh my goodness, I wish that they would live in that paradise in great joy forever with no worry about what may happen in the future.

112
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:17,274
"Qaillun-llu pimallerkameggnek umyuarteqsugnaunateng. Wangkuta apqemteńek tuqullerkameggnek-ll’ umyuarteqsugnaunateng uitalleqsarluku maligtaqulluteng alerquutmeggnun yuukuneng."
"And they would have no worries about what may happen to them. And they would live there with no worries about what we call death if they live by the instructions given to them."

113
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,418
Tangrriu.
You see?

114
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:31,181
Tua-i waniw’ imnanguarumalrianga wii makunek maa-i waten tang tua-i pulengtarmek pilaama.
Now, I imagine these things because I do this repeatedly.

115
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:39,487
Tua-i-w’ cam imum pivkalaqiinga. Wangnek piksailngua. Tangerrlua tua-i pivkalaraanga cam imum.
Something causes me to do that. I don’t do it by myself. Whatever it is sees me and causes me to do that.

116
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:50,781
Waten-ll’ ayuquciqa tua-i tanqigmek cikilaraa waten tua-i ayuquciqa man’a tua-i tangerrluku. Nakleklua-w’ tua-i pilallikiinga.
It also gives me light like this seeing how I am. It probably takes pity on me.

117
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:58,106
Atam, atam imumi cali yaani Kuigilngurmi elitnaulallruukut Qaneryaranek.
You see, we also used to learn about the Bible over in Kwigillingok back then.

118
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:08,550
Atam tua-i an’aqama qeraqata’arqama kaigalqa ciuqliquralaqeka.
You see, when I went out and would be on my way to cross over, I would think first about my request.

119
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:18,550
Tua-i-am qerarlua tua-i pillemni ilura’urlurci imna tua-i enemun kiingan unitelaamku
When I crossed, because I would only leave your dear cousin in the house

120
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:26,613
Ayuquciqa man’a tua-i tanqiim tekiareskii uivenqegpak waten avatemni.
Light came upon me in a circle around me like this.

121
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:29,888
Cunaw’ tua-i ayagnirluni.
It turned out that it started.

122
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:35,575
Tuaten tua-i ayagnirluni piyungaqami tua-i pilartuq.
Starting from there, it comes upon me when it wants to.

123
00:18:36,263 --> 00:18:49,250
Tua-i tau͡gaam wiinga cali waniw’ imkut irniarugaanka umyuama aliayuutekenritai nantenrilata, nanelnguunateng-llu.
However, my mind does not grieve over my many children because they’re not anywhere else, and they are not lost.

124
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:59,725
Tua-i ukut ciuqliit waten tangercecimalaata-llu nanelnguicukluki umyuarteq’lartua tua-i wiinga
Since the first ones appear to me, I think that they are not lost

125
00:18:59,726 --> 00:19:06,188
Imkut-llu kinguqliit carrlugmun tekipailegmeng tua-i tayim’ ayaumarilaata.
Also becaues the younger ones go before they come upon anything bad.

126
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:18,164
Tau͡gaam anglirillerluteng ayakatalriit tua-i cali taringnaqluteng nallunaitelallruut, taringnaqluteng.
But the ones that grew a little who were going to go, I would understand because they were clear, I would understand.

127
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:26,801
Imkurluteng-llu, qulmun-llu yagtaarluteng piaqluteng angniyagarluteng.
And the little ones, you know, would raise their hands and be happy.

128
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:35,495
Tua-i tamana tamaa-i umyuama eguruteksuumiitelaraa tuaten ayuqelallrat.
But my mind does not want to [disregard] how they were like that.

129
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:46,283
Waniw’ tau͡gaam wii kingunratgun cali maliggnaluki umyuarteq’laryaaqua kingunratgun maliggluki.
But now, I think about going after them, going after them.

130
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:54,758
Tuaten yuullgukaramni qaillun umyuartequcuumiinaci, kenkutmek tau͡gaam umyuangqerrulluci.
I do not want to think of my fellow people in any way except through love.

131
00:19:57,689 --> 00:20:04,589
Kenkutmek tau͡gaam umyuangqerrulluci tamalkurpeci ilamni makuni yuullgukaramni.
I only want to think of every one of you, my family, my fellow people, with love.

132
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:13,858
Tangerqeka tamalkuan tememtun pitarrluku tangvagyugluku umyuangqerrlua.
I have the mind to see with my entire body what I’ve seen.

133
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:24,496
Tua-i waniw’ au͡gkut yullret angullrenka arenqiatut.
The people that I was born to see back then lived hard lives.

134
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:30,584
Qanruyutmeggnun niisngallruameng yuunertuqitauluteng-llu.
Because they obeyed the wisdom passed down to them, they lived long lives.

135
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:36,290
Nunat-ll’ ukut ellangviinka calriamek niitnarqeksaunateng.
And we didn’t hear of any misfortune in the village I grew up in.

136
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:46,296
Tua-i tau͡gaam akaurtenqegcaara’rqan tayima makut-llu temyigilriit iliit tua-i arulairaqluni.
Only after a very long time, one of the people who had gotten old would pass away.

Waten-llu tua-i mat’um nalliinitun maa-i ayuqsugnaunateng.
And they were nothing like how it is these days.

138

Calriit uunguciicimaaqluteng. Calriamek-llu avaqlirmeggnek naken niitaqluteng.
They wouldn’t know of any misfortune for a long time. And they would hear of misfortune from areas around them.

They would finally hear of something happening to someone after a long time.

141
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:30,353

Now, I started living downriver in Qinarmiut when it was populated. My husband had be live there.
