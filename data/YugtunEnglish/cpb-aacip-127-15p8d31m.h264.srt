…some of it from Oscar and the other.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,900
Waten au͡gna imna qanrutkeqerlaku.
Let me speak about it like this.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Qaneryaraq cakaarciigataqa nallunriqka wii ilii.
I can’t ignore part of the Bible that I learned.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Amlleq nalluyaaqaqa.
There is a lot I don’t know.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Angutet iliit apervikuagarluni wangnun.
One of the men confessed to me.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,000
Tuyuulallemni ayagcetaulua apervikuagarluni iliit qanertuq
When I was a lay pastor, one of them said in a confession

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Qavangurtulria-gguq tang unuk.
That he had a dream the night before.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Ellii tua-i assiilkelluku tamana qavanguni.
He didn’t like his dream.

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,000
Ellii-gguq ellminek tangertuq uquriqapiggluni waten.
He said that he saw himself as very fat like this.

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,000
Pinirluni, cagniluni, uquriluni.
He was strong, tough, and fat.

12

Tua-llu-gguq tauna kenkek’ngani irniami iliit
anngaqliq tangrraa ellminek tangrraarluni.
And then, he said that he saw one of children whom he loved,
the eldest son, after looking at himself.

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,000
Tuana-gguq tua-i kemgitqapiarluni.
He said [his son] was very skinny.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,500
Tua-i takumcunaqluni.
Enri-llu makut amimek tau͡gaam caqumaluteng.
He was pitiful.
And his bones were only covered by skin.

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:26,000
Tua-i-gguq cakneq kenkataqngamiu ellminek ciknakuq umyuamikun.
He said that he envied himself because he loved him so much.

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,000
Ellminek ciknakluni,
“Ciin wii uqurisia? Una-llam tau͡gaam uqurinrilnguq.”
Envying himself,
“Why am I fat? He should be fat.”

17
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,000
Tua-llu taringartarci? Taringesciigatarci-ll’ tayima.
Do youpl understand it? Youpl might not understand it.

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,200
Tua-llu-gguq taringevkaumauq waten tauna qavangurtulleq:
And then the one who had the dream understood this:

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:58,000
Elpet Qaneryaraq tamalkuan nallunritan,
ayuqucirkaq-llu maani nunam qaingani nalluvkenaku.
You know the entire Bible, and you know how
one should be on the earth.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,300
Tau͡gken elpet tuaten ayuqeng’e’rpet irniaten ukut qalarucuunaki
Yet even though you’re like that, you don’t instruct your children

21
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:14,800
Qalarucuilavteng waniw’ kemgitut.
Elpet elisngaluten uquriuten.
They’re skinny because you don’t instruct them.
You are fat in your knowledge.

22
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,000
Tua-llu? Au͡g’umun kanaqerlua piunga.
Nall’artaqa-qaa ukut qalartellrat?
Well? I digressed with that.
Am I in accordance with what they’re saying?

23
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,500
Tua-ll’ ayuquciitua Kass’atun.
Anitia enairqe’rqa.
And then, I don’t know English.
I took Anitia’s place.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,500
Qaillun promote-aq mumigcarauga?
How is “promote” translated?

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Taringumanritaqa “promote the heritage” waten qanelria una.
(Ciumurulluku.)
I don’t understand what “promote the heritage” says here.
(To bring it forth.)

26
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,000
Kitak’ nalqiguteqercia.
(Ciumurulluku.)
Please explain it to me.
(To bring it forth.)

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,500
Niicuitua.
(Ciumurulluku.)
I’m hard of hearing.
(To bring it forth.)

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,200
Ciumurulluku yuullerkaq, qaa?
To bring forth a way of life, right?

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,300
Ii-i, kitak’ ellmarraquiner piqerlaut.
Okay, let’s [cover] a small part of it.

30
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Wangkuta, wangkutnek-wa tua-i wangni
We, us for me personally

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,500
Naliata akwaugaq qanrutaanga, Ayaprucaraam piyugnarqaanga
One of them told me yesterday, it may have been Ayapruca’ar

32
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:15,500
Wangkutnek wii nallemnek tuar tang ayagluta wangkutnek
man’a Yuum ayallra cimilira. Qaa?
From our time, it seems that starting from us, where a Yup’ik
is going is changing. Right?

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Kass’atun makut kinguqliput ellirtut.
Our descendants here are becoming Westernized.

34
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,500
Kass’arngariut, ilait-llu Yugtun taringesciigaliluteng.
They’re becoming Westernized, and some
understand Yup’ik anymore.

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,000
Kass’aturrlainaq tau͡gaam qalarqurangluteng.
They’ve started only speaking completely in English.

36
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:40,400
Tua-ll’ waniw’ Yugtun yuullerkam ayuqucianek piyaaqengramta
And then even if we [teach] what a person must be like
living a Yup’ik life

37
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,500
Makut tamakut Kass’atun elitellriit qaillun elitnauqatarceta?
How are we going to teach those who’ve learned English?

38
00:03:48,500 --> 00:04:01,400
Ataam-qaa au͡gna yuktallerput tengruluteng
ataam ayagniryugngaciqait caknerluta wangkuta yuullerput?
Will our dear children be able to enthusiastically begin
[living] our lives where we struggled?

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Qimugtetgun-llu ayagaluta kayimngina’arturluta-llu
qugtatullruluta Akulmi.
We would travel with dog teams, and we would gather wood
by pushing sleds in the Akula region.

40
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Qimugtaunata-llu ayagatullruluta.
We also used to travel without dogs.

41
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,000
Qanikciurutput-llu elluatuullruvkenateng,
piqertuutaput-llu elluatuullruvkenateng.
Also, our shovels were not convenient,
and our axes were not convenient.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Wangkuta ciuqlirpeceńi
We, yourpl elders

43
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,900
Makut tua-llu-w’ nutaan ciuqliput nutaan tangrruarqamteng
nutaan caknepiallruyugnarqut.
And when I imagine our elders, they probably struggled a lot more.

44
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:40,300
Ukatmun Kass’at tungiitnun calissuutait call’ tungiitnun
ayallerput maliggluku tuarpiaq qacignariinarluteng cat.
As we became more Westernized and using their tools,
it seems that things have been getting easier.

45
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:50,000
Waniwa-ll’ yaaqsingraan wanirpaagaq tekiarcaurrluku
wangkuta unuakuayaarmek ayagluta caqtarturatullerput.
And now, they’ve started reaching far places right away
where we used to strive to reach starting early in the morning.

46
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,000
Tua-llu? Maa-i taringarci man’a?
Well? Do youpl understand this?

47
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,000
Anagarutengqatalliunga?
I might speak too excessively.

48
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,500
Ataku, atata… waten qanruarteqernaamci:
Later… let me tell you this:

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,500
Kass’atun elisnganritua. Uumek-am entertain-amek igangua maaken.
I’m not fluent in English. I’ve received a letter
from here concerning entertainment.

50
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,500
George [?]-arluni igartuq, entertain-aaryugtua-gguq-qaa
maani Elders’ Conference-aaratni.
George [?] wrote asking if I wanted to entertain
here at the Elders’ Conference.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Wii tua-i ayuquciilamku ukut ilaitnek qanerkitqataryuklua
Because I didn’t know what it meant,
I thought they would give me one of these to say

52
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,400
“Paitaput aturluki avani ciunerkamteńi.”
“Following our legacies in our future.”

53
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,200
Ukut ilaitnek wangni qanerkitqataryuklua
angerluku tauna apqaurteka.
Thinking that I was going to be given one of these to say,
I agreed to the one who asked me.

54
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,000
Uungullilria-w’ tua-i.
This is probably what it is.

55
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Tua-i-llu waniw’ taringaqa angniqercetaarcuutngullinilria.
And now, I understand that it’s a form of fun.

56
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,000
Ava-i-ll’ ciuqliinka entertainment-aamun tekitaqan

As I’ve been watching those before me
when it comes to this entertainment

57
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Aturluteng, yurarluteng tuaten pinaurtut.
They sing, and even Yup’ik dance.

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,900
Wiinga atuyuitua. Erinallugtua.
I don’t sing. I have a bad voice.

59
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,500
Cali-llu yuraqtatullruyaaqua tua-i tau͡gaam maa-i yurayuunii.
Also, I used to Yup’ik, but I don’t now.

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,400
Tau͡gaam temcinarqellriamek piarkaukuma ataku 2:00

But if I have to do something funny later at 2:00,
I can make youpl smile.

61
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,000
Tua-i tuaten pitaluki. Amlleriut.
That’s all from me. It’s enough.

62
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,000
…nritaraurtut allrakut.
…years have passed.

63
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:36,000
Tamakut ciuliamta qaneryaraqlallrit taringyaurrluki eglellruyaaqua.
I had started understanding our ancestors’ traditional wisdom
as I’ve gone in life.

64
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,500
Tauna-llu Ellam Yua maa-i watua Agayutmek piyaurtelliniat.
Now, they’ve also started referring to the Spirit of the Universe
as [the Christian] God.

65
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,000
Una cali qilak pamanelngurmek atengqe[rrluni].
This qilak is now also the name of [Heaven] above.

66
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:59,000
…nunarraat iqlutun eglengqata’arpaka’arqata
taum angalkum elluatmun eglerutetullrullinii.
…when villages started going the wrong way,
that shaman would steer them the right way.

67
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,800
Tau͡gaam wangnek alingyagullua…
But because I started being afraid of myself…

68
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Merquumek atengqellruyaaqelliniuq avani ciuqvaarni.
It used to be called a water offering a long time ago.

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,500
Man’a cali aviukarcaraq…
Also, this way of food or water offerings…

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,500
…catairutleq umyuaqluku aviukarqetullrulliniluta.
…we evidently used to offer food or water for the deceased.

71
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,900
Tamaa-i tamakut taringyaurcaaqellrenka.
That’s what I started to understand.

72
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,500
Qemangqavakaamki ancaurtanka.
I’ve ended up talking about them since I’ve held them for so long.

73
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,900
Mat’um ukvemta…
Our belief…

74
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:46,000
…taumek picirluki maa-i ayagyuaput, tamana pitekluku.
…for that reason, [we do that] to our young people.

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,500
Wangkuta assinrilngurmek ellalirturnayukluki
alerquayuirutellriatun ayuqelliniaput.
We have apparently stopped insetruction them
because we might teach them something bad.

76
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:07,000
Maani wangkuta ilamta ukvellgutkenrilamta

Because some of us here have different beliefs,
our traditional custom…

77
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,500
…maa-i tau͡gaam allragnirpak katurcaurcamta
…but since we’ve started holding meetings since last year

78
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Qayugg’ ukvellgutkenrilnguut agayulirtet katurrluteng

Priests who have different beliefs meet and have started understanding
our ancient way of life more and more.

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Eyagyaraq cali.
Including abstinence.

80
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Wiinga waniwa nallunrilkevcia.
Youpl know me.

00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:38,000
Maani Kusquqvagmi ellangellrulrianga
man’a tua-i Kusquqvak kuikluku.
In my earliest memories of the Kuskokwim here,
the Kuskokwim was our main river.

82
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,000
Alcimek Yugtun atengqerrlua.
Alciq is my Yup’ik name.

Tua-i-llu waniwa nallunritlemteńi uumek akwaugaq imna

And then from what I know, I talked yesterday about
using it for support.

84
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Nunam yuini wangkuta mat’umek ak’allarpall’ermek

We people of the land have this extremely ancient instruction
as our support.

85
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:22,800
Man’a-llu teggutvut takarnaqpiarluni takarnairucuunani-llu.
And our support should be respected, and should always be respected.

86
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Makuni maa-i watua tegganeruaramteńi makuni

For us elders today, that cause for respect is there.

87
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:50,500
Takarnarqelriim cam imum tamatum
nunam yui tamakut tegguciumaluki.
That thing we must respect supports the people of the earth.

88
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,000
Tauna-llu tegguciumasteseng ellaita nalluvkenaku.
They also know who supports them.

89
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Taumek man’a ak’allaq ukanirpak tailria teggutek’ngamteggu
Because we have always been supported by this ancient thing

And it supports our lives, we dear healthy ones here
are standing.

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:27,500
Man’a-llu waten ayuqucirput yuum taum atra,
Yugtun atra tua-i pirpakarput.
And the way we are towards a person’s name,
we consider his Yup’ik name important.

92
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Cali-llu Yugtun qanerturalleq cali una pirpakarput
Yuungamta tua-i.
We also consider the Yup’ik language important
because we are Yupiit.

93
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Tauna arcaqerluku akulemteńi aterpagtaarturaulluta quyanaqpiartuq.
I’m very thankful that we call each other [by our Yup’ik names]

Tuamta-llu wangkuta Yugni uumek tua-i nalluvkenata:
And then, we Yupiit know this:

It’s need for respect is always like that,

Taumek tua-i makut makunun kingumteńun ayagyuanun makunun
That’s why for our descendats, the young people here

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:46,500
Elitnaurutmeggnek elitelartut mat’um Kassauryaarturluteng

Una-llu Kassauyaarturyaraq kingumek elitaaqluku tua-i.
And then they learn to be Westernized later.

103
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:26,000
Tauna cali elliini tauna Yugmi ayagyuami uitauq.
That is also in that young Yup’ik person.

angnirluteng, quyaluteng, engelaraqluteng-llu pituluteng.
When they follow their Yup’ik dancing tradition,
they’re happy, thankful, and they laugh.

110
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Tua-i.
There you have it.

111
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,500
Man’a, ilumun man’a atuqengarput maa-i watua
elisngalriit tamakut
Truly, these knowledgable people [must use]
what we are living now

112
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,500
Elitaarteng makunun qatellrianun inglutuutekluku caliarkaqaat.
They must work to oppose these Caucasians with what they learned.

113
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,500
Una assilriim tungiinun caliarteng caliaqerkaugaat.
They must work for the good [of our people].

114
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:48,000
Ilumun-llu ciumurutellerkaa assilriim tungiinun
tengrunaqluni assirluni.
And truly, it’s exciting and good to work for the good [of our people].

115
00:13:49,500 --> 00:14:04,800
Uum wani ciumurucaram avani yaaqvaarni egmianun
nallunrirluku pinrilnge’rmiu
This bringing forth [goodness], even if they didn’t
get it right away a long time ago

116
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Tau͡gaam kinguakun nallunriraqamiu quyapiatuukut
yugni tamamta uumek nallunriraqamteggu mat’um.
But when they know later, all of us people are thankful
when they find out [about this goodness].

117
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:31,000
Tua-i-llu maa-i watua ilaput elluarucimek
aturarkameggnek upteqcaartu’rtut.
And now, some of us are preparing good things
that they will use.

118
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Wangkuta-llu waten tegganrulriani tamatumun
And we elders [must do] that

119
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:45,000
Atunem-llu malrukuk ukuk, pingayun,
wall’u-qaa qavciukuneng angutet
And when two, three, or several men are together

120
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:59,500
Tauna upyuskengaat qanerturautekluku piaqamta
imutun elaqvaqanilriatun pituaput
When we discuss what they are preparing,
it’s like we’re spreading it

121
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,500
Maligcugnarqerkaungan tauna caliarteng.
Because their work inspires others.

122
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:19,800
Tua-i-llu wangkuta tua-i tamana upyutarkaqerput
makut elluarucit aturarkaput aturyuumirarkaurrluki.
And then we must prepare those good things
that we will use so that they will inspire others.

123
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,000
Quyana.
Thank you.

124
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,500
…[ilait] mat’um nalliini ellangellemtun ayuqenrirtut makut yuut.
…[some of] these people these days are not like
those in my earliest memories.

125
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
Unguvanerkelliluteng tuaten.
They even have a shorter life span.

126
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Avani ellangellemni wii arnassagarnek
angukara’urlurnek-llu tangaatullruunga
Back in my earliest memories, I used to see old women and men

127
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,000
Ciisquteng tau͡gaam ayapertuarluki tarritetulinek nengcuunateng.
Ones who only walked supporting themselves
with their knees that didn’t stretch out.

128
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Ayaruunateng tau͡gken.
Yet they had no walking staffs.

129
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,700
Qaillun tayima tamakut allrakungqelartat?
How old would they be?

130
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,000
Hundred-aaq-wa cipluku allrakungqellriit nallunailngurmek.
They were certainly over 100 years old.

131
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Qavcin au͡gkut 100-aaq cipluku allrakulget tanglallrenka
tamakutun ayuqenritut.
Several who are over 100 years old that I used to see
are not like those.

132
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,900
Neng’enqeggluteng, ayarurluteng tau͡gaam tarritaqluteng.
Their [legs] can stretch, and they walk with canes.

133
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Ciisquteng ayaperluki tarricuunateng.
They don’t support themselves with their knees when they walk.

134
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,500
Cam, cam wangkuta maani angukara’urluirucetakut
mat’um nalliini?
I wonder what makes us lack old men these days?

135
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,500
Nallunaitqapiarmek Qaneryaram qanrutaakut waten:
The Bible very clearly tells us this:

136
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:47,000
Angayuqamteńek, aanamteńek, atamteńek-llu narurcillerput
pitekluku yuucirput kepumalartuq nanilicaumaluni.
Because we disobey our parents, mothers, and fathers,
our lives get cut short.

137
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,000
Wangkuta tau͡gaam anglanakevvut maliggluku.
We only do what we think is fun.

138
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:04,500
Au͡gkut angayuqamta aanamta-llu nunulriatun pitarrluta
qalarut’lallruitkut akaarnun yuuqaasqumaluta.
Our parents and mothers back then talked to us as if they were
scolding us because they wanted us to live long lives.

139
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Cunawa tuaten kenekngamegtekut qalarut’lallrukaitkut.
Turns out, they talked to us like that because they loved us.

140
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:18,500
Au͡gna piqaqerlaku waten niitelqa aviukaqsaraq.
Let me touch on what I heard about food and water offerings.

141
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Avani tamana atullruat, wiinga-llu tangaatullruunga.
They used to do that a long time ago, and I used to see it.

142
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:31,000
Tau͡gken angayuqaagka tuaten piyuunatek,
aviukaqsuunatek ak’a taringellrulliniamek.
However, my parents would not make food or water offerings
like that because they had already understood.

143
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,500
Una wani aviukaqsaraq waten atullrulliniata:
yugmun taumun tuqullermun piicagluteng.
Food and water offerings were evidently done like this:
they prayed to that person who had died.

144
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Piicagluteng assirluteng yuuyugluteng, naulluuvkenateng yuuyugluteng,
wall’u picugluteng pillalliniit kaigavikluku yuk tuqumalria
They prayed for good lives, lives without sickness,
or they prayed to and entreated a dead person

145
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Ayuqucirtuumanrilameng-wa kaigallerkameggnek.
Because they were not instruction on [religious] entreaty.

146
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,500
Tau͡gaam Jesus-aaq tekicami qanertuq ellii tumyaraurrniluni.
But when Jesus arrived, he said that he had become the way.

147
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Elliikun camek kaigakumta elliin cikirarkauniluta piyullemteńek.
If we entreat through him, he will give us what we want.

148
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,000
Tuaten ayuqellrulliniuq au͡gna piicagyaraqellrulliniluku.
That’s what it was like, a form of prayer.

149
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,700
Una Agayun nallunricaaqaat ciuliamta
Ellam Yuanek aterpaggluku.
Our ancestors know God as the Spirit of the Universe.

150
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Una tau͡gaam Jesus-aaq ukaqvaggun alaillruan
nallullrulliniat ciuliamta.
But because Jesus appeared recently,
our ancestors didn’t know him.

151
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,400
Niiteqarraalallermeggni-llu Jesus-aaq kiulallrulliniut qanerluteng
They said that when they first heard about Jesus,
they would say in reply

152
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,500
“Ca tauna yuk angssiyaagluni yuuga?”
“Why is that person’s life so important?”

153
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Taringumanrilamegteggu-wa.
It was because they didn’t understand it.

154
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,800
Taumek tamatumek tuaten ayuqluku taringumaaqa.
That is how I understand it.

155
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:05,000
Tuamta-llu atauciq cali yuumaqeryaraq atunriamteggu
arcaqerluku mat’um nalliini.
And because we’ve stopped doing one thing that makes us
live longer, especially these days.

156
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:19,000
Au͡gkut ciuliamta arnat wall’u angutet ayagyuat yuuyugaqameng
ak’anun nunaseng man’a murilketullrulliniat.
Our ancestors back then, when young women or men wanted to live
long lives, they would watch over their land here.

157
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,000
Carangllugcetevkenaku-llu, nunat-llu akuliit clean up-aatuluku.
They didn’t leave garbage in it, and they cleaned up
the areas in settlements.

158
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Ataucimun ciqitaqluki tamakut caranglluut
yuum tutmalqenrilkiinun.
They would dump that garbage in one place
where no one had trod.

159
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,500
Ciuliamta-llu alerquutekluku tamana tuaten.
That was what our ancestors instructed too.

160
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Nunat clean up, nunam mat’um clean up-aarturallra
alerquutekluku.
Cleaning up the land here was [one of] their instructions.

161
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,600
Tamaa-i-nguuq au͡gkut ciuliamta yuunertutiita iqua.
That is the meaning of our ancestors’ long lives back then.

162
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,500
Agayutem man’a nuna pikngamiu wangkutnun carangllirluku
uqlarluku-llu atuusqenritaa.
Because God owns this land, he doesn’t want us to
leave it trashed or polluted.

163
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Menuunaku ciuliamcetun atuusqumauq.
It must be left pristine like our ancesotrs.

164
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,400
Tuaten-llu ayuqekumta, qanruyutengqertukut ciuliamteńek
And if we’re like that, we have traditional wisdom from our ancestors

165
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,000
Tuaten ayuqekumta-gguq akaarnun yuuqerciqukut.
They said that if we’re like that, we will live long lives.

166
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,000
Temvut-llu una pinirluni nangengqaarkauluni.
Our bodies will also be standing strong.

167
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:28,500
Ilaput-llu naulluum, naulluunangraata-gguq tuaten ayuqekumta
tamatum naulluutiita agturngaitaakut.
And they said that even if those around us are sick,
that sickness will not affect us if we’re like that.

168
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:40,700
Agayutem tamaa-i quyatiin mat’umek nunaminek wangkutnun
navriuteklerminek menuunaku aturtelluku yugnun.
That is God’s gratitude for people keeping his land pristine
that he has lent us.

169
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,400
Agayutem-gguq tamana quyatekaa yugmun taumun
akaarnun unguvaqertelluku.
They say that God’s gratitude toward that person
is having him live a long life.

170
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Tuamta-llu tamana taperluni apqiitnek nukalpiaruluni
wall’u piculuni angutnguli arnauli-llu ayuqlukek.
And on top of that, what they call great hunters or those who are good
at catching animals, both men and women.

171
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:09,800
Tuaten akiliumalalliniluku Agayutem yuk nunamek
mat’umek kenagciuralria.
God apparently rewards a person like that
who cleans up this land.

172
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,000
Ukanirpak man’a engelkarrluku alerquutnguyaaquq.
It’s an ancient traditional instruction to this day.

173
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:26,000
Au͡gna-llu niitellerput, “Atan aanan-llu takaqikek unguvamanaurtuten
nunami Jehovah-m agayutvet elpenun cikiutekellrani.”
And we heard, “Honor your father and mother so that you will
live long in this land that Jehovah your god has given you.”

174
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Tuaten ayuqekuvet qanrucunaquvet man’a iirumayuinaitarput
wangkuta yumteńun…
If you are obedient like that, we should not hide this
from our children…
