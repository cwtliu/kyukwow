One who caught ringed seals would bring the stomachs
to the community house.

14

That was also accompanied by berries cooked in blood.

Another tradition among those hunters was that
they did not waste any of their things.

They would wholehearted support them, not wanting those
who were trying to make a living feel defeated.

You see, a long time ago, back when we were growing up,
they were not like how it is now.

23
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,000
Cameng, ca tamalkuan pillrunritaat.
They didn’t have everything available to them.

And in the mornings like this, we would not get up being satisfied [with sleep].

Back when we were struggling for food and tools,

But we grew up being pitiful back when we were growing up.

Aturamteńeng tau͡gaten unakelivkenata.
We didn’t even have a lot of clothes.

back when we were growing up.

Those elders back then would not have us be lazy
in the winter before we made our own living back then.

Una wani arcaqerluku wanigga waten uksumi qanikciurun una

Especially in the winter like this, we would always have a shovel
obeying their traditional wisdom.

Tau͡gaam ciunerkamteńun tamaavet elliingnatugluta

We only tried to keep putting animals to catch in our future.

Pissuryuumarinqertellriani umyugarput qacingqavkenaku
tau͡gaam makut pekcunailnguut pekcunarcarturluki.
They would let the minds of those who were on the verge of becoming
hunters convince them to live life easy, but they would
urge those who were stubborn.

39
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:15,600
Waten akingellerkarput-llu umyugaqevkenaku akimeng,

We also did not think about being paid with money,
but thought about how we would be paid with food to eat in the future.

40
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,400
Atam qessanaqsuituq waten caliuralriani, kitugciuralriani
You see, it does not make one disinclined when one
is hardworking or fixes things

Makuneng-ll’ amiiget wangkuta pikenrilengramteki

And even if these doors weren’t ours, we would also help with their doors.

Ca tamalkuan ikayuutekluku allanun wangkuta

Everything we did was to help others, those around us,
who were trying to survive.

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,500
Tau͡ga umyugaitnun wangkuta waten nalukaniisqumaluta

We did that so that they would uplift us in their minds.

It would be true,

I also do that now when I am grateful like this,
when someone helps me and makes me grateful

Cirlagmun ellinguarucuitaqa, tau͡gaam elluarrluku pillerkaan

I do not wish for them to feel defeated, but I push them
to do well in my mind.

Tau͡gatnaluci umyugartualuci caliuratukuvci, una-llu elpeci

If you do that, wisely being hardworking, your time to
make your own living is well on its way.

48
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,000
Tua ikayuutekciqaa tamana kia imum umyugalgem.
That will help whomever is wise.

Waten makut [agliurturluta]-llu piaqamta, naugga pissulriani

When these people [have sexual relations with girls within a year of their
first menstrations], you know, the paths becomes bad for hunters, and there
is no path to go to hunting grounds.

50
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:43,800
Tua kitugtellriatun tamaaggun kituggluku tamana wangkuta

It is as though that is correcting that within us
so that we could make our own living.

51

Tau͡gaten wangkuta alerquun maliggluku imumi wangkuta tau͡gaten

That’s how we grew up back then, obeying instructions
without succumbing to our mind’s desire for an easy life.

52
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,500
Qacingqauranrilamta tau͡gaten temvut tau͡gaten una ikayuumaluku.
Ikayuuluni tau͡gaten pitullruuq.
Since we did not succumb to our mind’s desire, that helped our bodies.
That used to be of help.

53

Tau͡gaam teyqiquassiyaagaqamta cangnatugaqamta iliini

But when we were clumsy when were striving to be hardworking
sometimes, we would be emotionally pained as we tried to make a living.

54
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Maa-i waten aqumgaurluta eglercuitellruukut tamaani.
We didn’t sit like this when we traveled back then.

55

Tamaa-i elluatun mat’um nalliini umyugairutuci ayagyugarni.
Aqumgaurluci-llu eglercaurcavci.
These days, you young people are becoming spoiled.
It’s also because you sit when traveling.

56

Qaill’ tau͡gaam tayima makut maani angayuqerpeci, aatavci-llu

However, if your parents and fathers somehow do not raise you
[in the old way] like that, some of you probably will not do that.

57
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Tamana tau͡gaam nangyariyutekluku pikuvciu nutaan tamakucicetun

But if you [are afraid of] that, you may definitely be like your parents.

58
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,000
Tau͡ga-i au͡ga qanruskiici au͡g’umeng [atu’urkiarulriameng].
He just told you about what would be useful.

00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Tau͡ga aturraarluku waten qanrutkaqaat imkut qantulit

After experiencing it, those teachers would
talk about it after using it.

Maa-i-llu man’a qaneryaraq cali nutarauvkenani.

And this traditional wisdom is not new.

Wangkuta-llu maa-i qanengnaqtulini tamakuneng

And we who try to pass on that traditional wisdom,
it has also come to us.

Because this traditional wisdom is for improvement,
self improvement for us, and improvement for you young people.

Tua-i-ll’ wanigga nugtarciiqukuk cali kanani pingnatugyaran,

And so, we will not move to subsisting down in the ocean,
how to subsist.

Qaillun ak’a imkut cassuutait cali, cassuutellengnaarit

We will also point out how their tools worked,
their handmade tools.

Imkut pingnatugaqameng pingnatuuciqlengnaarit.
The things they used when they subsisted.

We are reluctant to part with you young people when you’re
going to travel, as if you are going to come back from over there.

Tua-i-ll’ elpeci eglertarkauguci tau͡gaten, au͡gna tekiteksailkengarci

And then, you must travel like that, trying not to destroy the future
you have yet to come to, trying not to destroy it.

71
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,500
Waten wanigga ayagyugaam ilii man’a iliini ellmineng navgaquq.
Some young people here destroy themselves now.

72
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Kia, kia tau͡gaam navyuitaa cuum, ellmineng tau͡gaam navgaquq.
No person destroys him, but he destroys himself.

He also destroys himself including his future
that he has yet to experience.

If youpl¬ want to live according to our2 traditional wisdom,
our traditional wisdom [is not fun] even though there
are a lot now.

Even if you do not use them sometimes as you adhere to them,
if you get lonely, your minds will be filled with what
you must use, what you must strive to use.

77
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:02,500

However, if you try to hold on to everything fun, you will not
gain anything, and your minds will not be filled [with wisdom].

Maa-i-am makut maa-i wangkuta pisteput ataci tayima maa-i

Now, when those who help us, your fathers, go down to the ocean,
youpl¬ probably hope that they would catch some of this food.

79
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Maa-i man’a neqkaq enurnaritulria mat’um nalliini, uum nalliini.
Food becomes scarce these days, these days.

80
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:41,000
Tau͡ga-i canairulluni. Iliini-llu tau͡ga aquisciigalingluni.
You can’t do anything anymore. And sometimes, you can’t play.

Cali makut pingnatulriit tukalriit makut arulaiyuunateng tukalriit

Also, when these strong hunters, those who are strong without stopping,
even though they are not without food these days, they become skinny.

82

Tau͡gaam nangengqaluteng irumegteggun caknaaluteng piurallrata

However, as they were standing on their legs and struggling,
they became like that.

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:15,500
Tau͡ga-ll’ tau͡ga tamaani tamaa-i cakviuqapiggluteng tamakut cakviullruut.
And back then, they would work extremely hard as they struggled.

84

Waten-llu nunanun waten ayagaqameng qayateng ellaita eglerulluki.
And when they traveled to villages like this,
they would travel with their kayaks.

85
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,000
Tamaani-gga tugarpatullrunikiit.
Back then, they would chisel a lot of ice.

Ellaita eglerulluki iruteng aturluki pingnatugluteng,

They would struggle, moving them using their legs,
not sitting like this.

Irumeggnek aturluteng tau͡ga imkut tukatullruluteng

They would use their legs to push forward, even if it wasn’t
always that, even if it wasn’t only for spring seal hunting,
because it was how they survived.

88
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,000
Atam imumi wangkuk…

Wangkuta tamaani wangkutneng pissurpailemta tamaani

Back then, before we started hunting by ourselves,
we would always work on subsistence.

90

Imkut qanelriit niilluki tau͡gaten ayuqesqelluta pitullruitkut

We would listen to the teachers telling how how we should be
concerning subsistence.

And then when they started hunting, the ones whom the animals
were afraid of would be revealed when they subsisted.

Tau͡gken imkut umyugarteng calivkallrunrilkiit cali tau͡ga

However, those who did not work on their minds would also
be revealed through their subsistence.

93
00:14:51,300 --> 00:15:00,300
Piyuilkelleq una nunaniqsuituq. Wii-ll’ nallunritaqa waten
neqkameng unangyuilliqaqama nunaniqsuituq.
Being incompetent is not enjoyable. I also know that when
I cannot catch food, it is not enjoyable.

94
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:11,500
Arnamun elliyuitellruut imkut aipangyuitellruut

They wouldn’t be set up with women, they wouldn’t
take wives before they first caught bearded seals.

95
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:25,500
Tau͡gaam malrurqugnek-llu tau͡ga waten maklagtaqameng,

But when they caught bearded seals twice like this, this young person
would not keep it twice, but would distribute it among people,
takelmurluku as they call it.

96
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Qecigtuumaan tau͡gaten malrurqugneng tau͡ga piaqluku.
They would do that twice, including the skin.

97

Tuamtellu waten aipangumariaqan, aiparumariluni piaqami,

And then when he gets married, they would be afraid that his wife
would distribute thin skins.

98
00:15:45,300 --> 00:16:04,000
Waten-am cali tau͡gaten taukuk malruk pillrungraagneng,

And even though that had been done with two bearded seals like this,
when he takes a wife and catches another bearded seal,
they would have them distribute them including the skin.

99
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,000
Tau͡ga cucunarqelriaruluteng tamakut tamatum nalliini.
We envied those at that time.

But when they had looked for things for themselves, I think they
were like that when guns were scarce, and it seemed that
animals to hunt [were not plentiful].

101
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:39,000
Cali maa-i mat’um nalliini imumi imarpiim et’ullra canimetellrani

Also, those days, when the ocean’s wasn’t very deep,
they would also chisel the ice at that time.

102
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:53,000
Maa-i-llu man’a cinaq tayima wangkuta uitayarallput unani

And these days, our places where we would stay on the coast
when we traveled down to the seashore where the land would
be far inland is now down in the ocean.

103
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:04,000
Waten tayima mile-aq tekilluku kessigingatuq tayima

Where we would stay down there is probably a mile out from the shore.

Au͡gani ayuqellrunrituq maa-i mat’um nalliini tamaani

Back then, it wasn’t like how it was now when we
first became observant.

Wall’i tau͡ga tamaani waten imkut nutegkun piyuitellermeggni,

Or, back when they didn’t use guns, when they only harpooned

Waten mallgungerraarluni ciku ulyuum nalliini

After they would approach the ice during flooding season,
when the ice was going to come off back when they didn’t use guns

107
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,000
Tau͡gaam saskumegteggun tau͡ga uqlitumauratullrullinilriit.
But they would stay ready with their tools.

108
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,500
Tau͡ga-i-llu pivingurautemeggni pugurangaqut imkut unani pitarkait.
And then as they were set in place, the animals down there
would start surfacing.

Tau͡gaam-gguq cali una waten tau͡ga uluryassagaqernauraat

But, they said that they would try to scare it off like this
with their atlatls.

Tau͡ga-i-gguq uluryallagaqan-llu-gguq narulkarpegnaku, pinritnaurtuq.
They said that when it would be scared away,
they wouldn’t harpoon it.

111

Tau͡gaam-gguq tua uluryacaqangraatni pektenrilnguq

However, they said that one that stayed even when they tried to
scare it off, only then would they harpoon it.

112
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,900
Tau͡ga pitullrulliniut tamaani.
That’s what they used to do back then.

Waten-llu-gguq pug’aqameng ungait mermun kucirtaarallrit-ll’

And they said that when they surfaced like this, they would be
able to see water dripping from their whiskers.

114
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:35,000
Tamatum nalliini tau͡gaam pikateng amllengraata

But at that time, even though they had a lot to catch,
some of them would be in need because they didn’t have tools.

115
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Tau͡gaten tau͡ga pingnatugaqameng tamaani tamakut pingnatulriit
When those hunters would subsist like that back then

116
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Tau͡ga nangtequatait amlleqaquq, amlletullrulliniuq.
They had a lot of suffering, there used to be a lot.

Waten-llu una imkut kaugpiit nakacuit imkut merneng imangqetulit

And the walrus bladders that would be filled with water like this,
they would have to keep it warm when they had no more water.

118
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Merteng nang’aqan qanikcamun, qanikcameng imirraarluku
kem’meggnun qamavet elliluku urugciraqluku.
When they had no more water, after filling it with snow,
they would put it against their flesh inside to thaw it.

119
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:34,700
Tau͡ga-i tau͡gaten-am tau͡gaam merkangengnaqnaurtut cali

That’s the only way they would get water before the snow melted.

120
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Nangtequatait amkut, imkut amllertut.
They had a lot of struggles.

Cali waten pingnatugaqameng tamakut ilait tau͡ga man’a

Also, when some of them subsisted like this, this subsistence
is something that came to us from long ago

122
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,000
Tau͡gaam makunun tekisnganrituq au͡gna.
But it hasn’t come to these people here.

123
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:06,500
Talliteng aturluki kanani pingnatutullruluteng, tallimeggneng aturluteng.
They would use their arms to subsist down in the ocean, using their arms.

124
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:27,000
Tau͡gaam tamakut anguaruciryaraat tamana anguarutkiuryaraat

But in making their oars, in making what would be their oars,
they would be instructed to make one lighter, and the other larger.

125
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Cali tamakut tamaa tegumiaqetukait amlleriluteng.
The things they would hold would also increase.

Una wanigga legcik cali, legcigmeng pitukiit,

And this gaff, what they call legcik, was essential.

127
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Tau͡ga tau͡gaten piaqameng kanani pikaq tamaani pavingangraan
When they did that, even though animals were available
down in the ocean

128

Tau͡ga pavingayaaqengraan tau͡gaam tau͡ga pikaq pavingang’e’rmi

Even though the animals are available, they sometimes do not get any.

129
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,500
Nangtequaqerraarpailegmi unaknaqsuituq kanani.
You do not catch anything down there without struggling first.

130

Tau͡ga nangtequaqerraarluni tau͡gaam talligmineng aturraarluni,

Only after struggling using his arms, after using them for a long time,
some people who subsist catch them.

131
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:31,400
Tau͡ga-ll’ tau͡gaten piaqameng cali una wani qayarteng pirraarluku
And then when they did that, after taking care of his kayak

Tuamtellu caknaaluteng, caknaaluteng qayarteng un’ pau͡gavet

And then they would struggle, struggle to try to put
their kayaks inland where it’s not dangerous

133
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,700
Tamakuneng tau͡ga pingnatukengameggneng unangaqameng.
When they catch those that they hunt.

Nutaan pingnatukengameggneng unakengarteng tauna

Then they would put what they had strove to catch
around their kayaks.

135
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:06,000
Keyimelkuni una-llu tenguan ilii teguluku.
And if he’s alone, it would take some of its liver.

136
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,700
Nunanun ayagluni tau͡ga irugni-am aturlukek aqvaqurluni.
He would run to the village with his legs.

137
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,600
Tanglurteng tau͡gaam. Tangluicuitellruut.
But they had snowshoes. They always had snowshoes.

Tau͡ga-ll’ nutaan nunat imkut waten anciqut

And then the villagers would come out like this,
watching the one who was appearing on foot.

Cakneq tau͡ga nancuumiitqapiarluteng tamaq’apiarmeng.
Not one of them wanted to be anywhere else.
