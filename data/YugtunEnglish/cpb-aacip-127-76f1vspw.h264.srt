When we were boys back then, our parents

They wanted me to partake in the community house.

And so I obeyed them, since I did not go against my parents’ wishes.

But since they were not young, since they were old, I lived without going against their wishes.

According to their request, I would go to the community house.

Yet when we entered the community house, there was a great many people all the way inside.

8

Man’a-llu nakirnermeng pitukiit man’a kanaggun pugyarangqerrluni mayuryarauluni kanaggun.
And the area here that they call the side wall had an entrance from below where you would go up from down there.

The community house would be quiet when they spoke.

Qang’a-llu cali ukuk teggenrurtellriik nulirqelriit mermeng enuqitevkarpekgnakek ullakarlukuk nallunrilkumtekek cali mertarlukek.
Or also, we should not let an elderly couple lack water, go to them if we know them, and get water for them.

Since we are no the same, some people would regard what they said as if they didn’t see or hear it.

Tau͡gaten-am tauna qanruteknauraak tau͡gaten ayuqelria.
They would speak like that about one who was like that.

And he doesn’t bring down those around him, and he doesn’t speak unfavorably about those around him.

41

The same for the young people, and the same for small children, those speakers would tell that person do be like that.

42
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:11,113
Tau͡ga-ll’ ilumuunganani tau͡ga ayuqaquq.
So, it seems that it’s true.

43
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:25,197

You know how when some do insignificant things to us, they get angry.

He told me to live without using it.

52
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:38,451
Nutaan cali arnaukan nutaan tau͡ga kiuqeryugnaipallaarluku tauna qaill’ eq’uklua pikan.
Especially if she’s a woman, I should not reply [badly] to her if she treats me badly.

Kiuqeryugnaunaku ulurluku pisqellua.
He told me to turn away from her without replying.

54
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:55,873

Then he said that if my age-mate, if I do that from my age-mate, if he keeps doing that to me

55
00:07:57,232 --> 00:08:02,643
Nialiak kinguvaralua, naliak-llu picuilkellua
One of them pushing me back, and one of them saying I’m not a good hunter

Kinguvaralua pikan, qang’a-llu caitnilua naliatneng tayim’ piciqanga picuilkellua, caitnilua-llu, carrlugaitnilua.
If he pushes me back, also saying I have nothing, one of them may say that I’m not a good hunter, and I have nothing, no little thing.

He said that if we can’t take him anymore that we should then reply.

My father used to instruct me like that, to reply with anything I want.

59
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:37,226
Tau͡ga-i-gguq taum pistellernaama taqciqaanga taum tau͡gaten kiukumni.
He said that the one who picked on me will stop if I answer him like that.

60
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:43,821
Tau͡ga-am murilkurallemni ilumuungatnaurtuq cali tauna.
In my observation, that would seem to be true as well.

00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:58,232
Wangkuta tang ayagyugarni ak’a ugg’un tau͡gaam teggnemteggun eglerqurallrulriakut.
You see, a long time ago, we young people only went forth through our elders.

62
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:03,942
Taukuk tua pirpapaqiarelukek civunermeng qantulik.
They held the two who spoke about the future in very high regard.

Kiitau͡gani makut maa-i waten ellirtuq: man’a kiartelqa eneneng allakauqapiaralrianeng makuneng pitangluni.
Eventually it became like this: when I looked around, there were completely different houses.

65
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:33,519
Nevurrlainarneng enengqerrluteng muragaq aturluku enmeng iluanun.
They had houses made completely of sod, using wood inside their houses.

They made various things.

69
00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:01,032

If they’re in the house, they put grass underneath, and spread them out for matting.

Wagg’uq makut naqtat, imkut takliriluki curuneng pituluki.
They called those naqtat, the ones they made long and used for matting.

Then inside their house, it would be beautiful with those stuck in with little tack-like things.

72
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,293
Ena-ll’ tamana ataucimeng cungqerpegnani.
And there wasn’t just one person in that house.

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:25,123
Cali taukugtun tau͡ga-i qaneryaraatun atauciuguq wii cumigartaqama.
It’s one with the [men’s] traditional wisdom when I look closely.

We do not hear any surprising traditional wisdom from them.

86
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:14,993

They would say, "There will be more of these people, more and more."

No matter what they do to us, let us not lower ourselves. Let us try to work with them as much as we can.
