Ellangellruunga pau͡gani yuilqumi nunangqerraqluta wall’ uani Tagyaram paingani nunangqerraqluta kiimeta.
I grew up where we alone had a settlement inland in the wilderness or downriver at the mouth of Tagyaraq.

But when I was a girl, we would be in the fish camps in the summer, then in the wilderness inland in the fall with no one around us.

Uani-ll’ call’ uksumi Tagyarami yugtaunani elatvut.
And downriver at Tagyaraq in the winter, there was no one around us.

Tua-ll’ maurlumni wii uitalua maurluma anglicaraqnganga, maurluugma anglicaraqnganga.
And I stayed with my grandmother because my grandmother raised me, because my grandparents raised me.

143
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:41,586
Ukugnek tau͡gken arnagnek cali ilalua. Ilakluta tua-i.
However, I lived with two other women. We were a family.

And then when we went there to a populated place, she would also say this to me when I was going to go out in the morning:

Kitaki-gguq nakukekatnga qakemkut, naanguaqumta-llu nakukekatnga qimakilii. Akinauryaqunii-gguq.
If the people outside picked on me, and if they picked on me as we were playing, I should run awy. She told me not to retaliate.

When I was a girl, when we were girls, she would speak to us about how we should behave for the day.

That why we feared her because it seemed that she was scolding us.

153
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:14,178

When we didn’t adhere to her wisdom, my grandmother would shout at us as if scolding us.

That’s why we were scared of disregarding her wisdom.

If we don’t gather tall cottongrass to hang fish in pairs, we will ask for things.

Taumek qanruyuteput qigcignarqellruut.
That’s why we respected the traditional wisdom passed down to us.

175

However, she said that if we think it’s too little and ignore it, the worms will eat it, the worms will destroy it, flies lay eggs on it, and it will get worms so it’s no longer edible.

181
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,919
Neqkaugarkaunrirluni.
It will no longer be edible.

And then she said that should we get a hunter, since we’re all women, even if there’s a lot of food to process, a woman should not be overwhelmed by them.

185
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:29,358

And she told us to throw the slop from cutting fish to where people have not trod.

Neqalleruar-gguq yuum qemirrlukngani caassiksunaituq.
She said that since a little fish is the backbone of a person, it should not be disregarded.

Assiilkiurluta-llu neresqevkenata.
She also told us to eat without disliking anything.

She said that if food is scarce, we will not dislike or reject anything, since a person truly will not reject anything if he is hungry.

Yaa, tamaani ellangeqaarraallemteńi waten yuk naulluuluni nangteqluni piluni tuquarkauluni tua-i piaqan
Well, back when we were growing up, when a person was suffering in sickness and was on the verge of death

When he died, his caretakers would prepare him, taking him down from somewhere here.

They would only make noise over those who’ve gotten into accidents, such as if someone drowned.

Tau͡gken mat’um nalliini tua-i inerquumananriameng-wa tua-i inerqurnanriamceci wangkuta caciirulluteng.
These days, however, since they are no longer admonished, since we no longer admonish you, they do not act appropriately.

365
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:46,040
Waten-llu neplianaurtut aaraaqluteng tua-i maani nunat akuliitni.

They used to admonish against that.

367
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:26,725
Tua-i-llu nutaan waten cali ayakata’arqameng cali
Also, when they were going to travel like this

Tua-i-llu tekitenrilameng, tekitenrilata qaill’ tua-i ayuquciinaki qanenrilata.
And then when they don’t return, they don’t know what happened because they didn’t say anything.

372
00:55:22,776 --> 00:55:28,262
Piciatun maa-i mat’um nalliini ayagangameng.
It’s because they go to random places these days.

00:55:54,363 --> 00:55:56,835
Wall’u tuancukluki.
Or, we think they’re someplace.

377

Maa-i mat’um nalliini yuilqumi-llu tua-i tuqungraata qaillun ayuquciitaqluki.
Even when they die in the wilderness these days, we have no idea about them.

The young people these days have completely left behind what we were like before we were young, these young descendants of ours.

379
00:56:50,758 --> 00:56:54,329
Cameng enuqitenritellrata arcaqaqai.
They’re worse because they don’t lack anything.

Wangkuta ayagyugaullemteńi ca tamalkuan nuuqluku pillruamteggu.
Because we lacked everything when we were young.

381

Makut civuqliit pingnatullrat nalluluku.
They don’t know how our ancestors survived.

It’s because they’ve started taking anything they want and need.

Tau͡gken-am maa-i mat’um nalliini Kass’at amlleriata makut-ll’ ayagyugaat tan’gurraat qaillun ayuqliriluteng.
These days, however, since there are a lot of Caucasians now, these young boys have become strange.

390
00:57:56,857 --> 00:58:03,503
Mat’um arcaqerluki merkam piyukai. Uyviirutellriatun ayuqekai merkam.
This alcohol especially affects them. Alcohol makes them foolish.

391

Umyugarraa iliini navguraqaa tau͡gaten pissiyaagpakaraqata, man’a erneqegtaar Agayutem cikiutii iqluggun aturpakaraqatgu.
He sometimes destroys his mind when he does that too much, when they do too much wrong in this day that God gave.

For those, my mind sometimes wants to speak thinking like this:

395
00:58:30,455 --> 00:58:36,874
"Wangkutnun taqellrunritukut. Agayutem piliaqelqaakut. Tauna pinrilengramku canrituq."
"We were not made for ourselves. God made us. It’ll be okay if I don’t do that."

396
00:59:08,903 --> 00:59:18,565
Wanigga elpeci tan’gu’rni tamalkurpeci niitellriani, niicugnilriani una tau͡ga umyugaqerniarci:
Now, all you boys who hear and are listening now, remember this:

"Elpeneng yuurtellrunrituten. Agayutem tau͡gaam caliaqelqaaten, yuurcitelqaaten ellii yuknaluten.
"You were not born of yourself. God, instead, made you, and had you born to be his child.

"Tau͡gken elpeneng maa-i ayatmun pilriaten. Cali elpeneng picurlatmun piaqelriaten.
"However, you stray by yourself. You also bring yourself to misfortune.

399
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:49,923
"Kia yuum uqisqiangaitaaten maa-i yuungnaqurallerpeni elliin avatiikun. Agayutem tau͡gaam uqisqiumaciqaaten kaigakuvet tan’gu’rni elpeci."
"No person will shelter you as you live aside from him. Only God will shelter you if you boys ask for it."

400
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:56,010
Maa-i niicugnilriani tamalkurpeci qanrutnaamci. Niiskicia.
Let me tell all of you who are listening now. Hear me.

401
00:59:56,183 --> 01:00:03,383
Imumi makuneng pingvailemta yuut assiq’apiarallruut tamalkurmeng.
Back before we had these Western things, every single person was extremely good.

Maa-i tau͡gken nalluvci maa-i tan’gurraat makut niicugnilriani ca tamalkurmi piciqaangaanariluni.
Now, however, to you boys who are listening now, everything has become commonplace.
