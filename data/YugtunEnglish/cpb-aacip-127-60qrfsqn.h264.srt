Well, our Yup’ik language. We’ve been speaking Yup’ik now.

00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:38,750
Man’a-qaa elpeni makunun ayagyuanun nalluyagutnarqenrituq, ciin-llu?
To you, should the young people not forget it, and why?

6
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:41,785
Nalluyagutnarqenrituq.
It should not be forgotten.

7
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:57,410
Pitsaqa’artevkenani waten arnassagaurquralriamek wall’ temyigilriamek nallarkengkuni qanerteryugyuartuq tauna yuk.
If that person by chance comes across an old woman or an elder, he might need someone to speak for him.

Elizabeth Howard’s children downriver.

But since they are so hindered by k/q and r/g distinctions, they don’t speak much Yup’ik.

14

Ca, man’a wangkucicetun qaneryararput cagmarnarqenrituq.
Um, we should not lose our language.

When he goes among Caucasians, he can speak like them, then when he goes to his own people, he can speak like them.

Some... I swear, last question. This is the very last one.

Ilait Kass’at waten qantuut: taukut-gguq yuut quyungqalriit tua-i yug’uluteng ellaicecitun-llu allataunateng ellarpiim iluani.
Some Caucasians say this: those people gathered there who are indigenous, there is no one else in the world like them.

20

Ellait kiimeng yug’uluteng, piciryarateng-llu ellait kiimeng pikluku. Allat-llu piciryaraicetun piinanateng.
They are the only people like them, and their culture is unique to them. And no other has a culture like them.

Tua-i-llu-gguq qaneryarateng cagmaamegteggu tua-i tayimqerrluteng. Saagartellriatun-gguq tua-i.
And then they say that when they lost their langauge, they disappeared. It was like they were scattered.

22
00:02:51,320 --> 00:03:03,160
Elpeni-qaa man’a wangkuta Yugni qaneryaraput cagmaqumteggu saagartellriatun iqukliciiqukut? (Yaa.) Yuk piunrirciquq?
To you, if we lose our Yup’ik language, will we go extinct as if we were scattered? (Yes.) Will there be no more Yupiit?

23
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,350
Yaa, tuaten piciqukut taringutesciigali’irrluta.
Yes, we will do that, becoming unable to understand each other.

A Yup’ik here and our ancestors didn’t speak much of anything else, only mostly Yup’ik.

And then if a little Yup’ik forgets these Yup’ik things, I just told you about it.

Ilaitni wani inerquigaqama waten, waten wangkucicetun qalarulluki imkut Yupiayagaat, waten kiularaatnga: "Taringenritamken."
Somtimes, when I admonish these little Yupiit speaking in our language, they answer me like this: "I don’t understand you."

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,240
Amta-llu Yupiayaaruluteng, wangkucicetun-llu qalarulluki inerqurluki.
And yet they are little Yupiit, and I speak admonishments to them in our language.

Ilaita-llu, ilaita qanernaurtut, "Kalikamteńi tamana igausnganrituq," makut wangkuta piciryaraput piaqamteki, nalqigtaqamteki.
And some would say, "That’s not written in our textbooks," when we explain our culture to them.

29
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,530
Makunun high school-am kalikainun ingluangluteng.
They’ve started leaning to these high school textbooks.

And because it was theirs, when these Bible appeared, we recognized what the old ones would say back then.

Tuar-gguq nalluvkenaki makut Bible-aat imaitnek qalartelalriit, inerquutekluki tua-i.
They said that they would speak as if they knew about the Bible, even their admonishments.

The admonishments have truly existed since ancient times.

When we were small and slept in the community house, the old men would speak to us.

Allakaita-llu makut nasaurluut enemi. (Bike-an ayauteqatallia.)
And the girls would be separate in the house. (He might take your bike.)

Tuaten tua-i ayuqellruuq. (Bike-an aqvau. Aqvau bike-an.)
That’s how it was. (Get your bike. Get your bike.)

And I would go to bed in the community house after gathering grass for a pillow, but would take off my skin boots.

55

Maa-i makut kinguqliit qanrutaqamteng tamatumek ayuqucillemnek asgurakelaryugnarqaatnga.
Now, when I tell the next generation about what I was like, they probably doubt me.

Tau͡gam angukara’urluut waten pilallruatnga: "Piinanerpeni pingnaqkuvet, pingnaqengkuvet tuaten ayuqngaituten.
But the old men would say this to me: "As you go, if you make your own living, you will not be like that.

57
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,080
"Kingunren nalluyagutenrilkuvgu."
"If you do not forget where you came from."

Tua-i-llu cali qanrutaqluta waten:
And then, they would also tell me this:

"Piinanerpeni erneq aipiqerluku unguvakuvet, kinguliaraten," makut kinguqliit cunaw’ maa-i piluki
"As you go, if you live to see another day, your descendants," it was apparently the next generations here

62
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,090
Qalarutlerkait tekilluki.
I would come to speak to them.

A person speaking like this does not speak of anything else in my observation, when I started being observant.

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:28,370
Yuk un’ qalartelartuq yuum qanellra cangallruvkenani, allamek qanruyutetaunani.
A person speaks of things that are no different from another, without any other traditional wisdom.

67

Cali waten up’nerkami, qanruyun cali waniw’ piuguq, arnaunge’rmeng-llu qanrutkaqluku.
Also, in the spring liek this, this traditional wisdom still exists, and even women talk about it.

Ayaruq una up’nerkami pegingasqenritaat snuukuungraan, wall’ ikamrangraan, wall’ piyuangraan.
They told us never to be without a staff in spring even if we’re traveling by snow machines, sleds, or walking.

Kiagmi-llu cali waten nunam qaingani cali ayakan cali ayaruq pegingasqevkenaku.
And if one walks on the ground in the summer, they also said not to be without a staff.

Imkunun nunapiim qaingani tungulriit imkut uitalalriit nallunrilketen. Tamaa-i tamakut aarnarqelriit.
You know of those black things that are on the tundra. Those are dangerous.

71
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:16,760
Tuavet yuk tuskuni, murugareskuni tegumiarilkuni camek tamarciquq.
If a person steps there and is pulled down without holding anything, he will disappear.

72
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:26,070
Tau͡gken tegumiangqerkuni tamatum muriim tegumiaran anernera anirturciqaa.
However, if he is holding something, that piece of wood he’s holding will save his life.

73
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,750
Makut maa-i qanruyutek’lallrenka.
This is the wisdom passed down to me.

74
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:43,400
Anagulluki cali makut kinguqliit pisqevkenaki, makut cali irniarit.
They also told them not to be too excessive with their descendants, including their children.

75
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,680
Tamaa-i tamakut qanrutkelallruit.
That’s what they would speak of.

76

Wiinga maa-i tau͡gaam mat’um nalliini umyuaqengaqluki.
But these days, I start remembering them.

And when I speak like this, I start remembering some of what they said.

78
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,520

You probably have something else to say, or ask.

79
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,300
Lucy-wa apnaluku.
I intended to ask Lucy.

80
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:23,240
Makut-qaa nasaurluut-llu arnat tegganrit qanruyucilallruit?
Would the elder women also pass down traditional wisdom to girls?

81
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,000
Yaa.
Yes.

Yes, his late mother would always speak to us about that traditional wisdom and instructions when she was alive.

84
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,390
Tuamta-ll’ cali irniyaramek, cali-llu uingyaramek.
And then about how to bear children, and how to have a husband.

Tua-i-ll’ cali iralurcuuterluteng muriit imkut uivtanqeggluteng muragkun kapucarauluni.
And then they also had wooden circular calanders that they would stick wood into.

86
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:04,130
Erenret tuani, erneq tua-i tuavet piaqan tauna nugtarrluku tuavet kaputaqluku.
When the days, when the day reached that, they moved it and stuck it in there.

Or, he would speak to us about what we shouldn’t do.

Nayurpallulallrukeka-wa wiinga atavut takaqellrunrilamku.
I would mostly be around our father because I wasn’t reserved around him.

92

Charlie and I would mostly speak to him.

And sometimes after going with her, I would go home to be with him,

To you, Lucy, should we not forget the old Yup’ik wisdom today?

However, they would tell me this: as I go, I will start teaching.

But their parents, in my opinion, if the parents speak to the ones who only speak English about the Yup’ik way of life [in English], it would be better.
