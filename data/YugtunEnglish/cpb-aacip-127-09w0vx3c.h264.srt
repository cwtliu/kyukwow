They say that it repeatedly freezes and depletes its [flood] water.

115
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,000
Tau͡gaam imumek cikuugaqami tuatnasciigataqan nutaan merpanglartuq.
Only when it’s frozen and can’t do that, there is flooding.

116
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,500
Cali makut kuiget qanikcarmek amllermek imangqerrluteng

Also, when these rivers have a lot of snow, the ice isn’t thick.

Mamtulaucimitun mamtunrilan imartung’e’rmi ulerpagnayukluku

Because it’s not as thick as it usually is even with a lot of water,
I don’t think it’ll flood because of that.

118
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,200
Tamaani-qaa yuut wani nengelvakayagqan
Did the people back when it used to be extremely cold

We didn’t hear about anyone freezing to death
because we had warm fur clothes.

122
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Maa-i cali nenglling’e’rmi nengllirlallni tekiteksaitaa.
And even though it’s cold now, it doesn’t reach the cold it used to.

123
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,000
Wangkuta tua-i maa-i elluatunek aturangqerrnanriamta
Because we don’t have appropriate clothes anymore now

Nengllicuaqerqan nengllirniluku piyugtukut.
When it’s a little chilly we like to say it’s cold.

it would flood or not?

Tua-i-w’ tamatumek qanruskemken ava-i maraq man’a…
Well, I just told you about the marsh here…

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,000
Qau͡gna-qaa tangvagluku wall’u-qaa unegna?
Did they watch the area upriver or downriver?

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,400
Waniwa-am waten qanikcing’e’rmi up’nerkami tau͡gaam nallunaituuq.
Even though there’s a lot of snow like this now,
it only gets foreseeable in the spring.

130
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,000
Waten puqlanirraarluni unugmi nenglliqulallra,

When it gets cold at night after being warm like this,
they call that repeated freezing.

131
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,800
Ca tekilluku nengllilallrua?
Until when would it be cold?

132

When summer came late up on the Yukon,
the ice melted on the 10th of February.

Man’a Kayangut Anutiit qukallra kiturluku nutaan kiagyungellruuq

When that happened, summer started to set
past the middle of May.

I think it was about 1936.
I think it was about 1936.

Summer will set later than it usually does.

These days, they also use Easter to gauge the seasons.

139
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,400
Kinguqsigaqan kinguqsigiciqniluku kiallerkaa.
When it’s later [than Easter], they would say summer will set late.

140

Ciuqsian cali Paaskaarmun cali kiagyariurciqniluku.
When it’s before Easter, they also say summer will set early.

141
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,400

So we don’t observe groundhogs?

142
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Tamakunek nalluukut.
We don’t know about those.

From what you saw growing up, what would they do this time of year?
How would they do them?

144
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Cavakalallrunritut tamaani.
They didn’t do too much back then.

145

I grew up mostly in the wilderness; we didn’t live in settlements.

We only tried to gather these various things.

147
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Tamatum-ll’ nalliini Kuigpak neqaitellruuq.
And at that time, there was no fish in the Yukon.

When he was a boy also, there was [a time of] no fish too.

Kuigpak tamana neqaitaqami cetamani ukuni allrakuni neqaitetullruuq,

When the Yukon has no fish, it apparently has no fish for four years.

151
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,000
Alqunarmek neqairtevkenani; allamikuaqan neqai ikegglingiinarluteng.
The fish wouldn’t suddenly disappear; the fish declined every year.

152
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:51,000
Tuatnaaqan tamatum nalliini, neqaitellran nalliini ellangellruama
When that happened at the time,
because my earliest memories are when there was no fish

153
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,900
Yuilqurpallurmi uitatullruukut, nunani uitayuunata
We stayed mostly in the wilderness, not in settlements

154

Including my blood siblings.

Neither did our mother and father Yup’ik dance.

But they didn’t explain why we didn’t do that.

158
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,800

How did youpl prepare to go to spring camps?

Tamaani-wa Paaskaam kinguaqaani angyaput upaulluki uptelaqeput,

Right after Easter back then, we would prepare by moving our boats,
even setting up tents.

160
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Cali taluyat, taluyarkaitnek up’nerkami piluteng.
And fish traps, they [made] fish traps in the spring.

161
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000

What about the women?

162

Arnat-llu-w’ tamaa-i issratnek tuaten caliluteng

And back then, women would make grass packs
to store the meat they dried

163

Can’giirnek, luqruuyagnek tuaten kineryilaameng,
makunek-llu yaqulegnek kineryiluteng.
Because they dried blackfish, even pike,
and dried these birds.

164
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,000
Kiagmi tamakunek kineryanek
Those dried meats in the summer

Fish-anek-wa nererrlainallerkarput pitekluku

Because fish might be our only food, they dried birds
also because we didn’t have freezers here.

166
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,000
Qaillun freezer-aalallruat?
How did they use like freezers?

167
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:18,500
Pi, amaqliqa elagulluku ekviim qacarnerani nunamek pilillruuq.
You know, my older brother made one out of the land
by digging the side of a cliff.

168
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,400
Uksumi tau͡gken cikumek imiraqluki
In the winter, however, he would fill them with ice

169
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,800
Canegnek ekiarluki kegglallernek tuani.
Lining them with grass that he sawed there.

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Tuaten cat qemaggnarqellriit up’nerkami
tuavet qemaggluki assirupakayuitellruut.
When the things that needed to be stored in the spring
were stored there, they wouldn’t spoil too much.

171
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Tau͡gaam tuaten maanicetun watua kumlivigunateng uitalallruut.
But, that’s how they lived without freezers like we have here now.

172
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000

That happened once.

Also, when I moved here, it was [over]full here once.

175
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,200
Kan’a kanani ingkut bridge-at qeraryarat
The bridges, qeraryarat, down and over there

176
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,000
Kepenkum qeraryarai ukut pugtercarpiarluki.
It almost made the bridges on Kepenkuq float.

177

Tuaten man’a ulngarteqatallrani qimallruukut Kuigpagmun

When it was going to flood like that here, we escaped to the Yukon
because [Acacaryun] there is on the mountains.

178
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,500
Maaten negetmurtukut maraq man’a mermek imarluni tamarmi
When we went north, it turned out that all of the marsh here had water

179
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,000
Uani Mountain Village-am uatiikun tuvtelliniami.
Because the [ice] apparently choked downriver from Mountain Village.

180
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,800
Qemit tau͡gaam kiimeng nunauluteng.
Hills were the only land [above the water].

181
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,700
Tuarpiaq imarpiulria man’a avatvut.
It seemed like the ocean around us.

Cali qakemna imarturiqercan tuaten cali

When it started getting [over]full up north,
we came toward here again when the tide was going out.

183

Cali man’a imartuqapiggluni.
It was also extremely [over]full here.

Before they elevated these bridges and roads,
it almost [flooded] over them when it was [over]full then.

185
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,000
Tuaten imartutaluku man’a Kusquqvak tangellruaqa.
I saw the Kuskokwim get that full.

186
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Cali 1937-ami piyugnarquq, Kuigpak imartullrani cali
Also, I think it was in 1937 when the Yukson was [over]full too

187
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Tamaaggun-ll’ tengssutetgun ayayuitellruamta

And because we wouldn’t travel with planes through there,
the marsh there was completely covered with water.

188
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Kanaqlagcullemteńi-ll’ tamaani amaqliqa-ll’ malikurlaamegnuk
And when we went hunting for muskrats,
because my older brother and I always went together then

189
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:26,500
Mel’inga’artellrani nalkunek ilapuk ullallruapuk

When the water level was increasing, we went to our family
whom we found because the land was completely covered with water.

Tau͡gaam tamakut ciuliaput waten imartungraan

But our ancestors would apparently have spring camps in places
the land wouldn’t be covered [with water] even when it was [over]full.

191
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,500
Tua-i ak’a avani yaaqvanek ayagluku tamana nallunrilamegteggu

As they hunted in the aftermath of [the land] being covered

They established settlements like that because they might
be in dire situations if the water reached them.

(Ii-i, quyana.)
