00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,826
Maligcugnaqluta ellaitnun.
Let them want to obey us.

109
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:17,051
Tuaten ayuqengraata, assiilngurmek-llu atungraata atullrat caknerpak ikiarassiyaagpek’naku, tau͡gaam inerqualuki kenekluki.
Though they’re like that, and even if they do bad things, do not despise the bad things they do too much, but admonish and love them.

110
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:24,773
Iqua-llu tamana atullra assiilucia nasvagluku, tuaten ayuqnaqniluku.
And explain to him the bad consequence of what he’s doing, saying that he needs to be [better] like that.

111
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:32,943
Una-gguq-am nunualuku pilria, wall’u qancurlagalluku pilria
They say that one who always scolds him, or speaks harshly to him

112
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:39,124
Wall’u waten: "Elpenek-wa pingnaqluten qanrut’ngerpet niicugpek’nak tuaten ayuqellriaten,"
Or like this: "Since you did it by yourself though you were told and disobedient, you are like that,"

113
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:46,443
Imutun-gguq kaugtuutatun tuknitauq taumun tuaten qanrucunailngurmun.
They said that that is as forceful as a club to that one who does not heed advice.

114
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:55,722
Tau͡gken-gguq waten pikuni: "Cangallruyuksia elpeni? Elpetun ayuqua wii."
However, they said that if one says this: "How different do you think I am from you? I am like you."

115
00:12:55,999 --> 00:13:01,766
Yuk tamarmi ataucimek umyuangqertuq, umyuallgutekluni.
Every person has one mind, is of one mind.

116
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:12,623
Tau͡gaam qanruyutem-gguq ukanirpak yuk taumek aprumallrungraan, assiitellriamek-llu yuk aprumallrungraan
But, they said that historically, the traditional wisdom, though a person was called that, and though a person was called bad

117
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:19,335
Uum-gguq tau͡gaam yuum qanran kitugtetua ukanirpak umyualinqigtelluku-llu
They said that a person’s mouth has always fixed him, and makes him change his ways

118
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:22,214
Mernuyagucuunaku.
Without getting tired of his [bad ways].

119
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:30,788
Tuamta-llu nerinisngialliqsuunani, "Qaku niisngalriarurteqatarta?" Tuaten-gguq piksaunaku.
Then, do not be impatient, "When is he going to become obedient?" They said not to say that to him.

120
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:39,000
Qacuiqsaunaku-gguq qalaruqurallermikun kitugtarkaugaa tuaten ayuqellria.
They said that one must not despair, but try to fix one who like that by speaking to him.

121
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:48,865
Ak’a tamaani qasgingqetullratni qasgini yun’erraat qalarutetullruit elitnaurluki-llu cayaraitnek.
When they had community houses a long time ago, they would speak to the young men and teach them what to do in those community houses.

122
00:13:48,871 --> 00:14:00,126
Tau͡gaam maa-i mat’um nalliini elitnaurvignek akmaken tekitanek elitnauristengut allakarmeng piciryaralegnek.
But these days, in schools from way out there, they’re getting teachers who have separate cultures.

123
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:03,937
Ukverit-llu allakaunruluteng.
And their beliefs are very different.

124
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:09,810
Cali mat’um tiiviim arcaqerluni tuacetun elitnaurvigmi.
And especially TV’s like that in schools.

125
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:20,466
Yaa, tuaten watua mat’um nalliini ayagyuaput allat piciryarameggnek mat’um elitnaullrata
Yes, through our youth learning about others’ cultures these days

126

Tuaten ayuqlirivkarai qanrucunairulluki, umyuarteng aturluku, nepengluteng pinginanermeggni TV-nek.
It’s causing them to be like that, not heeding advice, following their own mind, starting commotion as they are watching TV.

127
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,684
Tangvagluteng.
They watch it.

128
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:41,982
Ukut-llu makut piciryarat Bible-aat waten ayuqucirturluta:
And this Bible instructs us like this:

129
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:55,355
"Iingita aglumayaraq tau͡gaam kiingan tangvagaat, tegliurluteng, tuquciluteng, akusrarutekiluteng."
"Their eyes are only watching desire, stealing, killing each other, and committing adultery."

130
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:59,787
Iimteggun tungaunaki tamakut tangvagluki.
We are looking right at those with our eyes.

131
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:08,838
Tamaa-i tamatum arcaqerluki iqlutmurutai Kass’am mat’um piciryaraan yup’ut.
That Western culture is especially leading our people astray.

132
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:13,919
Tua-ll’ avavet ukveqkengamteńun.
Then to what we believe.

133
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:24,030
Yuk ukverpek’nani calritesciigatuq, naulluutni-llu elluarrluku ukverpek’nani kitugingaunaku.
A person without faith cannot be healthy, and he will not fix his sickness well without faith.

134
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:28,450
Iluumuulriaruuq tamana.
That is the truth.

135
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:35,653
Ak’a qanemcimariut tamakut tuaten ukverpek’nateng yuullermeggni.
Those people who live without faith like that are already told about.

136
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:44,610
Ukut Bible-aat qanrutaitkut, "Qanrucunailnguq-gguq ukvelriarunrituq." Tuaten qanertut Bible-aat.
The Bible tells us, "A person who does not heed advice does not believe." That’s what the Bible says.

137
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:54,432
Avani-llu tua-i tuaten wangkutni Yupiani tuaten aterpagingauq ukvelriarunrilngurmek qanrucunailnguq.
And back then among us Yupiat, a person who does not heed advice is called a non-believer.

138
00:15:54,986 --> 00:16:01,686
Ukvertalriarunrilngurmek aterpagingauq qanrucunailnguq.
One who does not heed advice is called one without faith.

139
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:07,353
Ciuliamta tuaten tua-i avaken aterpagingaluku tauna.
Since a long time ago, that’s what our ancestors called that person.

140
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:15,033
Tauna-llu-gguq ukvelriarunrilami qanrucunailngurmi yuucurlagtuq-gguq.
And they said that since the one who does not heed advice does not believe, he is living a bad life.

141
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:19,789
Imuuyaaqeciquq-gguq piqunqeggluni pinirliuluni-llu
They said that he may be agile and strong

142

Tau͡gken-gguq ukut ciuliarneret, au͡gkut ciuliamta, tauna waten caciilnguq qanrucunaunani tau͡gken pilria waten qanrutkaat:
However, they said that these elders, our ancestors back then, instead say this about that person who does not know what he’s doing and does not heed advice:

143
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,427
Au͡gtarnaqniluku.
He is inhibiting.

144
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:42,893
Imutun-gguq ayuquq, tuquniaralriit au͡gtarnarinilaraput mat’um nalliiini.
They say he is like one, these days we say those on the verge of death are inhibiting.

145
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:51,116
Tauna-gguq qanrucunailnguq umyuani aturyukii tuaten ayuquq au͡gtarnaqluni-gguq.
They said that one who does not heed advice and follows his own mind is like that, inhibiting.

146
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:59,805
Waten-gguq piarkauguq: caciilnginanermini-gguq alqunaq tayimqertarkauguq paallagluni waten:
They said he is fated to do this: as he does not know what he’s doing, he will suddenly disappear, stumbling like this:

147
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:06,575
Kill’uni, wall’u tuqutauluni, wall’u ellminek akngirrluni.
Sinking, or is killed, or he hurts himself.

00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:08,903
Alqunaq tua-i tuquluni.
He suddenly dies.

149
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:18,307
Waniwa-gguq paallagluni caciilnginanermini uqilalimek wall’u pinirlimek aterpagingallrung’e’rmi.
They say that he "stumbles" while he doesn’t know what hes doing, even though he was called a fast or strong person.

150
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:26,336
Tamana-gguq pitekluku qanrucunailnguut au͡gtarnarqellrianek aterpagtelallruit ciuliamta.
They said that for that reason, our ancestors called those who do not heed advice inhibiting.

151
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:35,363
Yupiit wani qanruyutengqertut imucetun tua-i commandment-aaqluku, alerquutnek. Aturtait elluarrluteng piaqluteng.
Yupiit have traditional wisdom that are like their commandments, instructions. Those who follow them do well.

One of our instructions is like this: those of us...

And speaking like that is like this for our ancestors:

00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:59,819
Yuk-gguq ata tang umyuaqacaulria yuum allam yuinek ayuqucirturiyuitellria yuk.
They say a person who is not very mindful does not instruct others’ children.

155

He only instructs his very own children on how they should do well.

Allam-gguq tau͡gken yua ayuqucirtuayuunaku.
They said, however, that he does not instruct another’s child.

157

Tamakut-gguq tuaten ayuqellriit aterpagingaut umyuaqacagnek kiimurrsulrianek-llu.
They said that those who are like that are called unmindful and stingy [with knowledge].

Then, they said that if we wish bad things upon a person, it will instead come upon our body.
