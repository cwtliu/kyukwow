I was visited by a medicine man in my sleep.  So, I became aware.  Let me tell you about it.  I became aware being in the wilderness sitting alone on the tundra.

Then, before it reached me because it's kind of far I prayed in my deep sleep for God to help me.  I also said that thing moving towards me was beyond my ability to fight it.  I knew that.

53
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:10,290

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:22,522

At that time after I prayed I woke up not myself and felt strong.

Noticing the hands were here, like the right side, I put the curved knife and placed it like so.

I felt it grinding and I closed my eyes.  It was grinding.  While grinding for a bit it poked into the ground.

Call'im qalriuciiyaarluni.  Tuar caviyaaqlu qalrialria.  Tayima tua-i qungagarrluni.
It made a calling noise again.  As in a metal wire making a calling noise.  And then it shrunk.

So, I looked back the arm was gone.  So, I thought and here was an uluaq poked into the ground up to its handle.

Aren, waniwaq cullmerciaqa augna.  Taugaam kilirngacaaqaqa.  Maaten tang im tua-i makcama man'a avateka kiartaqa.  Aren unatet makut maani avatemni petgalriit.
So, did I miss that one.  It seems I cut it though.  And so I got up and looked around me.  There were hands bouncing around me.

63
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:59,240

They didn't do anything but bounce up and jump.  I ran after them to chop them and soon they are still.  As they're still I cut them and threw them any which way.  There were fingers I was throwing separating them.

64
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:17,104
Tua-i nutaan caarkaicukaama nangerrlua uluaqa taun qelkarrluku.  Uterqurlua tuai yaani Kuigilngurmi.  Uterrqurlua.
So, I was done doing that and stood up holding onto my curved knife.  I headed home to Kwigillingok.  I headed home.

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:17,210
Tua-i-gguq elliin-llu caa im yuungcararkaq ilaaqluku yuungcaraqeciqa.
He was going to continue to add to his work of healing as his.

As he had to Ayaginaar.

71
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:37,900
Tua-i tamana umyuama pinrilaku. Piaqa wavet canritniluku waten quurang'erma.  Canritniluku waten quurang'erma.  Tuaten wii piiyuumiitnilua.
In my mind, I didn't want to do that so I said to him looking at him it was okay for me to live the way I did, it was okay.  I didn't want to do it like that.

72
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:46,060

So he came into my dream starting from then when I didn't accept his healing medicine.

73

Aa, tuani tua-i tayima tua-i qavanguqenrirluku.  Tuaten taugaam qavangurturaqlua canek tamakunek.
Ah, I stopped dreaming about him.  But, I started to dream of those things.

Oh, at that instance I looked around after cutting up the hands.  It was early spring.  Christmas had just happened and it was not too long after Christmas.

00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:33,180
Nuna man qaingna urullinilria tua-i.  Nanvat-llu makut urugaqluki.  Taugaam cikuit urumaksaunateng.
The tundra had melted.  The ponds had melted.  But ice had not melted.

77
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:42,218
Makut-llu kuiget miiqaqtaangelliniluteng akulait.  Tua-i kiarrlua.
There was water in between the rivers ice.  I looked around.

The tundra was like that.  I went on home, and when I arrived and went in our house. I realized it was in my sleep and just about to wake up.  I opened my eyes.  When I opened my eyes, father asked how I was so I told him.

79
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:29,240
Qavangurturnilua augumek tua-i tuaten ayuqelriamek.  Waniwa tua-i qavanguqa augna piciukan qelluqurciqnilua upnerqarpak ellam ayuqucianek.  Tua-i waten-am qanruskilaku engelii tekitevkenaku.
I told him what I dreamt of.  I said to him if my dream is true I will watch how the weather is all spring.  So, I said that to him even though I didn't tell the entire dream.

80
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:41,663
Tua-ill kelluqurlua tua-i imumi-llu avani pelatekiulallrat-qaa nallullruan Kuigilnguum painga pelatekalilallra.
So, I kept watch of..you may not know where they pitched tents at the mouth of Kuigilnguq.

81
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:48,444

I think It was Tengmiarsuq's family who went there that I remember.  They were the last ones.  Yes

82

This side of Kwigillingok had tents, down river there were alot of tents.  And, above them there were a lot of tents.  Across from there, there were alot of tents, as well.

83
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:39,147

They use to go there to the mouth of the river.  So, oh my.  That was how.  We went downriver and we stayed across the tent of many people.  My cousin, first child of Avamaq were next door to each other.  He was healthy, long before he went.

84
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:56,875

As we stayed there not long they were catching sea mammal.  I was skinning seal limbs and trying to finish skinning those limbs of skinned ring seal.

85
00:19:57,105 --> 00:20:11,600

As we were in our tent, the door opened from the entryway.  Our tent is a dark tent with light color in the middle to brighten inside.

86
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:27,039
Tua-i tuaten ayuqukut.  Qanertuq iterluni pamai yuk pam tunumni Qayum atiin canritlermini.
That's what we were doing.  He said, coming in that person behind me and it was Qayuq's dad who was living then.

87
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:42,450
Tuall atrat una pia, Acill'aq pia.  Iluracung tang ikegkut ullakarki.  Tuai-gguq atatang elliin iluminek pivakaami ullanrilkai.
So, he said to Acill'aq's name, 'my cousin go see them across the way.'

88
00:20:43,112 --> 00:21:00,922
Tuall piunga wii,  'cat imkut'.  Aren qanertuq, 'tauna-gguq Seg'aq yuunrirtuq.'  Aren, qaillun tua-i pivkenani.  Qaillun pivkenani tamani.
So, I said, 'who are you referring to'.  He said, 'that one, Segg'aq has died.'  There was nothing happening to him.'  He was fine.

89
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:16,480
Aren piunga, 'Qaillun un pia?'  Tuai-gguq-wam antelallni antellerminiu tua-i yuunrilria.  Qecingarcami.
I said, 'how did he die?'  He was spitting blood as he does and died.  He started spitting.

Aren qia, tua-ill tayiima tua-i qerarlutek maliklutek.  Qeraagnek caliyuumiircama calianka pegluki an'ngama nunam qainga kiartaqa.
Oh no, so the two went across together.  After they went across I didn't want to do anything so I put down my work, went outside and looked around the tundra.

91
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:53,590

I was remembering my dream from last winter.  It was exactly to the time he ceased seeing the water on the river bank between the ice.

Aren, tua-i qavangulqa im tekitkacagarluku.
It was exactly the same as my dream.

Oh, I was scared at that time.  I was scared.

They had a medicinal ritual/practice to heal people.  They healed the sick to the end, made them well again giving them more time to live.

97
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:35,250

In the qasgiq when they worked on people who were getting ill from bad shamans, some of them used their arms and make pulling motion holding nothing and a shaman while laying flat would sit up and down.  They were not holding a thing.

The ones who sat up and down, sat and had no way of denying doing anything.

They couldn't say they didn't do anything to him/her.  That's how.

That's how alot of people talked about them.  The shamans said to be good at the time of ritual were pardoned but were transfered to a bad shaman with evil intention.

103
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:30,172
Tuaten tua-i ayuqellruut.
That's how they were.

They put it out to be seen and returned it to them unknowingly or invisibily what became their evil intention.  They or to them it came around back at them.

That's how they were.  I don't know all of it completely but that 's what I had heard briefly.

Since you became aware back then especially up to today what is a teaching you remember or sticks out in your mind you can share.

107
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:39,190
Qanruyutet niitelalten imumi avani nasaurlullraullerpeni ciuliarpenek.
What are the teaching you heard long ago from your elder's when you were a giirl.

our speakers spoke to us like they were scolding.

110
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:11,391

Poor us, we listened sitting very still, and begin to sweat.  Our hands begin to sweat.  We stood still as they spoke.

111
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:30,340

This is what my mom said to me, "when you hear a teacher look at your teachers mouth until they are finished talking.  Even it feels like they are addressing you watch him/her until they are done.

112
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:48,730
Tua-i alerquasteka call aturluku tuatnalallruunga. Nunurngalengraaten tangvaurqiu qanrakun.  Taqkaten taugaam nutaan ulurluku.
So, I followed her advice and did that.   Even it seems you're being scolded watch his/her mouth.  Look away only when they're done.

113
00:26:49,130 --> 00:27:00,690
Tuatnalallruunga.  Ilumun tuatnatulleq yuk qanruyucillminek nalluyaguciiyuitelliiniuq.
That's what I did.  Surely, anyone who took in knowledge like that doesn't forget it.

114
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:18,805
Maa-i pekviirulluta niicugnilallruukut taqkacagaakut taugaam taum qanrucilriim nutaan tua-i nangerrluta tua-i unitaqluku.  Taqeq'apiariikut taugaam.
Then, we stood very still and listened and when the speaker was done, we could get up and leave.  Only when he's finished.

115
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:30,900
Unilluku nangertaqluta tua-i taqaqaakut taugaam.  Nunurnganata niicugninauput nekanaqnganateng nunurnganateng.
We stood and left when they're done talking to us.  It was like scolding us as we listened with emotional pain and they're like scolding.

116
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:52,952
Pinaurtut.  Aren maa-i tang ayuqucirtuutellrita ilait tekitaqamki elitaqlaqenka.  Elitaqaqluku ca tamalkuan elitaqaartaqluku imna qanerturalriit qanrutekvakalallrita ilait.
They did that.  So, now I recall those teaching and recognize them when I reach it.  I recognize all of it or remember some of what the speaker repeated to us.

117
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,673
Caugat tamakut wani iliat qanruyutet?
What were some of those wise words?

They told us the same thing over again.  Their wise words were knowledge passed on and were said more than once.

119
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:26,710
Aren, tua-i ilumun piciulriamek qanlallrulliniut augkut ciuqliit yuut.
So, what they said were pretty accurate from those people back then.

120
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:42,730
Tua-i taumek cali imna makunek call maa-i waten-llu imkulrianek makunek-wa qaneryariurtet ilaitnek yugnek.
So, now we have speakers of the good word (bible) who are our own people.

or that it cannot be used anymore, when I hear that, I think

123
00:29:00,502 --> 00:29:07,977
Umyuaqeqalaqka Jesus-aaq waten qanellra.
of Jesus and what he said.

Wiinga waniwa qaneryaraq alerquun piunrirrluku tekitenritua taugaam qaqicarturluku.
I am now here not to destroy teachings and the law but to finish the work.

Caraungraan man'a ciuqlirtaq inerquutellrunritaa watqapik taugaam qaqicartullni qanrutkellrua.
He didn't say that any of our first teaching were forbidden but said he was here to complete a mission.

126
00:29:33,780 --> 00:30:08,852
Tua-i umyuaqellagturatuaqa waniwa waten qanellra uum Jesus-aam.  Tua-i waniug.  Waniwa tang waten elliama imkut qanruyutkelallrenka tekitaqamki tua-i yugnek-llu elitaqiaqama imkut qanerturallrit qanrit tua-i elitaqaarnaunka.
I always think of what Jesus said.  Always and see at my age now I remember everytime I reach it and when I recognize it in other people the sayings from those mouths I watched come to me.

127
00:30:09,452 --> 00:30:21,004
Yuk-llu tauna tuaten qaill ayuqeciqnilallrat tekitaqan tua-i imna qanrutkumalria tua-i neq'aqaaqluku.

They described how they would turn out.  So, that's how they were.

And sometimes while a young girl my age walked away while they are speaking to us, he would say.

130
00:30:41,490 --> 00:31:04,830
Alingnaqvaatanem augumi, ciin tanem augna an'a.  Niicugniiyuumiilami-wam tua-i avai anllilria. Eliin umyuani assikekni aturturluku yuunaluni.
Oh my that one, why did she go out.  Perhaps she didn't want to listen and left.  So, she will only follow what is good for her life.

131
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:21,206
Waten qanrutkaqluku.  Assiikekngaa tangerqaku elliinek tangerciqniluku. Tua-i waten pinauraat.
That's what they said about him/her.  When she likes something she will see it herself.  That's what they said of him/her.

132
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:37,460

When they moved them their fragile bones crackled.  They were out of position.  They used tuntu skin for carrying.  There bedding.  They crackled.  When they placed where they will rest you can hear bones make shooting noise.

Atam tuani tua-i uinguangyaaqellinilria uinguangyaaqluni.  Allam augum tekilluku angutem.  Angutem-gguq assipiam Alaskam iluani ayuqailnguum.  Iirren, tua-i elliin-llu assikngamiu ingluliurluku yuk tauna nukalpiaq assilria.
At that time, she imagined she had a husband.  There was another man who came to her.  He was a handsome man and there was no other like him in Alaska.  She even liked this very nice young man.

145
00:36:27,191 --> 00:36:42,863
Akleng, maaten-gguq tang imna caqerrluku tua-i.  Caqerluni-am payugtelliniluni.  Payugtarkani-gguq amlleraata qantat atliat tegumiaqaqaa.  Makut-wa-gguq qalliqluteng wavet.
Poor, one day she was getting ready to bring him things.  She had lots to bring him with a bowl at the bottom.  They were piled up to here.

146
00:36:43,133 --> 00:37:06,846
Tua-i igcecaaqevkenaki-gguq tuai payugtaquq.  Tua-ll nugluni tua-i qantaqestaitnun aruqutqerr'aarluki aqumluni utaqalgiraarluni anluni.  Anluni tua-i-gguq am caqerluni tuatnaraarluni an'uq tuarpiaq-gguq ca imna tan'qigpapiaq.
So, carried them with care and delivered food.  So, she came up, handed the bowls and sat and waited then left.  She went out and one time after doing the same she went out and notice a bright light.

147
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:13,100
Iralirluni tan'qigcenani cakneq.
It was full moon and bright.

148
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:20,770
Maaten-gguq tang qasgim amiiganek caqirrluni ukatmun piqertuq.
So, as she went from the Men's house door going back this way she saw...

149
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:32,956
Aqvaqatarniluku-gguq taum aipaqlallran qanrutlallrua. Aqvaqatar..aqvaniararniluku.
That one who was her partner use to tell her he will get her and was going to get her soon.

150
00:37:33,244 --> 00:37:57,040
Kana-gguq kan'a uatiit cikuyuitaa tuai uksurpak nengla qangqungraan.  Aren, qaiyaa, qayaqegtaar-wa kan'a culungqaqalria.  Yuag kan'a.  Tangerqaani-llu anguarutni nalugluku arulaarrluku taisqelluku.
Down below this place the lower side doesn't freeze all winter even it's frigid cold.  Oh, his kayak...a beautiful kayak was parked on the bank and a person down there.  When she saw him he raised his paddle and moved it waving her to come on down.

151
00:37:57,478 --> 00:38:17,318
Tua-i-guur'am kiingan ellakeqerluku tua-i aqvelria tua-i aciini-gguq tuar tutcungaqamiu tutelaaqii aqvaqullermini.  Tua-ill waniug tekitniararluku pamaken kingunranek nepa pamna aaralria.
That's all she had in mind and began to run in the air as she ran or so it seemed.  As she was about to reach him, she heard a scream from above where she came from.

152
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:33,280
Aren-qia ayuqucini-gguq-um caleryiin ellangartuq qetqallaallinilria tuai qetqalliimi waniug qetqallallinil.
So, when her body slipped she realized she had fallen, backward and backward she slid.

153
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:48,827
Maaten-gguq im qayaq neqaqaamiu wavet tangerqeryaaqa yaavet. Tauna-gguq ciquilqun nuuqacuayaaqerluku waniug qetqallallrullinilria qayar im tayima.
She remembered the kayak, quickly looked over there.  Right before the iceless spot is where she fell but that kayak was gone.

154
00:38:49,160 --> 00:39:05,280
Aren, tua-i catailan nutaan nangerrluni ellani man evcugluku.  Piraarlun nunat pikavet tangllinii yuk pikna eniita elatini.
So, it was gone, she stood up, cleaned herself up first.  She looked up to the village and there stood someone in front of her house.

155
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:23,495
Tua-i nutaan tag'uraallinilria.  Aren, tagnginanermini tua-i-gguq at'atang imkut qantat tegumiallni neqangkiliki.  Aren imkuskiq qantarugaat tegumiallrenka natmun tayim piniartat.
She slowly went back up.  So, while she went up, she started to wonder about the bowls she had.  So, those many bowls I carried, where are they?

156
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:49,200
Aren, maaten-gguq tua-i yuk tauna tekitevkenaku qasgim elatiinek taun qayaq tangellruamiu tam'avet ellillruyukluki qantat ullagluki.  Yuum taum pia, "waqaa natmun ayagcit?  Tai tai."   "Uitaqaa, qantat imkut paqteqataranka."
So, she didn't reach that person but because she saw the kayak in front of the Men's house she thought she put the bowls there and was going there.  That person asked, 'Hi, where are you going?  Come here."  "Hold on, I'm checking on the bowls."

157
00:39:49,375 --> 00:40:07,910
Aren, tekicaaqaagguq tauna tangerrvillni qayamek qantartaunani man qasgim elatii.  Aren, avatiit-gguq man'a elaqvaq kiarrluku cat paugkut tung'uuralriit tuai pavani keluqvani elaqvani.
So, when she got to the spot where she first saw the kayak, there were no bowls by the men's house.  So, she looked past and around there and saw black things behind and much further out.

158
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:17,973
Maanten-gguq atatang imkut ullagluki pii qantat imkut tegumiaqellri.  Nerkuamek-llu-gguq imaunateng.
She went to them and realized they were the bowls she had in her hands. And not a single clean bone in any of them.  (Laughter)

159
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:28,985
Aren, tuai-ggur'am avuqiliki naangata taugaam tuai taqluni.  Egtellrullinikai-gguq-am tua-i yauvanun.
So, then she collected all of them until she finished.  She had thrown them out pretty far.

160
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:45,920
Aren, tuai-gguq taun nutaan yug ullagluku tua-i itrulluku.  Itrucaamiu tuai, itrucaku taukut enem yuan cik'arutellniluku tauna im nasaurlurluq.
So, she finally went to that person who yelled at her and she took her in.  Once inside a house, the household members circled around the girl.

161
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:51,930
Qaillun pilria cikuilnguum tungiinun aqvaquryaaqucianek?
Asking her why she had ran towards the water?

162
00:40:52,699 --> 00:41:03,270
Qayam-gguq-wa augum taisqengani nuluraani anguarutni kevegluku atraqercaaqellrulria.
She said she had seen a a kayak and that one who lifted, waved at her with his paddle had made her hurry down.

163
00:41:03,914 --> 00:41:25,000
Tam'aani-llu-gguq tang tua-i caqatarluni kepuriqaatarluni-llu napani qagna napalian anlaryaaqellrulria.  Anenaurtuq-gguq kepurarugaat ukut ak'a taqellrullinilriit.  Iterquriluni-gguq taugken.
At that time, she got ready to do something like cutting trees out there and went out.  She would find a bunch of cut wood already done once outside.  She would carry them in though.

164
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:37,820
Tuamta-llu-gguq taukunek canek ciqluarcesqengatni elagyamun anaurtuq-gguq ak'a tauna imkunek pisqutaitnek imangelliniaqelria.
And when she was told to get food from the cache, she would go out to find the requested food all ready inside a container.

165
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:51,610
Cunawa-gguq tuai taum tekitaartiin.  Imiraqluki tuai aqvawailgaki taukut pisqutait enem yuin.
From that one who was coming to her.  He filled the container household wanted

166
00:41:55,194 --> 00:42:26,811
Apqalliinikiit tua-i.  Atam ukut-wani tuunritqataqallinikiit qasgimi.  Tuani-gguq taum apqiita En'ariissuutem tuunritlermini-gguq qanrutkellrua, 'akleng-gguq tuarpiaq-gguq waniug nasaurluum um acia avelngaat nuniit.  Uugnaraat.
They declared to heal her in the men's house.  The one doing his healing ritual (En'ariissuutem) said this of her, "pitiful, it's as if underneath the girls bedding was home to mice.  Many mice.

167
00:42:27,143 --> 00:42:43,462
Tua-i-gguq tumyaraulria naken iluvaqtaallrit taum angutem tumyaraulria.  Acia-gguq tua-i imna tuaten ayuqluni. Tauna taum nasaurluum acia.
There were many trails from everywhere, man's trail.  That's how it was underneath the girls bedding.

168
00:42:43,568 --> 00:43:16,784
Aren, tua-i-gguq tauna nasaurluq inartaquq.  Tua-ll inangqaluuni qelemngaluni-llu uitaqainanermini ellakegtaarnimek mat'umek narteqertelluuni tauna tuai pugluni amigkun.  Amingqetullratni-gguq igcaranek kalvagyaranek.  Tuai-gguq tailuni tauna imna nasaurluq angulallrukii taum nukalpiam.
Oh the girl often went to bed.  As she layed, with eyes closed waiting she smelled nice fresh air and he would come through the door.  When they had tunnel doorways. That young man would come in and take care of that girl.

169
00:43:17,154 --> 00:44:17,181
Aren tuai, nutaan tuai qasgimi iluani tuunritqatartiin taum inuguagnek malrugnek angutnguaqelriignek qasgilluteng qasgillinilriit. Tuai-gguq taum tuunricestiin tuunricestii tauna arnaruamek ayagcecillruuq.  Taum tungiinun iluvaqtaartiin.  Ayagcecillruuq.

Taum iluiqani angutguam inuguam.
Oh then they got ready to heal her medicinally using two miniature dolls, male and female taking over the men's house.  So the one who performed the healing practice sent a pretend female leave her toward that one who kept coming to her.  He made her leave.  And with her, a male doll was placed next to the girl being the dominant one to block off the man from reaching her.  When that male takes over.

170
00:44:17,727 --> 00:44:38,454
Tuaten tuai atam nutaan taunaurluq imna maurlurlurput assiriyartullinilria tuaten tuai taum tuunricestellmi kinguani.  Assiriluni tuai qaillun ayuqsugnairulluni tuai ayuqellinilria.
That's how that one, our poor grandmother was on the road to recovery after the medicine men worked on her.  She was well and changed from there on.

171
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:49,600
Aren, tua-llu.  Tua-i assiri, assiri...
So, that was getting well.
