When I faced it as it was going to reach me, I knelt here like this.

105
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:11,927
Uluaq waten epuakun tegukeka inglugtun.
I took the knife with its handle like a [?weapon].

106
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:20,728
Tuani piicaggaarlua uitellruunga ayuqucimtun ayuqevkenii tua-i pinirnganii-llu.
After I prayed then, I opened my eyes and didn’t feel like myself, and I felt strong.

107
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:31,936
Tua-lli-wa tua-i maavet unatet elliata waten tallirpilirneret
And so, when this right hand reached here

108
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:37,679
Wavet uluaq tua-i waten piqerluku ellikeka.
I did this with the knife and set it down.

109
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:46,654
Tua-i-llu-wa tua-i qiaryigtellria. Qelempaglua-ll’ wii tua-i qiaryigtellria.
Then it started crunching. I shut my eyes fast as it crunched.

110
00:13:46,663 --> 00:13:51,920
Atam qiaryigquraqerluni nunamun kapuartell’.
As it was crunching, you see, [the knife] stuck into the ground.

111
00:13:52,426 --> 00:14:01,440
Call’ im’ qalriuciyaarluni tuar caviyaaq-llu qalrialria. Tayima tua-i qungagarrluni.
Then something screeched, and it seemed like metal screeching. It withdrew into silence.

112
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:05,745
Aren takuya’rqa talliq im’ tayima.
Oh my, I looked back and the arm was gone.

113
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:14,460
Aren umyuarteqa’artua, una-w’ uluaq nunamun kapusngalria egkuaminun puukaumaluni.
Oh my, I thought to myself, while this knife stuck into the ground all the way to its handle.

114
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:22,716
Aren waniwa-q’ [?cull’ mercaaqautmun], tau͡gaam kilirngacaaqaqa.
Oh my, it seemed to [?], but I think I wounded it.

115
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:33,741
Maaten tang im’ tua makcama man’a avateka kiartaqa, aren unatet makut maani avatemni petgalriit.
When I got up and looked around my, oh my, I saw these hands springing up around me.

116
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:38,111
Uitavkenateng petgalriit qeckaraqluteng.
The ones that sprang up didn’t stay still, but would jump.

117
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:44,281
Malirqaaluki tua-i cakiteraqluki.
I chased them and would chop them.

118
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:49,381
Kiituan uitangut. Uitangata qupurrluki.
Eventually, they stayed still. When they stayed, I chopped them up.

119
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:58,431
Piciatun egqaqluki makut yuarat, piciatun egtaqluki quyungqavkarpek’naki.
I threw these fingers in random directions, threw them in random directions so they wouldn’t be gathered.

120
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:08,906
Tua-i nutaan caarkaicukaama nangerrlua uluaqa taun’ qelkarrluku.
When I had nothing left to do, I stood up and kept that knife with me.

121
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:15,786
Uterqurlua tua-i yaani Kuigilngurmun. Uterqurlua.
I made my way home over to Kwigillingok. I made my way home.

122
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:29,176
Qavangurtulangellruunga tuaten tua-i tamakunek ayuqenrilngurnek uumun imumun Cegg’amun.
I started to dream about those kinds of things in various ways because of Cegg’aq.

123
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:31,746
Cegg’aq una.
Cegg’aq here.

124
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:37,136
Cegg’am waten piyaaqellruanga:
Cegg’aq said this to me:

125
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:41,346
"Alingnaqvaa-ll’ usuuq tang," taangiqluni
"Oh my goodness, you," he was drunk

126
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:45,221
"Usuuq tang yuungcariqernaamken."
"Hey you, let me heal you."

127
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:54,111
Ingna-gguq, ingna-gguq tang yaa-i Ayagina’ar yuungcarallra man’a tekiskii.
He said that he had healed Ayagina’ar over there, the one who made it this far.

128
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:57,436
"Yuungcariqernaamken.
"Let me heal you.

129
00:15:57,941 --> 00:16:08,651
"Eru’urqavet, ervuqa’arqavet ervuqalaryartuten yuungcarikumken unaken taryumek eruutan avuqerluku."
"When you wash yourself, when you bathe, if I heal you, you would bathe adding in your bathwater with saltwater from down there."

130
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:16,821
Tua-i-gguq elliin-llu ca im’ yuungcararkaq ilaaqluku yuungcaraqeciqaa
He said that he would add on who should be healed, then heal them

131
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:19,816
Tautun Ayagina’artun.
Like Ayagina’ar there.

132
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:25,901
Aren wii tua-i tamana umyuama pinrilaku
Oh my, since my mind didn’t want that

133
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:30,686
Piaqa wavet canritniluku waten erurang’e’rma.
I told him that it would be fine if I continued to wash this way.

134
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:37,461
Canritniluku waten erurang’e’rma. Tuaten wii piyuumiitnilua.
I told him it would be fine if I continued to wash like this. I said I didn’t want to do that.

135
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:45,061
Qavanguqevkalangellruuq tua-i tauna ngelekluku ciuniunritelqa.
He started making me dream since then, because I didn’t accept his offer.

136
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:50,661
Tua-i tuani tua-i tayima tua qavanguqenrirluku.
Since then, I stopped dreaming about him.

137
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:55,376
Tuaten tau͡gaam qavangurturaqlua canek tamakunek.
But I would dream about those strange things like that.

138
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:59,516
Uterrlua tua-i tekillua.
I made my way home and arrived.

139
00:17:02,441 --> 00:17:09,391
Aren maaten tang tuani kiartua taukut unatet kepraarluku
Oh my, I looked around after I cut those hands up

140
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:13,711
Tuani tua-i up’nerkaryarturtuq
At that time, spring was nigh

141
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:20,026
Alussistuallruluteng-llu. Waniw’ yaaqsigpek’nani Alussistuallrat.
And they had celebrated Christmas. It was long since they’d celebrated Christmas.

142
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:25,381
Nuna man’ qainga urullinilria tua-i.
The ground surface had melted.

143
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:32,391
Nanvat-llu makut urugaqluki, tau͡gaam cikuit urumaksaunateng.
And these lakes were melting, but their ice hadn’t melted yet.

144
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:38,931
Makut-llu kuiget emiqaqtaangelliniluteng akulait.
And the area between rivers had started gtetting water.

145
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:44,626
Tua-i kiarrlua nunam qainga tuaten ayuqluku.
I looked around with the land like that.

146
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:55,486
Uterrlua tua-i tekicama tua-i enemteńun itrama, qavauciqa nallunriqerrluku tua-i tupagyarturlua uiga’rrlua.
When I went home and arrived, when I went into our house, I realized that I was sleeping, tried to awake myself and opened my eyes.

147
00:17:55,846 --> 00:18:02,566
Tua uigarcama tua-i at’urlua tayim’ uum qaill’ piciiranga qanrulluku.
When I woke up and their poor father asked what happened to me, I told him.

148
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:10,721
Qavangurturnilua au͡g’umek tua-i tuaten ayuqelriamek.
I told him that I had that kind of dream.

149
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:23,171
Waniwa tua-i qavanguqa au͡gna piciukan kelluqu’rciqnilua up’nerkarpak qaill’ ellam ayuqucianek.
If my dream was true, I said that I would watch all spring for what nature out there was like.

150
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:28,566
Tua-i waten-am qanruskilaku engelii tekitevkenaku.
I told him this without reaching the point.

151
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:32,481
Tua-i-ll’ kelluqurlua tua-i.
Then I kept watch.

152
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:41,251
Imumi-llu avani, pelatekiulallrat-qa nallullruan, Kuigilnguum paingan pelatekalilallra?
And a long time ago, did you know that they would set up a lot of tents at the mouth of the Kuigilnguq River?

153
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:47,681
Tengmiarsuunkut kiingan anguqallruanka. Nangenruluteng pingatellruut ellait.
I was only born in time to see Tengmiarsuk and family. I think they were the last ones.

154
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:56,281
Una wani ukalirnerna Kuigilnguum pelatekat un’gani amllepiatullruut uaqlirni.
On this side of Kuigilnguq, there used to be a multitude of tents far downriver.

Waniw’ cali kiaqliitni cali tua-i pelatekarugaat.
There were also a lot of tents here upriver from them.

Agna-ll’ call’ akilirneq ikna pelatelartangqerraqluni pelatekarugarnek.
And across from them, there would be a lot of tents.

157
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:14,316
Anelraqutullratni painganun Kuigilnguum.
When they used to go downriver en masse to the mouth of Kuigilnguq.

158
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:17,481
Arenqiapakar.
Oh my goodness.

159
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,286
Tua-i tuaten tua-i.
That’s what they did.

160
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:29,511
Anelrarluta tua-i ikani akilirnermi uitaluta wangkuta. Yugyagluteng.
We went downriver and stayed across on the other side. There were a lot of people.

161
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:37,831
Iluraruka-ll’ [?]m Arnaan-llu elaqliqlunuk, canritellrani tamaani cayugnaitellrani.
And my cousin, [?]’s mother and I were neighbors, back when she was alive and well.

162
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:45,996
Atam tua-i uitaqainanemteńi unaken tua-i unguvalriarqaqengluteng.
As we stayed, you see, they started catching a lot of animals from down [in the ocean].

163
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:55,551
It’gayagikenka-am ukut qaqingnaqluki tua-i it’gayagiarkanka au͡gkut nayiit amiit.
I made "little feet [?]" trying to finish them all, the ringed seal skins I had to make into "little feet."

164
00:19:55,901 --> 00:20:01,191
Atam piinanemteńi yuk cakem’ amik ikireskii.
As we were doing that, you see, a person out there opened the door.

165
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:10,621
Pelatekangqertukut imumek tungupagmkek, tanqiucirluku qatellriamek qukaakun.
We had a black tent, with a white part in the middle to let in light.

166
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,421
Tua-i tuaten ayuqukut.
That’s what we were like.

167
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:26,311
Qanertuq iterluni pama-i yuk pam’ tununmni Qayum atii canritlermini.
The person said as he came in behind me, Qayuq’s father when he was alive.

168
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:31,526
Tua-ll’ atrat una pia, Acill’aq pia
Then he said to their namesake, he said to Acill’aq

169
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:35,171
"Iluracung’ tang ikegkut ullakarki."
"Cousin, you should go to them across there."

170
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:41,126
Tua-i-gguq ata tang ellii iluminek pivakaami ullanrilkai.
He said that he wasn’t going to them because he was having stomach problems.

171
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:46,621
Tua-ll’ piunga wii cat imkut.
Then I noticed those things.

172
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:52,301
Aren qanertuq, tauna-gguq Cegg’aq yuunrirtuq.
Oh my, he said that Cegg’aq passed away.

173
00:20:52,936 --> 00:21:00,116
Aren qaillun tua-i pivkenani, qaillun pivkenani tamaani.
Oh my, nothing was wrong with him, nothing was wrong with him at that time.

174
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:04,381
Aren piunga, "Qaillun un’ pia?“
Oh my, I said, "What happened to him?"

175
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:10,676
Tua-i-gguq-wam antelallni antellerminiu tua-i yuunrilria
They said that when we coughed up what he coughed up, he passed away

176
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:15,366
Qecingarcami.
Because he’d started coughing up [blood].

177
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:18,111
Arenqia.
Oh my goodness.

178
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:22,291
Tua-i-ll’ tayima tua-i qerarlutek maliklutek.
Then they crossed [the river] together.

179
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:31,141
Qeraagnek caliyuumiircama calianka peggluki anngama nunam qainga kiartaqa
When they crossed and I didn’t want to work anymore, I dropped what I was working, went out, and look around the land

180
00:21:31,371 --> 00:21:35,641
Imna qavangulqa uksuq umyuaqluku.
Remembering what I had dreamt the last winter.

181
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:43,491
Tua-i tekitqapiarluku tua-i tauna yuk arulaillinilria.
That person passed away right at that exact point.

182
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:52,801
Un’a-w’ kuik cali emiqaqtaarluni, makuk ceńak emiqaqtaarlutek pilriik.
And the river down there was getting watery, both sides of the riverbank were getting watery.

183
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:57,661
Aren tua-i qavangulqa im’ tekitkacagarluku.
Oh my, it was exactly what I had dreamt.

184
00:21:58,471 --> 00:22:03,321
Aren. Tuani tua-i alingepiallruunga.
Oh my. I was so scared at that time.

185
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:06,442
Alingellruunga-wa.
I was scared.
