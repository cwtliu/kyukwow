I would ask my mother about everything, because I was my mother’s only child.

Ilarugailama apyutketullruanka.
Since I didn’t have a lot of relatives, I would ask about them.

Pingnaquralput arnani uitaurayuilamta, yuilqumek pingnaquratuamta piyararrarluta-llu pitullruluta.
Since we women who subsist are not sedentary, since we try to gather from the wilderness, we also had practices.

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:22,140
Qigcikluku yuum pivianun, yuum piyaraanun pisqumamayuitellruukut.
Out of respect, we would be told not to go to a person’s place, a person’s gathering place.

Then when the wind picks up on them, they had light pullover garments made of bearded seal intestines

Irnerrlugnek qaspernek all’uki pitulinek.
Seal gut pullovers that they put on.

He would cover the kayak’s cockpit with his hem.

They called that securing it with a rope.

That’s what they did.

339
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,990
Qayaan iluanun iterciiganani meq qumikngani.
Water cannot go in his kayak because it’s in his hem.

Then these boats haven’t sunk.

But this thing they abuse, what they try to abuse brings them to misfortune.

What’s called alcohol is the cause of their misfortune.

343
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,623

When that didn’t exist, no one met with misfortune.

344
00:43:59,623 --> 00:44:07,485
Picurlalriamek niicuitellruukut kiagmi kit’ellriamek.
We didn’t hear of anyone getting into misfortune in the summer, anyone drowning.

That’s how I compare it, like scattering them [their lives].

You know, when we scatter things, they scatter, and what we call saltshakers scatter [salt].

Tuarpiaq umyuartequrarqama tuaten tua-i kanvutekluku man’a aturyulallrat.
It truly seems when I ponder that what they abuse makes their [lives] scatter.

And their means of travel back then weren’t big like that. Kayaks were their only means of travel.

354
00:45:22,062 --> 00:45:32,862
Man’a kitak’ cali: waten maa-i niiqurangelriakut qanruyutmek, qanruyutet niitnaunrirniluki.
This one too: now, we always hear that traditional wisdom is not heard anymore.

355
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:39,806
Elpeni cali murilkellerpeni ciin qanruyutet qanruteknanrirpakartatki ciuliamta?
In your observation, why don’t our elders speak about traditional wisdom too much anymore?

356
00:45:39,806 --> 00:45:52,619
Tua-i, tua-i au͡gkut, au͡gkut ciuqlimta, ciuqliput nang’ngata.
It’s because the people back then, there are no more of our elders.

Qanruyutet tamakunek ciuqlimteńek qanrutkestairucata qanrutkestairutut.
Because traditional wisdom had no more of our elders to speak of them, there is no one who speaks of them.

358
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:13,981
Ilaita-llu nallunrit’laryaaqellikait tayima.

Qanruyun ak’allaq niitelaryaaqellikiit.
They probably hear of the ancient traditional wisdom.

360
00:46:21,688 --> 00:46:28,138
Tamaa-i qanrutkurtairucami.
It’s because no one speaks about it anymore.

361
00:46:28,145 --> 00:46:37,957
Atam tamakut tamaa-i angullrenka
Look, the people I was born in time to see

Qalaruyut’seng cimiqetaarpek’naku atauciq tua-i atauciuluku qalarutkuratuat.
They would speak of their instruction without changing it, where one was one and the same [every time].

Uum qalartaqami qanrutkaqluku.
When this person gave instruction, (s)he would speak of it.

Before long, when another gave instruction, (s)he would speak of it.

365
00:46:58,452 --> 00:47:08,602
Tamaa-i tamakunek tegganrurtellrianek qalarutkestairucameng
Because they don’t have those who’ve become elders to speak of them anymore

366

Qanruyun man’a qanrutkuranriraat nang’ngameng tamakut qalarustek’lallri.
They don’t speak about this traditional wisdom because those who spoke of them are almost gone.

Waten, waten cali makut wani ciuliaput waten qanerturalalriit.
Our elders always give instruction like this.

368
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:41,303
Qanerturalalriit-wa. Tuar, tuar qanruyutet pinrillrat ayagyuanun elliluku qanrucunairutniluta.
They give instruction. It seems they place [the blame] on young people, saying that we do not heed advice anymore.

369
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:47,366
Ciin, ciin tamana cali tuaten piularta maa-i?
Why is it like that now?

Niicugnirraarluni tua-i-ll’ ayagluni tua-i unilluku.
After one listens, they go and leave it behind.

374
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:26,724
Tamaa-i tamana umyuaqluku ilaita pilallruut.
Some of them would speak with that in mind.

375
00:48:26,749 --> 00:48:29,562
Maa-i tua-i qanrutkelallrat.
This is what they spoke of.

376

Qanruyun atunrirciqniluku-ll’ wii niigartelallruunga.
I also used to hear that people would stop practicing traditional wisdom.

I used to hear way back in the past that when they have no more instructors that they will stop practicing traditional wisdom.

Now, do you think that what you heard about people not practicing traditional wisdom has come true?

Ii-i, ii-i, piciurtuq tua-i maa-i.
Yes, yes, it’s come true now.

Tang au͡gkut yaaqvaq-llu tekitarkaq nallunrilngurtun pilallrulliniat.
You see, it was like people back then knew the far off future.

381
00:49:15,025 --> 00:49:17,587
Nallunrilngurtun.
It’s like they knew.

382
00:49:23,888 --> 00:49:40,000
Camek wani tua-i paiciryullerpenek wangkuta ayagyuani wall’u niicugnilriani camek alerquutmek paicirluta.
Something that you want to leave with us, what kind of instruction would you leave with us young people or those of us who are listening?

383
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:40,951

I leave with you what I want to leave with you.

386
00:49:48,527 --> 00:50:00,152
Waniwa kenkulluci ayagyualriani, kenkulluci. Ilaci cangayugcetaarpek’naki pisqelluki.
Now, love each other, young people, love each other. Do not offend those around you.

387
00:50:00,183 --> 00:50:05,933
Ilakelriatun ayuqulluci elpeceńi.
Be like a family.

388
00:50:05,965 --> 00:50:21,065
Maa-i tang makut wani iqlutmun ayagarcuukarangelria qanruyutni wall’u cangayullni ayagneqluku.
Now, you see, one easily goes the wrong way when [disobeying] traditional wisdom, or starting from being offended.

389
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:28,859
Ayuqlutek, ayuqlutek arnaunge’rmi tuaten ayuqliriuq.
[Men and woman] the same way, even women have become like that.

390

They go the wrong way when they are offended, go wrong because of that.

391
