"Our religion is good and powerful."

That’s why even if they say other religions are better, don’t believe them.

But for us young people, those first Caucasians were scary.

Qavcin tua-i Kass’at tangerqalaqput.
We’d occassionally see several Caucasians.

Absolutely without [?] them, when they came once in a great while, we’d see Caucasians.

There were those.

They built a school right in the middle of us, then they started going to school.

They said that it starts something mischievous. Now, they said that those schools make them coddled.

Wait, that fell.

65
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,372
Aipaqlian?
Is he your spouse?

66
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:15,642
Qastussiyaallemta pillia.
It might be because we were too loud.

67
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:16,697
Nuu.
No.

68
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:25,642

Then after we tried going to school, since they told us to stay, we went home.

Later, their mischief will have bad outcomes.

They said they’d become foolish far in the future, not thinking of what chores they should be doing

We didn’t go to school, but these poor young people and our children started going to school.

And among them here, among the many pieces of traditional wisdom from our instructors, one who wanted to [cause mischief] was part of the traditional wisdom.

00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:32,087
Ciknayaraq-gguq man’a
They said that jealousy

[S]he places a curse on him to make him unable to catch animals, or destroys the great wealth of one who was going to live well.

When I was a girl here, at night, and since I lost my mother at a young age, because I would stop going out at night when it got dark

86
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:29,987
Akeqnerrluggnauraatnga makut qessamkaukuma tua-i waten kaigasteńguciqnilua.
These people would threaten me that if I were a lazy person, that I would be a begger like this.

Picurlautek’larciqniluku-ll’ tamana qessamkaulua pirraarlua ilanka uingequkata ayuqniam ugaani.
And they said that that [begging] would bring me misfortune after I was lazy when my peers took husbands, out of [my] desire to have things like them.

And among our peers, we shouldn’t misbehave, shouldn’t [? as you know], shouldn’t be inadequately observant, shouldn’t be fooling among our peers.

90
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:09,492
Maktaqameng tua-i qanruqu’urnauraitkut
When they got up, they’d always tell us

91
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:19,352
"Elpeci-ll’ maa-i ayagyuani irniangekuvci-gguq irniarci-gguq mikelnguungalnge’rmi wall’ pilukuvceńi camek inerququvciu
"When you young people have children, though your child seems small, or if you admonish them when you put on their boots

92
00:15:19,357 --> 00:15:24,772
"’Kitak’ at’ ilaten piqaqatgen qimagaqluki ingluliuqina.’
"’Now, if your peers do anything to you, respond by getting away from them.’

Atam-gguq cumikeyagatuut.
They said the little ones pay attention.

They said that these things our elders heard in their earliest memories are theirs [to remember and pass on].

00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:48,657
Maa-i tua-i tamana umyuaqaqamku qunukelalqa-llu tamana akusrarciiqniluki avani
Now, when I remember that, and how I was reluctant to accept that they’d become more mischievous later

96
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:55,602
Qitevcuilama-llu qitevtellrit-llu niicuilamki umyuaqluki.
And since I didn’t speak English, and didn’t hear them speak English, I remembered them.

Irniangamegnuk-ll’ aipangamegnuk
And when we had children, when we got married

Aipaput kenekluki pisqessaaqaqluki, uiput cumikluki.
They told us to treat our spouses with love, take care of our husbands.

Uimta-llu nalluatni arnaurlulriani wangkuta ayagallerkartuyarrluta
And if we poor woman go to various places without our husbands’ knowledge

They said that eventually, we’d become pregnant with someone other than our husbands.

Imkut maaten tamaani ellangeqarraallemteńi qanrutaqamegtekut iki’uk’acagangraan ca ikuggluku qanrutnauraitkut.
Back when in our childhoods, we found that when they instructed us, no matter how socially unacceptable it was, they’d pry it out and tell us.

103
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:43,332
Tangvagluta-ll’ piaqatkut waten umyuarteqsaaqnaurtukut wangkuta niicugnilriani:
And when they looked at us, we who were listening would think like this:

104
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:48,852
"Aling, ik’um-am cunaw’ nallunrilkiikut, tangellrukiikut."
"Oh my, it turns out the one across know knows us, has seen us."

105
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:53,792
Tuar tang nallunritkacagarluta, ilumun tangellruluta pilaqaitkut.
It seemed they knew everything about us, like they’d indeed seen us.

106
00:16:54,887 --> 00:17:01,482
Cunaw’ tamakut qanruciyupialriit ircaqurteng cairluteng ellaita atullmeggnek.
It turned out that those who instructed well would empty their heard of what they’d experienced.

107
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:07,662
Assirluku yuk agesqelluku qanruturlularyaaqellinikaitkut.
The dear ones would instruct us, wanting a person to go [through life] well.

108
00:17:07,662 --> 00:17:15,682
Irniau͡rluput-llu waten makut irniaqsagutaqamteki angurrluk’ tua-i agutevkenaki.
And when we bear children, they told us never to bring them to various places [with people].

109
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:22,062
Tass’uqluki-ll’ enenun allanun ceńirtaaruqu’urqata assiiruturlurniartut.
And if we hold their hands to visit other houses with them, the dear ones will become bad.

110
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:30,162
Ikiurlullrat man’a arrsaurlullerqut ilalqerluku-gguq atam aanaulriami enem nayurtiini.
They say their improper behavior exacerbates a mother’s destitution who looks after the home.

111
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:35,322
Una-wa-gguq aatavut ayagalria pikangengnaqluta.
They said our household’s father would travel to try to provide for us.

112
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:42,742
Pitarra’urlui-gguq tekitaqan quyatekluki ciuniurluki arnaulriani.
They said that when he arrives, we women should be thankful for whatever he catches.

113
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:52,937
Wall’ akirrarmek unangekan qenngevkenata wangkuta arnani taqmakegciyugluta wall’ camek cap’akiqegciyugluta.
Or if he earns a little money, we women shouldn’t be angry wanting beautiful dresses or some beautiful shoes.

114
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:58,647
Aturaqegciamta-gguq tua-i, pikarciaritnek maa-i nangerngiimta.
They said it’s because we have nice clothes, because we’re standing with what they provided.

115
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:05,387
Tamakut-gguq navguutekai taum, aipamteńun.
They say those will destroy our spouses.

116
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:16,037
Tamakut unangkengarait, uiu͡rlumta unangkengarait munarulluki-gguq munarcallrani tauna aipa’urluput ukisqirluki.
What little they obtain, they said we should be dextrous with what little they obtain, helping our dear spouses.

117
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:19,807
Tamakut tamaa-i anglanitekevkenaki-gguq.
They said not to be frivolous with them.

118
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,162
Akingutaurluinek tegulerulluta ayagpek’nata.
We shouldn’t grab what money he made and go.

119
00:18:23,162 --> 00:18:30,352
Avani-ll’ ayainanemteńi canun akusrarrnarqelrianun tekiskumta wall’ mer’aluta wall’ canek
And later as we go, if we come across mischievous things, or we drink, or other things

120
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:41,112
Inerqurluta tua-i tamalkuita tamakunek aarnarqellriamek irniamta takuatni tuaten ayuqesqevkenata. Alerquaciqaput-gguq.
They admonished us against all of those dangerous things, not to be like that in front of our children. They said we’d teach them [how to be like that].

121
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:47,327
Cunaw’ imna anguyagteńun ayagangaqameng, tan’gaurlurugaumeng-ll’ irniapuk
It turned out that when they got enlisted en masse, and since we have a lot of male children

122
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:53,057
Tua-i umyuaq una navgurluku yuungaqluta [?meryuu]llermegteggun maaggun.
We start living with a hopeless mindset because they [?tended to drink].

Tua-i tuaten tau͡gaam ilalqerpek’nani yuk yuurluqili mat’um nalliini.
May a person live like that without exacerbating anything these days.

124
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:05,762
Tamana-llu tamaa-i akerrneqlugutek’lallrat
And their warning of a terrible ending

125
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:13,477
Akusrangkumta-gguq, tamakut angayuqamta, qanrutestemta, ciulirnemta qanrutaqamegtekut
They said that if we start being mischievous, when our parents, instructors, and elders instructed us

126
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:17,972
Akusrangkumta-gguq camek elpek[’ngaaru]lluta.
They said that if we become mischievous, we [won’t] be sensible anymore.

127
00:19:17,972 --> 00:19:27,662
Qanrutestevvut cumikenrirluku, alerquastevvut elluarrluta yuusqelluta aviranaunata ilamta akuliitni.
We don’t pay any more attention to our advisor, our instructor, who tells us to live right, without being a hindrance among those around us.

128
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:37,652
Tau͡gaam-gguq assirluta tangniqluta enemteńi aqumluta, enevut-gguq uitanqegcinaqniartuq.
Instead, they said that we would do well to look presentable sitting at home, so, they said, that our home would be peaceful.

129
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:47,752
Allaneruaraam-llu nanikualriim itervikekakut uitanqegcivkangnaqluku im’uvkenata, akusrartevkenata yuukumta.
And if some guest who feels helpless comes in, we should make them feel at peace if we don’t, you know, live mischievously.

130
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:58,452
Tua-i tuaten qanraqata piyugyaaqengramta, amta-llu tua-i iliini canun tekitengaqluta tua-i.
When they said that, though we wanted to [be like that], yet we’d sometimes come across [extrenuating] circumstances.

131
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:03,612
Assiryugyaaqellerput man'a ukatairluku.
We're unsuccessful when we wanted to be good.

132
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:11,112
Ukut-llu maa-i waten makutgun qanruciarkanek kepqengata
And because these people are now in great need of instructors like this

Ayagyuat makut wani kinguqliput maa-i mat’um nalliini yuut amlleriata alerquatmek niicungata
These young people, our descendants, because there’s now a lot of people who want to hear traditional instructions

Taumek tang tua-i capqerqelaqeka.
That’s why I’m daunted by it.

When we’re grown like this, we’re supposed to listen well to their traditional wisdom.

I’ve already started through here on KYUK, with those who are instructing, and those women giving traditional instruction.

Tamakut-llu tamaa-i arnat uingit[lermeggni] taur caunrilkellermegteggu ciisqurrilitaqluki.
And those, when women didn’t have husbands, when they didn’t think anything of it, it was their kneeguards.

138
00:20:54,367 --> 00:21:01,737
Tamaaggun ayuqenrilngurnek-llu irniangeksaunata, uiu͡rlurput tau͡gaam nakmiillarput.
Through that, we didn’t have children with various [fathers], except through our very own dear husbands.

139

Aipamta-gguq tau͡gaam tamakunek irniarinek irniarluta canek allatarnek ilayuunaki.
They said we should have our spouses’ children without adding any from other [people].

And the thought of becoming pregnant at a young age was very scary, bringing forth a child.

Aatailnguut tallurnaqkacagarluteng-gguq. Inerquutnguyaaqluni.
They said children out of wedlock were very embarrassing. It had been an admonishment.

Maa-i tamatuullinill’ akusrangllerkaatnek qanlallrat imkut au͡gkut ciuliamta.
Apparently, that was how they’d become mischievous as our ancestors talked about.

Tamana tamaa-i alerquuterpaksaaqekiit maa-i.
That is an important instruction they have now.

If some rowdy person came upon them, it seemed that they wouldn’t have the strength [to apprehend them].

Young people, it’ll be good if you don’t do these bad things that are admonished against.

Don’t follow what Caucasians tell you to do too much.

Only when they absolutely want me to, and when my spouse across there comes with me, I take something when he comes with me, because I know nothing of how to buy it.
