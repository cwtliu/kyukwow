97
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:59,325
"Nulirtuqsailnguq yun’erra’ar tan’gaurluq anuqiin asguakun agurrluk’ kituryaqunaku, waten avaggun tau͡gaam uqrakun.
"Never pass an unmarried young man, a boy, upwind from him, but over there downwind like this.

98
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:09,880
"Tepen-gguq atam narluku narumangniaraa. Assiiruyutekaa-gguq kiituan."
"If he smells your emanations, he will get addicted to it. Eventually, it will ruin him."

99
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,740
Tuaten-qaa qanrucuitellruatgen? (Qanrutaqluta.)
Would they tell you that? (They would tell us.)

100
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,540
Au͡gna-q’ elitaqenritan?
Don’t you recognize that?

101
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,660
Qang’a, elitaqkacagarluku.
No, I recognize it completely.

102
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:22,935
Tepii-gguq narluku.
They say he smells her emanations.

103
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:36,295
Tua-ll’ waniwa mat’umek ak’allarmek-llu ayuqucirtuutmek qanqaasqaqatnga umyuamkun kiulartua
Then now, when they tell me to speak about old traditional instructions, I reply in my mind

104
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:46,250
"Kingurautuq man’a ayuqucirtuutellerput wangkuta avani Kass’artangvailgan. Kingurautuq."
"Our traditional instruction back before Western contact is late. It’s late."

105
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:58,075
Makut tang tua-i tangvallrenka makut eyinqigutet ayagyuat Kass’at tau͡gaam mat’umun tua-i yuungnaquciatnun ekelriit.
You see, the young children of the next generation that I see are now getting into the Western way of life.

106
00:15:59,515 --> 00:16:12,465
Man’a-llu Yupiit ellangutait aanameng aatameng-llu qaneryaraat Yugtaq language-aaq man’ Kass’at apqiit temciqutaqluku tua-i.
They also make fun of the Yupik language that Yupiit, their mothers and fathers, grew up with, what they call a language in English.

107
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:16,995
Qitevterrlainaryaraq tau͡gaam cucuyagulluku tua-i.
Instead, they choose to speak only in English.

108
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:27,305
Taumek man’a maa-i ayuqucirturillerkaqa ayuqucirtuutellemteńek au͡gkunek qalartellerkaqa
That’s why when I should be instructing on our traditional instructions, and speaking on them

109
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:36,185
Kingurausngaluku tua-i umyuartequsngakeka. Tengrukevkenaku-llu ayuqucirtuutekelqa.
I started thinking that it’s too late. Neither am I excited to teach what I was instructed.

110
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:44,990
Yuum iliin niicugnirraarlua uluqunia pegciiqngaku tamana qanemcikelqa qigcikevkenaku.
Because after some people listen to me, if he looks away, he will drop it without respecting my stories.

111
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,790
Kass’aq tau͡gaam tangerquniu nutaan ayuqucilinqiggluni quuyurmi qitevvluni ullagciqaa.
But when he sees a Caucasian, he will change, smile, and go to him speaking English.

112
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,550
Ayuqucirtuutellrenka-ll’ au͡gkut nalluyagulluki tua-i umyuaqevkenaki.
And he forgets what I instructed, does not remember them.

113
00:16:57,165 --> 00:17:10,605
Wangkuta tau͡gken au͡gkut ava-i qanrutkelput egmianun-gguq camek akikuine’rmek melqulegmek tegumiangekumta kiturcequavkenaku.
But what we were told was that if we come into possession of fur that is worth some money, not to let it pass by.

114
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Qemangqauraqaqerlaut-gguq ilangnercirluku.
They said that we should keep it until there’s more.

115
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:27,285
Atam-gguq ilangekuni nutaan tunkumteggu carrarnek amllernek ikayuutekamtek unangutekniarput.
They said that if there’s more and we sell a lot of even little things, we will get helpful things from them.

116
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,890
Wall’u qanrutaanga au͡g’um caqerlua ap’ama iliita
Or, one time, one of my grandfathers said to me

117
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:41,635
"Kitak’ maklaarcaureskuvet atam kiturceterrlainarpek’naki atam.
"Now, when you start hunting seals, do not keep letting them pass you by.

118
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:51,210
"Amirkaq atauciq qemangqaurquvgu atam piinanermini ilangluni, kiituan qayarkanrurciiquq."
"If you keep even one hide, there will come more, until eventually you have enough to make a kayak."

119
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,650
Watuam nalliini imarmiutaat akikeggiameng
Since mink skins are worth less these days

120
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:09,100
Imarmiutaat tau͡gaam melqulget akiitgun kipusvigmi amirkat tua-i qacignariluteng melqulegnek nav’errluki.
It’s become easy to trade mink skins in stores, trading in fur.

121
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:13,935
Alqunaq tua-i qayarkanrurpallagaqluteng tua-i.
They suddenly get enough for kayaks.

122
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:26,710
Mat’umek maa-i qayartangnanrirluteng au͡g’umek ciuliartarmek qalartellerkaqa tengrukenri’rqa.
Since they’ve stopped using kayaks, I am no longer excited to talk about our ancestors’ ways.

123
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:34,420
Tangvagluku makut, ukut-llu wii ayuqucirtuq’nganka irnianka tua-i
Watching these, including my children whom I instruct

124
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:47,740
Irniama tuar waniw’ ukut qetunrama ayuqucirtuutet tamakut ayuqucirturiyaaqaqama piksaileng’e’rmeng tailuteng tuar qanqa patulaqiit.
When I teach those traditional instructions, even though my children, my sons, do not [physically] do it, it seems they come and close my mouth.

125
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:59,710
Au͡gna ayuqucirtuutnek maligtaquingnaqelqa ayuqelinripakaatgu ukut irniama tua-i alerquaqengama.
It’s because my children whom I teach do not follow those traditional teachings.

126
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,945
Tamaa-i tamana puqialutekluku.
That’s why I feel inarticulate.

127
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:12,645
Ciuliartarmek ayuqucirturiyung’e’rma tua-i mat’umek Kass’at apqiitnek late-aartuq.
Though I want teach our ancestors ways, it is late, as they say in English.

128
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:23,415
Tutgaraanka-ll’ ukut iliini quyungqaqa’arqata ayuqucirturraarluki aptelaranka, "Au͡gna-qaa ayuqucirtulqa taringarci?"
And sometimes, after I teach my grandchildren when they’re gathered, I ask them, "Do you understand my instruction?"

129
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:33,985
"Ung’alu," taringenritaatnga-gguq Yugtun qalarulluki ayuqucirtuutelput.
"Ung’alu," they say they didn’t understand what I had been taught when I speak to them in Yup’ik.

130
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:39,905
Tua-i tang qanelngulrianga. Waten pitaqatartua.
Well, I’m tired of speaking. This is all I’ll say.

131
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:47,635
KYUK-t kiugkut qanemcilriit cangirnaqluteng qavcirrarnek Yup’igtun qanqalartut.
I want more when they tell a few stories upriver in KYUK in Yup’ik.
