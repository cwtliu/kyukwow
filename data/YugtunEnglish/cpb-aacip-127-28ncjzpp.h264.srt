1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:06,330
Uskumi unisteka maliggluku ayallemegni yuilqumun nengllirluku
In the winter, when I went with my late father to the wilderness when it was cold

2
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:09,873
Qercuallinilua, wiinga-ll’ nalluluku.
I got frostbitten and I didn’t realize it.

3
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:12,794
Tangrramia qercualliinianga-gguq ulluviigemkun.
When he saw me, he said that my cheeks got frostbitten.

4
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:23,624
Qanikcarmek tamaaken tegulluni patgumallrua negingalukek ulluviigka taukuk qanikcaq-ll’ urugluku.
He took snow from there, pressed it against my cheeks, and the snow melted.

5
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:29,296
Tua-i qaill’ pitarian tayima taq’ak.
When it had been some time, he stopped.

6
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:37,667
Taukuk-llu tua-i imkucirpek’natek ulluviigka, amia au͡g’arpek’nani.
And then the skin from my cheeks didn’t, you know, peel off.

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,864
Tua-i tau͡gaam tuaten nallunritaqa tuana tuaten pillra.
But that’s what I know about how that happens.

8
00:00:44,465 --> 00:00:52,165
Tayima tau͡gaam qaillun it’gamegteggun unatemeggteggun-llu pikuneng kumlamun akungqakuneng assiryarngatut.
But I think it would be good to be submerged into cold water if they get frostbitten on their feet or hands.

9
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:57,168
Cangallrungaicugnarqut maaggun ulluviignegun pilleq.
It probably won’t be any different from getting it here on the cheeks.

10
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:06,710
Cangallrungaicugnarqut unatetgun it’gatgun-llu qercuakuni kumlamun akungqakuneng.
It probably won’t be any different if they get frostbitten on their hands or feet and they are submerged into cold water.

11
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:12,484
Akungqakata assirciqngatut aipaagni.
They will probably be good if they are submerged.

12
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,084
Nenglliqerciqnilaraat tuaten piaqan.
They say it will suddenly get cold when that happens.

13
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:37,028
Pinaunqumanilaraat akerta nenglliqata’rqan.
They say that the sun is "ready" when it’s going to be cold.

14
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:43,456
Nenglli’rqan-wa tua-i nenglliqata’rqan tuaten ayuqetunilallruat.
When it’s cold, when it’s going to get cold, that’s what they said it was like.

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:54,494
Imutun pugyaralirtun ayuqluni avatailiterluni, cali-ll’ elaqvaggun cali aliimaterluni, qatellriartarluni.
It would be as if it were wearing an outer parka, and wearing gloves on the outside with white parts.

16
00:01:55,931 --> 00:02:04,669
Tua-i-gguq-qaa nengllircuuciqluni. Tuaten nenglliqata’rqan-llu, nengllirturaqerkaugaqan-wa tua-i pitullilria.
They said that it will get cold. That probably happens when it’s going to be cold for a while.

17
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:05,873
Ak’anun?
For a long time?

18
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:13,205
Tuaten ayuqetungatuq. Tuatnatuniluku tua-i qanrutketullruat.
I think it's like that. They said that it would be like that.

19
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:17,276
Ingrit-llu-ggem qaillun ellassuutekluki qanrutek'larait.
Don't they also say that they would use the mountains for weather forecasts?

20
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:22,842
Ingrit cali tua-i qaillun murilketalriit tamaa-i ilaita
The mountains also, since some of them were observant

21

Wiinga murilketailama, ingrit agkut caqtaaraqata-wa tua-i inimaaqluki-llu piaqata
Because I'm not observant, when those mountains across there do something, when there are mirages on the horizon

22
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:38,383
Cassuutnguniluki caqatarniluki tua-i pilaraat.
They say that it's a sign of some kind of weather.

23
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:50,133
Tau͡gaam qertuaqameng agkut ingrit cingikeggluni-ll’ ilait qulmun nenglaitessuutnguyugnarquq tamana.
But when the mountains across are high, and some of them have sharp summits, I think that’s a sign of warm weather.

24
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:38,277
Wiinga ikna ingriq ikani, wii ikna ingriq ikani cingikellria tau͡gken cingiani cingikeggluni tangl’arqa, maaken-ll’ alaitetuluni.
I see the mountain across there with the sharp summit, and it’s visible from here.

25
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:46,292
Avaken-llu pikani Qanirtuum Qagatiini uitalallemni alaunani tuaken cingikeggluni.
And when I used to live up in Qanirtuum Qagatii over there, it would be visible with a sharp summit.

26
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:52,239
Tauna tua-i nenglaiteqata’rqan nenglaitessuutekaqa.
When it’s going to be warm, I use it as a sign.

27
00:03:52,581 --> 00:04:01,319
Qulmun cingikeggiluni waten mayurluni caqtaarluni piaqan, tua-i nenglairutqata’arqan tuatnangatelartuq.
When the summit seems to get sharper and rise acting strangely, it seems to do that when it’s going to get warm.

28
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:15,055
Murilketalriit tamaa-i nallunrit’lallruat tamaani yaaqvani ciuqliit au͡gkut yullret.
The observant ones back then would know, the people of old back then.

Catgun-wa tua-i pingnatugatullermeggni ellameturpallurluteng pitullruameng
When they used to survive with various tools, because they were always outside

30
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:29,663
Unugmi-llu cat nallunailkurluki agyat-llu pitustait tamakut nallunritaat.
And those who use them know to use the stars at night as signs of incoming weather.

31
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:34,522
Maa-i tua-i tuatnalriartangqessuirutlilria tayima.
There is probably no one who does that now.

32
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:41,791
Naamelliin. Nallunarqellriit ayagyuat ilait qanrutellrit tuatnatuyugngallilriit tayima.
I’m not sure. Some young people who were told can probably do that.

33
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:12,172
Tua-i ilumun ellaliurtetun ayuqellrulliniut tamakut murilketalriit.
Those observant ones were indeed like weather forecasters.

They knew through their signs, how they gauged the signs

35
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:22,657
Agyatgun wall’u ellam qaillun waten ayuqellrakun.
Through the stars or how the weather was like.

They knew what the weather was going to be like.

37
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:33,536

Some of those who believed in them would follow them.

Tua-i-ll’ cali imkut ingrini agaani qangaanaat cali au͡g’um iliita qanemcitellruanga
And then the squirrels in the mountains across there, one of them also told me a story

39
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:49,840
Waten-gguq ellarayakata’arqan akaarnun ella assiiteqata’rqan iqrit ukut imartutuut.
He said that when the weather is going to be bad for a long while, their cheeks have a lot in them.

40
00:05:50,736 --> 00:06:01,086

They fill them with berries or other things they eat, go to their dens, then eat from the stores in their cheeks for as long as the weather is bad.

Neqerluteng tuani igteḿi uitaurluteng.
They stay there in the den with food.

42
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,105

I had a storyknive made out of ivory, tuluq, ivory.

44
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:30,620

I would never stop telling storyknife stories.

And since we had friends, we would only tell storyknife stories with our friends when we weren’t in school.

47

Yaaruinaurtukut yaaruiraput-llu wangkuk friend-aqa-llu aterluteng, taukut nunat.
We would tell storyknife stories, and the villages from my friend’s and my storyknife stories would have names.

I grew up at the time without a lot of Caucasians here between Aagurmiut and Urucuaraq.

Cali wiinga tamaa-i tuaten qanrucimalallrulua, mom-amnek-llu qanrucimalallrulua.
That’s what I used to be told, and that’s what my mother told me.

Tua-i-llu waten mikelnguut ciunermeggnun tamakut inerquumaaqameng anagyaaqevkenateng-llu taqtulliniut tua-i taqesqellriani.
And then when children are admonished like this for the benefit of their futures, it turns out they do not run away but stop when they are told to.

223
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:34,042
Waten-llu pivkenaki: "Piciqaqa tauna."
And do not say this to them: "I will take care of him."

Taumek wani inerquutngullinilria iqluyaramun qannguaryaramun-llu agarutnguniluku tamana.
That’s why it’s admonished against, because it leads to lying and saying things without consideration.

227
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:31,259
Makut-llu tangllerrlugnarqellriit-wa tua-i makut pisciigalnguut-llu ikayuasqelluki pitullruitkut.
They also told us to help those who looked destitute and who were unable.

Also, even if we enter another house, my teacher would tell me to never take even a single match or nail from that house.

233
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:14,060
Qaillun pitaa?
How much more time?

He also said that even in the wilderness, a person doesn’t forget what he put, even in the wilderness.

When our feet were itchy at night, we would take out our feet to our bedding and they would start bleeding.

When we went to the wilderness, we would pull something out and bandage the part that was bleeding too much.
