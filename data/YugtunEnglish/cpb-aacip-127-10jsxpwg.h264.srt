These days, since we’ve recently gotten this [religion],
this is how I think when I pick berries.

99
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,000
Tamatum nalliini yaqulget amllepiatullrulriit.
At that time, there were a great many birds.

But what they caught, because salt came early in our time

104
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,500
Tamakut tua-i yaqulget sulunatullruaput assiirpailgata.
We would preserve those birds with salt before they spoiled.

Makut-llu qangqiiret agarrluki kinercirluki kemgit.

107
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,500

00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:01,400
Arutulinek, arutulinek kuvyangqellruamta tamaani

Because we had nets and deteriorated back then
that needed to be replaced every year

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:08,300
Ilii pisciigataqluni, unangesciiganani neqmek amllermek.
Sometimes, it couldn’t catch a lot of fish.

Qangqiirnek ciumek pilaamta negartura’arluki tau͡gaam

Because we hunted ptarmigans first, we would trap ptarmigans
with snares made from twine.

112
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Tua-i tuaten pitullruluta amllellruameng tamatum nalliini
We used to do that because there were a lot back then
