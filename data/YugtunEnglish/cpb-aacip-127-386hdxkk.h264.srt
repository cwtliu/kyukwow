Please start talking about how people, you, moved here to Atmauthluak again.

And when, what year, did you move here?

Then in one year in ’71, I moved here.

A person, it’s because a person, we Yupiit, historically only to places where there is fish since a long time ago.

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,940
Ciuliamteńek-wa tua-i ayagluta neqnek nertuamta.
It’s because we’ve always eaten fish starting from our ancestors.

7
00:00:54,175 --> 00:01:00,005
Nervikluku man’a wani, nervigkaqluku upagallrulliniut.
So they moved to get food from here.

8
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:01,065

Yes.

Yes, had we not moved, the people of Nunpitchuk across there would have nowhere to be now.

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,640
Tayima wangkuta ceńami uitalartukut.
We live on the coast.

11
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:28,115
Ceńami-llu tayima yuilqumun ayalriit alerquukarangqelartut
And on the coast, those who go to the wilderness have traditional instructions

12
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:32,735
Wall’u imarpigmun aya’agqameng imarpigmi alerquukararluteng.
Or when they go to the ocean, they have traditional instructions in the ocean.

13
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:46,899
Qaillun maani tua-i-w’ yuilquqvani elpeci anglillerpeni maani qaillun ciuliarpet alerqualallruatgen ayagayaurtellerpeni?
How, here as you grew up here deep in the wilderness, how did your elders instruct you when you started traveling?

14
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:53,894
Aknirtenritlerkan wall’u qaill’ tua-i pinritlerkarpenun alerqualallruatgen?
How did they instruct you so you wouldn’t get hurt, or so nothing would happen to you?

15
00:01:53,902 --> 00:02:05,042
Alerquutengqellruukut imumi ayagyuarluta arcaqerluku qanikciurun wall’u cikuliurun, ayaruq.
We had traditinional instruction back when we were young, especially [to take] a shovel or ice pick, a walking staff.

16
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:11,587
Ayaruq-llu tamana qanrutketullruat unguvauniluku yugmun.
They also talked about that staff, saying it is life for a person.

17
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:19,402
Cali-llu waniw' ukut arcaqerluki alerquutektullrit:
These are also the important things they instructed:

18
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:33,627
Tua-i-w' imarnitet wangkuta Yugcetun au͡gkut avani makunek Kass’artartnek pingvailegmeng tamakut tua-i tamaa-i imarnitet atutullrulliniit.
Those seal gut rain parkas, we Yupiit, back before these Western things came, they used to use those seal gut rain parkas.

19
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:39,637
Tua-i-llu wangkuta Kass’angumariluku maa-i yuurtellriani
Then for us who were born after Caucasians had come

20
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:52,282
Angayuqamta alerqutullruitkut tua-i tamakut tua-i tamaa-i ellalliurcuutet arcaqerluki qelkesqelluki wangkutnun ella assirngalengraan.
Our parents used to instruct us to especially keep those rainproof clothes with us even if the weather seems good.

21
00:02:54,357 --> 00:03:01,827
Tua-i iliini waten iquklicuilan ella up’nerkami wall’u uksuarmi
Because sometimes, the weather doesn’t relent like this in the spring or fall

22
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:12,037
Tua-i taukut tua-i tamaa-i arcaqerluki wangkutnun avaliqesqelluki pitullruit.
Those were the things that they especially told us to have with us.

23
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:21,157
Tua-i ayarumek piilkumta tua-i qaillun nalluciqngamteggu-wa tua-i cam-llu aarnarqucia nalluluku.
Because if we don’t have a staff, we won’t know things, and we won’t know that something is dangerous.

24
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:32,982
Wall’u uksumi ayagaqamta qanikciurun ucikerrlainarluku cali ella assingraan pisqelluta.
Or, they also told us that when we travel in the winter, to always have a shovel in our cargo even if the weather is good.

25

Arenqiallugeskumta cunawa yuilqumi wall’u pirtunguskakut, ellaqerruskakut tua-i cali alerquutekluku
If we get into misfortune, it turns out, in the wilderness, or if a blizzard his us, or the weather changes on us, they also instructed

00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:50,542
Agnermun, agellranun-wa tua-i arulairesqevkenata.
They told us not to stop at a small snowbank.

27
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:58,392
Tau͡gaam-llu tua-i camek kangiciramek-llu piilkumta qanikciurutengqerqumta
But also, if we have no tarpaulin, if we have a shovel

28
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:04,782
Qengaruk, ak’a qengaruurtelleq tauna elagluku.
A snowbank, dig into an already formed snowbank.

29
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:16,272
Iluani tua-i tuani uitasqelluta tau͡gaam cali muragmek kapsuutekaanek tauna piluku.
They told us to stay inside of it, but to also get a piece of wood to poke [the ceiling].

30
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:21,532
Kiiriaqan kapurluku elcetaqluku.
When it gets hot, poke it to ventilate it.

31
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:32,552
Tua-i tamaa-i tamakut arcaqerluki wangkuta alerquutekellruaput au͡gkunun-wa tua-i ciuliamteńun.
Those were our important traditional instruction from our elders.

32

Cali-llu tua-i-wa ayagyuamteńun makunun waniw’ tua-i quyatekngamku alerquutekqeryuumiryaaqaqa cali atauciq.
Also, since I am thankful for it, I want to give one quick traditional instruction to our youth.

33
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:58,038
Tua-i cali wii aipangqerraallemni, tua-i-w’ aipanglua
Also, when I got married, when I got married

Wall’ irnianglua-llu atama au͡g’um mulngakevkenii qanrutetullruamia tua-i tamaa-i tamaani
Or when I also had children, since my father wouldn’t hold back when advising me back then

35
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:15,778
Qalarut’lallruanga waten: mikelnguq irniangekumegnuk pitsaqevkenanuk
He used to speak to me like this: a child, should we have children

36
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:27,821
Qialuni itengraan apqauresqevkenaku wall’u qaillun picianek kitumun-llu picianek aptesqev[kenaku].
Even if [s]he comes in crying that we shouldn’t as questions, or ask what’s wrong or who did it.

37
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:31,507
Tua-i-wa eyurnakluku pisqevkenaku.
He said not to be defensive over them.

38
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:40,741
Atam-gguq eyurnakluku pilaqumegnegu taum mikelngucuaraam ukvercugngariniaraakuk.
Watch, he said, if we defend them, that little child will be able to make us believe [anything].

39
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:47,019
Ayainanmegni yugnikek’ngamegnun umyuarpuk assiicecugngarivkarluku.
As we go, [s]he can make us upset with our friends.

40
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:54,922
Tua-i-llu cali pinarikuni cali maa-i-llu elitnaungelriit
Then when it’s time for him, since they’ve also started going to school

41
00:05:55,903 --> 00:06:00,994
Inerqulangraatni-gguq yuut niicuiciiquq.
He said that even if people admonish them, [s]he will not obey.

42
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:05,495
Tua-i-gguq-wa wangkugnek eyurtekangqerrami.
He said it’s because [s]he has us to defend them.

43
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:17,329
Tua-i tamaa-i tamana arcaqerluku qanrutkeqeryuumiamku quyatekngamku tua-i taiqallertek qanrutkartaqa.
Since I especially yearned to say that because I'm thankful that you came, I spoke about it.

44
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:27,836
Maa-i, maa-i cali kit'ellriit, kit'ellriit kiagmi amlleringut.
Now, those who drown, there are now a lot who drown in the summer.

45
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:38,748
Ciungani-mi tua-i... amllerrniluki, niitaqlua-llu kanvelriatun maa-i ernemteńi ayuqniluta kuigkun.
What about in the past... they say there’s a lot, and I hear that it’s like we’re dying in great numbesr in our day through the river.

46
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:52,503
Qaillun cali ayagatuli tan’gaurluut wall’u tayima allat-llu alerquayugngasiki tuatnanritlerkaatnek?
What can you instruct those who travel, boys or others, so that they wouldn’t do that?

47
00:06:52,721 --> 00:07:03,948
Yaa, mat’umun-wa tua͡gaam qanrutkelallratnun arcaqerluku tua-i maa-i mat’umek piitqapigtellrunricaaqut.
Yes, especially what they said about this, they weren’t actually completely without it.

48
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,542
Wangkuta imumi yuurtellemteńi Kass’angumariluku yuurtellruamta
Back when we were born, because we were born when there’d been Caucasians

49
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:15,172
Tau͡gaam makunek massiinangellrata-llu cukalrianek
But having gotten these fast boat motors

50
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:27,464
Tamaa-i tamatum arcaqerluki, ayagassuutetgun-wa tua-i makugtun pingellrata arcaqerluki yuut kanvelriacetun pingevkarait.
Those especially, starting to use these vehicles especially is what’s causing people to die in great numbers.

51
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:36,243
Cali-ll’ mat’umek usviitnarqellriamek tamaa-i atullrata tuaten pivkallii.
And abusing this mind-altering substance is probably what’s making do that.

52
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:44,803
Imumi tua-i nallemni-llu wii Mamterillerni kanani kipusviit-llu tamarmeng taangiviullruyaaqut.
Long ago, and in my time, all of the stores down in Bethel were all liquor stores.

53
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:56,268
Tau͡gaam elluatumek ayagassuutaitellruameng tamaani tuaten tua-i pilange’rmeng nallunallruut.
But since they didn’t have sophisticated vehicles back then, though they [drank] like that, they didn’t know [of people dying a lot].

54
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:07,126
Tua-i maa-i alerqualaryaaqaput makut irniaput, tua-i wiinga-ll’ ukut irnianka tua-i qalarutaqluki
Now, we do instruct our children, and I also advise my children

55
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:13,121
Tau͡gaam watuam nalliini tuacetun, wiinga-llu angayuqamtun
But these days like that, and me, like my parents

56
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:18,980
Tua-i-wa unisteka au͡gna tangvallruyaaqaqa wangnek-llu
I used to watch my late father and myself

57
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:25,580
Tau͡gaam tuacetuqapiar maa-i pisciigatanka elliitun.
But I cannot [instruct] them exactly like he did.

58
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:36,555
Tua-i-wa cangayullerkaat wiinga pitekluku wall’u iqlutmuqertellerkaat pitekluku piyaaqellrianga. Cunaw’ wiinga alarrlua.
I did that because they may feel offended or may go in the wrong direction. It turned out I made a mistake.

59
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:48,462
Yaa, tua-i kenkekumki waten aarnarqellria tamalkuan mulngakevkenaki tua-i qalarutarkauyaaqellinianka
Yes, if I love them, I must not hold back speaking about everything dangerous like this

60
00:08:48,468 --> 00:08:52,159
Tua-i umyuaqellarkaat tau͡gaam ellaita pitekluku.
So that they will remember them.

61
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:55,279
Tua-i maa-i amllermi nallunri...
Now, [unspecified] know[s] many times...

Those who [?break apart] their parents evidently do not live well.

Cali-llu qanruyuteteng atunrilkait ellaita tua-i waten tua-i cailkamun ellilriacetun ayuqaqluteng.
Also, those who don’t follow the traditional wisdom passed down to them like this, are like those who’ve ended up on the ground.

64
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:19,800
Cali-llu niitessaanrilnge’rmi nunanek allanek
Also, though [s]he tried not to be heard of in other villages

65
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:28,204
Napartem kangrani arulalriacetun tauna yuk ayuqaqluni qanruyutni atunritaqamiu.
That person is like something waving on top of a pole when [s]he doesn’t follow their traditional wisdom.

66

Tau͡gken imna qanruyutmi aturtii catailngurcetun, nunaqliq’ng’e’rmi-llu maani catailngurcetun ayuqluni.
However, one who follows their traditional wisdom seems absent, and they seem absent even here in neighboring villages.

67
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:47,148
Nangnermek, tayima qaillun elpet Fred Pavilla
Lastly, how would you, Fred Pavilla

68
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:56,633

Something important that you want to leave the next generations

Elpeni tua-i camek wangkuta pitsaqa’artevkenata tayima kinguvni anerteqkumta, anerteqellriani, anerteqarkani
What would you [pass on] to us, should we, by happenstance, live after you, who do live, who will live

70

Qaillun alerquayugngasikut? Camek paitarkicugngasikut elpet?
How can you instruct us? What can you leave with us?

I can leave with you young people

72
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:25,515

Like this, no matter what a person is like, even if they’re bad, socialize with them

Wall’u pikailkuvci tua-i tuaten tua-i qanrrarpeciuggun, wall’u pikangqerquvci nerevkarluku.
Or if you have none, offer a small conversation like that, or if you have some, feed them.

Qaillun-wa tua-i yuk ayuqengraan, ayuqngalengraan tamamta yugni assiilamta maani nunam qaingani.
It’s because no matter what a person is like, what they seem like, all of us people are faulty here on this earth.

One who lives socializing like that, one who lives treating everyone they see with love.

Tamaa-i tua-i tamana arcaqerluku wii alerquutekellruaqa au͡gkunun angayuqaagemnun.
That was my most important traditional instruction from my parents.

Qaillun ayuqellria, wall’u elliraulria, wall’u elliraunrilengraan ayuqluku yuk arenqiallugtellria wangnun ikayuusqelluku.
No matter what one is like, or an orphan, or even if [s]he’s not an orphan, they told me to help a person in misfortune all the same.

83
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:49,696
