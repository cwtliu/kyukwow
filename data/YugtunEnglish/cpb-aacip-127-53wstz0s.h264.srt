00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,390
Yaa.
Yes.

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,550
Okay.
Okay.

3
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:16,905
Ready? Okay.
Ready? Okay.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,090
Imguuq, Martha H. Jackson, Kuiggluk.
Imguuq, Martha H. Jackson, Kwethluk.

5
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:25,685
Nunakenrilengramku.
Even though I’m not originally from there.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,930
Camiungusit nutem?
Where are you originally from?

7
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,100
Tuulkessaami born-allruunga.
I was born in Tuluksak.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Ii-i.
I see.

9
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:49,175
Tua-ll’ imkut-qaa ak’allaat yuut angullrunritaten qasgini uitalallret?
So, were you born in time to see the people of old who lived in community houses?

10
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,500
Anguyaaqekenka-w’ tua-i tau͡gaam anguvlagluki.
I was born in time to see them but just barely.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,450
Ii-i.
I see.

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,360
Anguqamcagluki.
I just barely born in time.

13
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:04,875
Anguyaaqekenka piciryaraat.
I was born in time to see their practices.

14
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:16,000
Yuut-llu qantarluteng allakarmeng muraggaarnek waten nayuumalrianek.
And people had their own separate bowls made of hollowed out wood like this.

15
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,890
Tua-i tamamta wangkuta qantarluta.
We all had our own separate bowls.

16
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:33,235
Umyuarteq’lartua kinguani, "Nallunge’rmeng yungcaristeńek makut piyuitellrullinilriit."
I would think afterwards, "Even though they didn’t know about doctors, they didn’t share bowls."

17
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:41,265
Nalamallma, nalarrlullma-w’ man’a alungutma nalamalria man’a iqsulirneq.
After my stroke, the left side of my tongue is paralyzed.

18
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:44,155
Ii-i. Canrituq. Taringnarquten.
I see. It’s okay. I can understand you.

19
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:47,395
Pillilrianga-w’. Taringnaqciqlilrianga.
Probably. I may be understandable.

20
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:49,695
Ii-i, assirtuq. Assirtuq.
Yes, it’s good. It’s good.

21
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:57,855
Tua-ll’ makut yuut ilait qanruyutek’lallrit
So, some of the traditional wisdom our people had

22
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:09,410
Maa-i-rpak makunun ayagyuanun ikayuutngunayukluki niiculartukut.
Now, we want to hear about them in case they help these young people.

23
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,020
Piciatun-qaa qanruyuterrarmek qanqeryuumiituten?
Would you like to say any piece of traditional wisdom?

24
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:27,590
Qanqackaryulrianga tau͡gaam wii murilkenrilngataullruunga ayagyuallemni.
I would like to say something, but I wasn’t observant when I was young.

25
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:40,025
Tua-i tupatallruunga tupaglua tua-i qanerturalriamun tua-i pek’artevkenii uitaurlua niicugniuralallruama.
I would wake up to someone speaking because I would not move but stay still and listen.

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,860
Niicugniuralallruaqa qanertura’arqan.
I would listen to them as they were speaking.

27
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:50,975
Makunek piciatun canek:
These various things:

28
00:02:51,005 --> 00:03:03,355
Teglegyaramek, cali-llu qanrucunaunani arnaq, cali arnaq allakarmi angutetun ayuqenrilami
Stealing, and a woman who does not listen to teaching, also because women were separate, different from the men

29
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:12,285
Arnaq tau͡gaam elliin tua-i pilallermitun pitulliniuq.
A woman instead does what she traditionally does.

30
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:32,136
Tua-ll’ waten pitullruakut: "Waniwa-gguq qanruyutmek niiquralaryaaqukut unuaquaqan kesianek atakuaqan-llu atakumi."
And they would say this to us: "We always hear about traditional wisdome every day, and during the evening."

31
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:40,272
Qanrutaqluta tua-i ayuqucirtuutnek qanrulluta.
They would also tell us about instructions on how to be.

32
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:52,319
Maa-i-urluq makut kinguqliit qanrutestaitelalliameng-wa aanameggnek
Because these poor descendats of ours probably are not taught by their mothers

33
00:03:54,404 --> 00:04:00,792
Tua-i atuqiit man’a, irniyaraq-ll’ aturaqluku.
They do unacceptable things, and they also have children out of wedlock.

34
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:06,672
Wiinga-ll’ tutgaraagka malruk irniarlutek atailnguuk.
And two of my grandchildren have illegitimate children.

35
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:18,153
Umyuarteq’lartua wiinga-wa alungutka neggluku qanrucuilamki
I think that it’s because I hold down my tongue and do not speak to them

36
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:27,306
Qitevleqsugcuata-wa wangkucicetun qanerturpek’nateng.
Because they speak English, not Yup’ik like us.

37
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:40,674
Tua-i qanruyun arnaq, arnani-ll’ wangkuta waten piaqluta:
The wisdom surrounding women, they would also tell us women this:

38
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:52,093
"Atam usuurluuq, waten ayuqellriaten. Tan’gaurlurmek-llu tangerquvet iqregken-llu taglutek."
"Look, dear one, you’ve grown this much. When you see a boy, your lips rise."

39
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:58,056
Quuyupitaraulluku-gguq tan’gaurluq.
They said that she would give the boy a big smile.

40
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:10,058
Tua-i wii alik’lallruaqa. Imumek pilartut waten pairtellriani: "Tamana atam quuyurniyuituq."
I would fear that. They would do this when they passed each other: "That one doesn’t smile."

41
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:18,913
Pilallruatnga waten alingnaqliniami man’a.
They would say this to me because it was scary.

42
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,837
Qanruyutet amlleqapiaryaaqut.
There is actually a multitude of traditional wisdom.

43
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:35,245
Wangkuta tau͡gaam nalluyagulluki tuatiilamteki anerqeksaitaput makunun ayagyuanun, ukverngaicukluki-llu.
But because we’ve forgotten them doing that, we don’t bring them up with these young people, also thinking they won’t believe them.

44
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:49,412
Waten makunek elitnaurluteng Kass’atun Yugtun cali qanruyutiit ukvekenritnayukluku wii maa-i umyuaqelalqa.
Since they are educated in English, we don’t think they will believe the traditional Yup’ik wisdom that I remember.

45
00:05:55,888 --> 00:06:05,377
Ellaitnun tua-i, aren tua-i irniaqata kiaruciitnarqeqapiaralliniuq
To them, my goodness, it’s embarrassing when they have children out of wedlock

46
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,590
Camek kegginirluta pillerkarput.
What kind of face we should put on.

47
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:27,177
Makut-llu tan’gaurluut pairtaqamteki tungiinek anuqli’rqan umyuarteqaqluta waten:
And when we’re going to pass these boys and the wind is blowing from their side, we would think this:

48
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:32,057
"Naw’un-kiq wii kiturniarcia ukna?"
"I which way I should pass him?"

49
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:46,954
Tua-i uq’lirnerakun kitula’rqa qanruyuteka-w’ tua-i taman’ umyuaqluku, qanruyutelqa.
I would pass him on the downwind side, remembering the traditional wisdom passed down to me.

50
00:06:48,149 --> 00:07:00,229
Ca tua-i tamalkuan qanruyutekaat teglegyaraq-llu, yuum-llu nalluani camek pianek tegulluta nerrlerkarput.
They had traditional wisdom for everything including stealing, and taking something from another person and eating it.

51
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,724
Tua-i-gguq teglegluta.
That said that we were stealing.

52
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:08,294
Alingnaqluni.
It is dangerous.

53
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:21,360
Qaillun tuani tua-i-wa niiteqerli.
May he hear of it somehow.

54
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:33,345
Makut maa-i ayagyuat ilait tan’gaurluyagaat-llu makut aanait imumek mer’aluteng pilriit qaill’ elli’irtelartut.
Some of the young people here and the boys who drink become different.

55
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,780
Teglegyugluteng.
They tend to steal.

56
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:43,925
Tuaten tua-i tamana ciunguluku qanrut’lalliniitkut wangkuta.
That is the first reason that they tell us.

57
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:58,960
Qanrut’laryaaqelliniitkut tau͡gaam wangkuta tayim’ nalluyagutaqluku eneqeraqluku.
They would tell us, but we would forget it then remember it.

58
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,180
Umyuamteńun tut’aqluni.
It would come up in our minds.

59
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,340
Tua-i-w’ nangllill’ qaa?
That’s all, right?

60
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:11,345
Ii-i.
Yes.

61
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:23,250
Man’a-qaa Yugcetun qalarcaraput, waten tua-i qalartellriakuk waniwa Yugcetun
Is our Yup’ik language, the way we are speaking in Yup’ik now

62
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:29,785
Man’a-qaa mat’um nalliini cagmarnarqenrituq, ciin-llu?
Should we not lose it today, and why?

63
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:42,475
Naamell’. Ellaita-wa tang imutun ilait-llu niipaalugnganateng irr’ituut.
I don’t know. Some of them are also amazed as if hearing it for the first time.

64
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,185
Tua-i tangvagluta.
They watch us.

65
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,910
Tuaten piluta assikellruitkut tamakut qanrucilriit.
The instructors would like it when we did that.

66
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:01,350
Qanra-ll’ uluqsaunaku tangvagluku. Kiavet-gguq ircaqumteńun [ngelgar]tengnaqluku.
And watch him without looking away from his mouth. They said to try to [set it] into our hearts.

67
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:12,210
Aren, maa-i wiinga’urluq cakegtaunrilama, makut-ll’ irnianka qanrucunailnguut.
Oh pity me, I am not a good person, and my children do not listen to instruction.

68
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:19,585
Arenqiatuq qanelput ellmikuunganani man’a inerquun.
It’s unfortunate that the admonishments we speak of seem to be for naught.

69
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:28,490
Inerquuteklerput wangkuta alikellerput ellmikuunganani ellaitni.
The admonishments that we feared seem to be of no importance to them.

70
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:37,575
Man’a tau͡gaam tua-i qanruyutiitni
But this, among the traditional wisdom passed down to them

71
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,140
Qanruyutmek avalingqerquni ciumuruskuniu atawaugarkauguq.
If one keeps the traditional wisdom with him and goes forth with it, he will do well.

72
00:09:49,425 --> 00:10:01,975
Tua-i wiinga’urluq wani elluarrlua-ll’ qallacetenritaanga mat’um, mat’um-w’ ingluma nalarrlulriim tapeqnganga.
Because I have a paralyzed side of my tongue, it keeps me from speaking well.

73
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:08,035
Waten iliini tapqevsiarngat’laraa, tau͡gaam taringnarqua.
It seems to affect me more like this, but I am understandable.

74
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:16,574
Tua-ll’ ak’a tamaani agayuviit maavet tekiteqarraallratni
Then back when the churches first came here

75
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:23,970
Yuut-llu niitengllermegteggu man’a Qaneryaraq agayuvigtaq
And when people started hearing about the church’s Bible

76
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:34,357
Maaten niitaat allaussiyaagpek’nani Yuut qanruyutellricetun. (Ii-i.)
They heard it and found that it was not too different from Yup’ik wisdom. (Yes.)

77
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,123
Tamana-qaa piciuguq?
Is that true?

78
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:43,721
Piciuguq. Piciuyaaquq tau͡gaam wangkuta arenqiatuq atunrilamteńi
It’s true. It is true, but it’s unfortunate that we do not adhere to them

79
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:52,284
Atunrilamteńi, makunek-ll’ irniamteńek piluta pilaamta.
Because we don’t adhere to them, and we do not teach them to our children.

80
00:10:54,338 --> 00:11:01,710
Ilait tua-i... quyalartua. Ing’umek quyalartua Lagilegmek.
Some of them... I am grateful. I am grateful for Lagilek over there.

81
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:09,091
Carrie-mek-wa.
For Carrie.

82
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:17,125
Qanruyutni ak’a uum aturciqaa.
She would adhere to the traditional wisdom passed down to her long ago.

83
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:24,050
Umyuarteqaqlua, "Nauwa-m’ murilkeksailngat’lartuq qalarutellriani."
I would think, "Wasn’t she inattentive when being taught?"

84
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:31,906
Tua-i ilii qemagcituami ircaquminun.
It’s because some people keep them in their hearts.

85
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:40,852
Ilumun piciuluni qanrut’lalliniitkut.
They would tell us that it is true.

86
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,428
Mat’um-qaa nalliini nukalpiat enurnariut?
Are there few great hunters these days?

87
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:56,859
Arenqiatuq nukalpiaruciitut makut.
It’s unfortunate that these people don’t know anything about being great hunters.

88
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:04,847
Imkut kitutulriit-llu paircamceteng-llu kan’a-ll’ tangerrluku ayagluteng kiturluta.
And when we’re going to encounter those who pass by, they would look down and pass by us.

89
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:21,766
Maa-i imum au͡g’um qanellma ilakaa man’a, ilakellinia.
This is part of what I just said.

90
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:36,081
Yuut-qaa nutem ak’a tamaakenirnek ilaliuqtallruut?
Did people have ancient social interactions since ancient times?

91
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:47,956
Ilaliuqtarngatellruut imkut. Allaneq-llu tekican tua-i kelegtuurluku maani Kuigglugmun elliumarilua.
They seemed to have social interactions. And when a guest came, they would always invite him to eat when I had moved here to Kwethluk.

92
00:12:48,578 --> 00:13:02,328
Imna alqairutka Qaltayak unguvallermini pilallra maa-i umyuaqaqa.
I remember what my late older sister Qaltayak used to do

93
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:21,954
Qanrut’lallrullikait-llu-wa allanret nunanun ayalriani caperrnarqelartuq yugnek nallulrianek.
They would probably also talk about how hard it is for guests to go to villages where they don’t know anyone.

94
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:29,632
Qanruyutek’lallrullikiit-wa ilaliulaasqelluki allanret.
They would also probably tell them to be sociable with guests.

95
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,888
Tuaten tua-i qanrut’lallruitkut.
That’s what they would tell us.

96
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:40,232
Ilaliuqetailngut-gguq tungelqurrituq. Camek ilaituq.
They say that an unsociable person has no close friends. He has no relatives.

97
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:56,532
Tau͡gken tua-i waten qanmikun wall’ inerquqerluku-ll’ taurrarmek piqallrulria tua-i ung’aqerrnganani ilii pilartuq, ungavik’ngarrluni.
However, a person who is spoken to or given a small admonishment seems to respond affectionately, as if he were treated with affection.

98
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:08,087
Agurraq-ll’ amllertuq inerquukar.
Even a little admonishment such as "Don’t do that" is enough.

99
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:21,221
Elpeni-qaa makut erenret nalliitni makut ayagyuat akusrarnerurtut?
To you, have the young people these days become mischievous?

100
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:26,988
Tuar tang umyugairutellriit maa-i.
It seems they now lack common sense.

101
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:33,176
Camek tau͡gaam ellaita anglanillerkameggnek umyuangqerrnganateng.
They only seem to think about what kind of fun they can have.

102
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:39,321
Imkut nauw’ qigcigtallrulriit yugnun.
In contrast, they would be respectful to people before.

103
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:46,254
Tua-i camek ikamrarluni-llu piami camek nalkucami ek’arrluku.
When a person was traveling with a sled and found something, he would put it in.

104
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:54,043
Tua-i tekicami nerurarraarluni taqngami imna teguluku anluni tayima.
When he returned and was finished eating, he would take that thing and go out.

105
00:14:54,354 --> 00:15:01,843
Cunaw’ yugnun nasvagturalallinikii teglegpek’naku.
It turned out that he would show it to people without stealing it.

106
00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:09,432
Tua-i pikestengaqan tun’aqluku katagaq.
When he had found the owner, he would give back what was lost.

107
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:16,955
Maa-i kataganek-llu pingqerrniluteng-llu niitnaurtua.
Now, I would hear that people have things that were lost.

108
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:30,587
Qanruyutelput wangkuta umyuamnun ek’artelartuq wiinga. Waten ellilriani arnaurtellriani ca umyuaqnaritulliniuq.
The traditional wisdom passed down to us comes up in my mind. It turns out that we who have become old women like this remember them.

109
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:36,499
Akusrarqurallni imna pelluan.
When one’s mischievous phase has passed.

110
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:50,088
Yugurluut-wa imkut ak’a tamaani yuullret caperrnarqelallrullilriit.
The poor peolpe back then probably lived difficult lives.
