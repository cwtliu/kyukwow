It’s because they’re no different from the church’s wisdom.

93
00:18:54,674 --> 00:19:04,962
Tua-i cakneq kayuqapiggluteng, assiqapiggluteng-llu wangni qaneryaraulliniut au͡gkut Yupiit qaneryarait, alerquutait.
They are very strong and very good traditional wisdom to me, that Yup’ik wisdom and instruction.

94
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:41,524
Qanrutellruaqamki pilaranka, "Kenekngamci ukanirpak wii taangangnaqellrunritua nanikuasqenrilamci."
When I spoke to them, I would tell them, "Since I love you, I have always refrained from drinkins because I don’t want you to feel helpless."

95
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:47,399
Tangerrlaata-llu ilameggnek taangiqellrianek-llu angayuqaalegnek.
It’s also because they see their peers have alcoholic parents.

96
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:55,962
Kusguryugluteng-llu itrutlaata nerucugluki-llu. Mom-ii-gguq daddy-llu taangiquq.
Also, they bring them in in shame wanting to feed them. They say their mom and daddy are drunk.

97
00:19:56,412 --> 00:20:03,349
Tua-i takumcuyullratnek cakneq quyatullruunga cakneq ilumnek.
I would be extremely thankful inside that they were compassionate.

98
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:16,287
Tua-i qanrutlaqenka tamatumek tuaten: "Kenekngamci wii nanikuavkangnaqluci anglicallrunritamci.
I would them about that like that: "Since I love you, I didn’t raise you by making you feel helpeless.

99
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:33,737
"Akinaurlua-llu elpeci kenkepigglua tuaten taangamek tamatumek pisqumanritlemnek umyuaqlua pinritengnaqaqluci pici."
"To pay me back out of great love for me, remember that I do not want you do abuse that alcohol, so keep away from it."

100
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,600
Tua-i taumek tuaten qanrutlaranka.
That’s what I tell them.

101
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,400
Watua maa-i arcaqerluteng caperrnarivsiartut waten:
These days especially, they are getting more difficult like this:

102
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:16,900
Wangkuta Yup’igni, Kass’am-llu piciryaraan akuliigni qukaani tuarpiaq maku’urluut
It truly seems that these poor people are caught in the middle of Yup’ik and Western cultures

103
00:21:17,012 --> 00:21:23,562
Wiinga waniwa tutgara’urluunka ukut tua-i akuliigni tuar uitalriit.
It’s like my grandchildren here are caught between them.

104
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:34,999
Pingraan tau͡gaam tua-i, nani maani-llu qitevterrlainarluteng-llu maa-i tutgara’urluput, wiinga-w’ tutgara’urluunka pingut.
But despite that, in some places here, our grandchildren, at least my grandchildren, are starting to speak only in English.

105
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:43,225
Tua-i puqigtacirramtun nani maani qanrusnguaqangnaqa’artaqluki pilaryaaqanka.
I try to speak to them around here with whatever [English] fluency I have.

106
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:52,487
Tuarpiaq niicugniyuumiilnguut-llu pilkiagaqluteng, qang’a-llu-qaa piciunrilkelkialuki tuaten cali pilkiagaqluteng.
It truly seems that they show that they do not want to listen, or they also indicate that they do not think they are true.

107
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,224
Tau͡gaam tua-i pingraata tuaten pingnaqaqluki pinarqelliniut.
But even though they do that, we must try [to teach] them like that.

108
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:07,712
Cali tuaten arcaqalriamek niicunritniluku tuatequanarqenritliniuq.
Especially also like that, we must not [give up] like that because they don’t want to listen.

109
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:17,324
Niitenrilengraan cam iliini umyuarniurciquq qaruqurteḿinek uumek.
Even if he doesn’t listen, he will someday have regrets about one that encouraged him.

110
00:22:17,374 --> 00:22:22,824
Keneksukluni cam iliini umyuarteqciquq, umyuarteqciqliniuq.
He will someday think that he was shown love.

111
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:36,474
Wiinga tua-i imkut anglillemni kenkenricuklua umyuarteqlallrulrianga tamakut tuaten qanrutestenka.
When I was growing up, I used to think that those who taught me like that were not showing me love.

112
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,075
Cunawa keneklua qanrutlallrullinikiitnga.
It turned out that they spoke to me out of love.

113
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:48,437
Tamana tua-i naspertukluku tua-i maa-i qanrutengnaqu’urlaranka.
With that in consideration, I try to speak to them now.

114
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:22,937
Maa-i mat’um nalliini cali makunek ayagyuamteńek ellmeggnek pilriit amlleriut ayagyuaput makut.
These days, there are also a lot of our young people that take their own lives.

115
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,362
Tua-i ellmeggnek piluteng, anernerteng kep’aqluku ellmeggnek.
They end their own lives.

116
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:34,887
Wall’u callualuteng tuquutaqluteng, ilateng piunriraluki.
Or the fight and kill each other, kill their peers.

117
00:23:35,312 --> 00:23:47,937
Tua-i ilumun ayagyuaq una, ayagyuaqegtaar una ellminek pillra qununarqelaryaaquq cakneq.
Truly, we do not want to lose a young person, a precious young person, who takes his own life.

118
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:54,850
Tua-i tayima makut ayagyuaput, yugni ayuqenritukut.
About our young people, we people are not the same.

119
00:23:54,862 --> 00:24:11,187
Ilaita angayuqrita-llu eq’ukluki wall’u tamana atutussiyaagniluku pivakarqaceteng man’a unguvallerkarteng cup’gut’laraat unguvayuumiirulluteng.
Some people are treated badly by their parents, or when they are constantly told that they are doing something wrong, they lose their will to live, not wanting to live.

120
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:28,362
Tua-i-llu yuk waten tamatumek atutuluni ellmini assiirulluni ellminek, uitacurlallni naspqerturluku tua-i ellminek tayima anerneni kep’laryaaqaa.
And then when a person does that and starts to think of himself as bad, he considers his conflict and takes his own life.

121
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:36,662
Tau͡gaam ellminek kep’ngermiu allamun assilriamun ellangengaituq.
But even if he ends it himself, he will not awake to paradise.

122
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:44,687
Tau͡gaam assiilngurmi ellmi nunakiuraminun ellangeciquq. Pinrilngaunani-llu.
Instead, he will awake in a bad place that he set for himself. And it will definitely happen.

123
00:24:44,849 --> 00:25:01,137
Kitak’ tang wangkuta angayuqrulriani irniaput tua-i pitungraata anagulluki apqiitnek pitukessiyaagpek’naki, pitukluki eq’uyagutevkenaki-llu, tau͡gaam qarutmek.
So, no matter what our children do, let us parents not excessively blame them, as they call it, blame them and start treating them badly, but with encouragement.

124
00:25:01,662 --> 00:25:06,737
Qarutmek tau͡gaam inerquagurangnauput.
Let us only admonish them with encouragement.

125
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:18,687
Arenqiatuq maa-i mat’um nalliini piciryaraqliutaa ayagyuam tamarmi tua-i, ayagyuanrilnge’rmi-llu tua-i atutuluku.
It’s unfortunate these days that every young person has taken upon that way, and even those who are not young do it.

126
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:53,000
Makut-wa tang avatiitni ircenrrarugaat, uurcartangnaurtuq-llu.
You see, there were a lot of legendary little people, and those carrying signaling gaffs would appear.

127
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:57,612
Nunanun-llu waniw’ tekitarkaurrluni uurcaq taun’ tamarluni.
And when that one with the signaling gaff was going to reach the village, he would disappear.

128
00:25:57,787 --> 00:26:06,899
Tamaqertelluku-llu maaken caniatnek, ikamrat makut qavciunguluteng-llu tayim’ ketmurrluteng.
And when he disappeared beside them, there would a certain number of sleds going down to the ocean.

129
00:26:07,675 --> 00:26:16,175
Ketmurqaarluteng yuut taukut nunat ukut up’nerkilriit ciungatni piurluteng tamakut ircenrraat.
After the people from this village who were at spring camp went down to the ocean, those little poeple would be ahead of them.

130
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:19,612
Ciunatni tua-i piurluteng.
They were all ahead of them.

131
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:34,625
Ikamrat makut ketmurqaarluteng kelutmurrnaurtut. Ikamrait-wa kavirpak imaqaarluteng unguvalrianek.
After those sleds went to the ocean, they would go inland. Their sleds were red, filled full with animals.

132
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:46,987
Tua-i-ll’ atakuqerluku tayima tua-i ikamrat imkut maani tua-i ingrik tungiignun tayim’ ayagaqluteng.
And then right when evening set, those sleds here would go toward the two mountains.

133
00:27:12,787 --> 00:27:21,437
Atakuqerluku nutaan uurcartangluni waken nunanek kingunelegmek up’nerkilriani.
Right when evening set, there would be one with a signaling gaff who was from this spring camp settlement.

134
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:30,762
Tua-i-llu qasgitangqellruuq elatemteggun qasgigpagmek, qasgigpaarayagarmek.
And then there was a community house outside of us, a big community house, quite a big community house.

135
00:27:31,537 --> 00:27:41,274
Ap’a’urlurput una Elngum-gguq una atii tailuni qasgim kepneranun pikavet aqumqerluni.
Our grandfather, whom they said was Elnguq’s father, came and sat up there on the community house’s flooded entrance.

136
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:47,074
Un’a uurcaq tagelria ukavet tua-i aturpauqurluku.
He kept singing to that person with the signaling gaff coming inland toward us.

137
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:56,049
Wangkuta-w’ tua-i naseknagni tan’gaurluut-llu unglumakevut ungluluku niicugnikvut.
And we girls and boys listened to him as we held the ones we were hugging.

138
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,099
Aren, kiituani tang yuarutii-llu elitarput.
Oh my, we eventually learned his song.

139
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:08,150
Waten tang atutullrulria tauna uurcaq tangvaurluku:
You see, he would sing like this, watching that person with the signaling gaff:

140
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:20,562
"Uurca-raya-yarra-iya, aa-iya tan’guaravluarrlugaat
"One with signaling gaff raya-yarra-iya, aa-iya the many [?little boys]

141
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:28,299
"Issur-issur-issur-issur, makla-ssiya-yarra-iya
"Spotted seal-spotted seal-spotted seal-spotted seal, bearded seal-ssiya-yarra-iya

142
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:34,087
"Aa-iya, tan’guaravlaarrlugaat."
"Aa-iya, the many [?little boys]."

143
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:39,062
Tua-i elicingqapiggluk’ wangkuta niicugnistaini.
We who listened to him completely learned it.

144
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:56,237
Uurcam-ll’ imum tekicami urenkelluku ciuqerranun nang’arcami negcikcuaraminek, negcikcuarani kapuarrluku wavet elliqerluku qanemciluni.
And when the one with the signaling gaff arrived, when he stood before him with intent, he stuck his gaff here and told a story.

145
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,912
Aqvalgirarkanek, aqvalgirarkat qanrulluki.
He told the ones who would get them that there were things to get.

146
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:14,849
Tua-i aren imkut ircenrraat ciungatni pillret amllertatait ikamrat unuaquaqan ketmurrnaurtut.
Oh my, sleds as many as the little people who had gone ahead of them would go to the ocean every day.

147
00:29:15,112 --> 00:29:21,475
Amllertacirkait cunaw’ tua-i waniw’ ciungatni maniurluki tamakut.
It turned out that they had shown how many would go as they went ahead of them.

148
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,037
Angalkurtellrulrianga qavamkun.
I bested a shaman in my sleep.

149
00:29:50,337 --> 00:29:54,450
Tua-i maaten tang im’ ellangua, qanemcitnaamken.
I came to, let me tell you the story.

150
00:29:54,462 --> 00:30:01,362
Yuilqumi ellangua waten kiirrarma aqumgalrianga nunam qaingani.
I came to in the wilderness, sitting all by myself on the ground.

151
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:09,224
Maaten tang caqalriamek niicama ukatmun takuyartua, amik una.
When I heard something and turned my head this way, I saw a door here.

152
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:18,750
Talliq-wa tang man’ tallirpilirneq nuna man’ tua-i waten agturturluku agiirtellria.
There was a right arm approaching, constantly touching the land here.

153
00:30:19,037 --> 00:30:24,912
Umyuarteqa’artua, "Aling aren, assilriarunripagta tanem man’a."
I thought, "My goodness, this is not something good."

154
00:30:25,812 --> 00:30:35,587
Ayumian tekipailganga yaaqsiggaan piicaglua qavamni camani.
Then, before it reached me since it was a little far, I prayed as I slept down there.

155
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:47,400
Atanermun ikayuusqellua, man’a-llu agiirtelria tekiteqatarteka wiinga ingluliurutkaanek eneqanaitnilua nallunritnilua.
I prayed for the Lord to help me, and that I knew that I had nothing that could oppose this thing that was going to reach me.

156
00:30:47,825 --> 00:30:55,137
Ayuqiikun ingluliurutkaitnilua, piniliisqellua tau͡gaam.
I said that I had not the same power to oppose it, but to give me strength.

157
00:30:55,712 --> 00:31:01,150
Pinimek cikiisqellua mat’um tungiinun.
I asked to be given strength for this.

158
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:35,712
Taqngama uitua waten cetungqallemni irugma akuliigni uluaqa un’ ulurpall’er.
When I was done, I opened my eyes as I was sitting with outstretched legs liek this, and my knife, my huge knife, was between my legs.

159
00:31:36,837 --> 00:31:42,162
Qaill’ taun’ tailarta? Amta-ll’ wii yuilqumllua.
How did that come? Despite my being in the wilderness.

160
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:46,749
Teguqerluku.
I grabbed it.

161
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:52,637
Teguqaamku tangrraqa maa-i tua-i tekiteqatallinikiinga.
When I grabbed it, I saw that it was going to reach me.

162
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:56,887
Atam tua-i caunqegcaqka.
You see, I faced it head on.

163
00:31:57,037 --> 00:32:10,437
Tua-i caungamku maa-i tua-i tekiteqataanga waten wavet ciisqumigglua uluaq waten epuakun tegukeka inglugtun.
When I faced it as it was going to reach me, I knelt here and took the knife on the handle like this as an opponent.

164
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:19,537
Tuani piicaggaarlua uitellruunga ayuqucimtun ayuqevkenii tua-i pinirnganii-llu.
When I opened my eyes after I had prayed, I felt different and seemed strong.

165
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:30,587
Tua-i-llu-wa tua-i maavet unatet elliata waten tallirpilirneret
And then when the right hand came here

166
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:36,562
Wavet uluaq tua-i waten piqerluku ellikeka.
I did this with the knife and put it here.

167
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:45,362
Tua-i ellii-wa tua-i qiaryigtellria. Qelempaglua-ll’ wii qiaryigtellria.
It started crackeling. I shut my eyes tight as it was crackling.

168
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:50,724
Atam qiaryigquraqerluni nunamun kapuartellria.
You see, as it was crackling, it stuck into the ground.

169
00:32:51,337 --> 00:33:00,012
 Call’ im’ qalriuciyaarluni, tuar caviyaaq-llu qalrialria tayima tuar qungagarrluni.
It also cried out, and it seemed that the metal was crying out as it seemed to retreat.

170
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,500
Aren, takuya’rqa talliq im’ tayima.
Oh my, I turned my head and the arm was gone.

171
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:37,312
Waten pilaraitkut: wangkuta-gguq maa-i mat’um nalliini cetuun nuugakun, nuuganek umyuangukut.
They say this to us: these days, we have the breadth of mind as a fingernail.

172
00:33:37,324 --> 00:33:43,262
Umyuarput navkaryukaarluni, iqlutmuqercukaarluta.
Our will of mind is easily destroys, and we easily go the wrong way.

173
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:53,224
Wangkuta ilumun qalarutetullruitkut au͡gkut anguqallemta nekayugnayuksuunata.
Indeed, those we were born in time to see would speak to us without thinking we’d get offended.

174
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:57,737
Nunupiarnganata-llu qalarutetullruluta.
And they would speak to us as if they really were scolding us.

175
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:09,212
Tayima ilavci man’a elitaqaa waten qanelqa: qarulluta taangarturalriarunritlemteńi.
One of you probably recognizes it when I say this: let us encourage each other while we do not consume alcohol.

176
00:34:10,537 --> 00:34:22,950
Peng’gartevkenata qalarutetullruitkut, umyuarput-llu qaillun nekayugnayukluta-llu piyuunata qalrutetullruitkut nunurnganata.
They would speak to us without worrying, and they would speak to us as if scolding us without thinking that we would somehow get offended.

177
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:32,600
Tua-i waten nunupiarnganata qalaruqaarluta, waten kingunertetullruat taq’aqamegtekut:
After they had spoken to us as if they were scolding us, they would say this after when they finished:

178
00:34:32,912 --> 00:34:44,012
"Yuum-gguq tang kenkekni... qalarucuitaa qaillun ayuqengraan canganarqengraan kenkenrilkeńi qalarucuitaa.
"The one whom a person loves... a person does not teach one he does not love no matter what they’re like or if they’re misbehaving.

179
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:52,112
"Yuum-gguq kenkeni qalarutetua waten nunurnganaku, nekayullerkaa-llu umyuaqevkenaku."
"A person teaches one whom he loves as if he is scolding, without thinking he will get offended."

180
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:24,212
Taangaq enurnarluku wiinga ellangellruunga, taangiqellriamek-llu tangeqsaunii.
I grew up when alcohol was scarce, and I didn’t see anyone drunk.

181
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:32,662
Tua-i-llu kinguqvaarni aipangvailegma-llu tangaangellruunga taangiq’lalrianek.
And then later, before I wed, I started seeing people who would get drunk.

182
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:43,049
Tua-i niiqurluku ayagmek picurlautnguluku taangaq man’a ilumun naulluutmi mat’umi tukninrurtuq maa-i.
We’ve heard from the beginning that alcohol brings misfortune, and it is truly more powerful than sickness today.

183
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:45,512
Pininrurtuq taangaq man’a.
This alcohol has become stronger.

184
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:51,262
Cat-llu allat iiinrurrluut cali pininrurrluteng mat’umi naulluutmi.
And other things, medicine abuse is also stonger than sickness.

185
00:35:52,649 --> 00:36:01,837
Maa-i tua-i mat’um nalliini cangerliqvakarluteng maaken ayanrirtut yuut.
Since they are facing very hard times these days, people aren’t leaving here anymore.

Tau͡gaam taangiqluteng, kuingirrlugnek, allanek-llu iinrurrlugnek aturluteng maa-i ayalriit maaken nunamek amlleriut.
Instead, there are now a lot of people leaving here to abuse alcohol, marijuana, and other things like medication.

187
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:19,487
Iliini-llu amllerrluteng quyurmeng ayagaqluteng niitaqluki wangkuta.
And sometimes, we hear that a lot of them gather to travel.

188
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:26,599
Ilumun-lli mat’umi taangami tua-i assinrilnguuyaaqvaa atutustaini.
Oh my, it truly is not a good thing for people who abuse alcohol.

189
00:36:26,724 --> 00:36:31,199
Now, we are discussing alcohol.
Now, we are discussing alcohol.

190
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:34,262
Wiinga nutaan quyurteliyanritua.
This is not the first meeting I’ve attended.

191
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:41,074
Quyurteliyartura’arqama maa-i man’a taangaq callularyaaqerput.
When I attend meetings, we fight against alcohol.

192
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:48,262
Niitellra-llu cali allat wangkuunrilnguut cali callularyaaqaat taangaq man’a.
And from what we hear, other people aside from us also fight against alcohol.

193
00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:51,687
Arenqiatuq assiilnguungami.
It’s distressing because it’s a bad thing.

194
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:58,399
Pegtesciigat’laraa aturyaurtestiin. Tua-i pegtesciiganaku.
One who begins to abuse it cannot give it up. He cannot give it up.

195
00:36:58,462 --> 00:37:04,162
Tau͡gaam tua-i pingnaqellriim tayima pegtarkauyaaqaa.
But one who tries will give it up.

196
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:09,474
Atunritengnaqestiin-llu atunrirarkauyaaqluku.
And one who refrains from abusing it will stop abusing it.

197
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:42,849
Atam wiinga tua-i avani ella iqukluku qantullratni, anguanka au͡gkut ella iqukluku qantulriit
You see, back when they talked about the world ending, I was born in time to see those who talked about the world ending

198
00:37:43,924 --> 00:37:51,999
Tamana-wa tua-i ak’a yaaqvani piitnaq qanrutketullrat, qanrutkelartai angullruanka tua-i.
Way back when they talked about a time of need, I was born in time to see those who talked about it.

199
00:37:52,387 --> 00:38:03,662
Tua-ll’ tang ataucim tang au͡g’um qanellra tua-i tang waniwa umyuaqelgurikeka tang tua-i.
And then, you see, now I always remember what that one person said.

200
00:38:03,674 --> 00:38:12,274
Tua-i-ll’ umyuaqelguriamku ella tang tua-i una aaryaguskeka iqukvanerrlugqurainarnayukluku.
And then as I always remember it now, I am wary of this world, afraid that it will end badly.

201
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:19,850
Kiima-llu pinritliniluku. Tua-i ilaita aaryagutaat una ella.
And it’s apparently not just me. Some are not wary of this world.

202
00:38:21,324 --> 00:38:36,262
Tua-i tamaani atam maaten murilkessagutua angukara’urluut arnassagaat ilait waten ciisqugni ayaperlukek piyuayaurrluteng, ilait tau͡gken piyuananrirluteng.
When I started becoming observant back then, I noticed that some old men and old women would walk by supporting themselves with their knees, yet some could not walk anymore.

203
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:40,612
Arnassagangqetullratni angukara’urlungqerrluteng-llu.
When they had old women and old men [among them].

204
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:47,924
Ilait tegularluki qasgimek anulluki maqilallruut.
Some would take them, bring them out of the community house, and take fire baths.

205
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:52,687
Taqngameng-llu cali itrulluki piyunanrilriit tamakut.
And when they were done, they would bring in those who could not walk anymore.

206
00:38:54,137 --> 00:39:00,887
Tua-ll’ ella iqukluki qanllermeggni waten ilait qanellruut:
Then when they spoke about the world ending, some of them said this:

207
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:12,700
"Tamaa-i-gguq tamakut ak’allaunqurrit tamatum tua-i ellam aciani, tamatum niitetullemta aciani yuullret,"
"The oldest ones who had been alive under the earth, the place we heard about beneath,"

208
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:22,300
Tamakut taukut ak’allaunqurrit qanertut, "Yuk-gguq yuunertuqeryaaqaquq. Tamana-gguq aipiringaitaa."
Those oldest ones said, "A person lives for a long time. He will not do so again."

209
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:25,899
Tua-i cali waten qanertut:
They also said this:

210
00:39:26,012 --> 00:39:34,762
"Atam-gguq tamaani," ella iqukluku qantullratni tamaani ciuqvani,
"Back then, you see," when they spoke about the world ending way back then,

211
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:38,924
"Atam-gguq ilait makut nukalpiat,"
"You see, some of these great hunters,"

212
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:48,474
Waten qasgimi ellangyullerminek-llu qanelria tauna angukara’urluq un’gani caniqami qanelria niilluku
That old man who was just waking in the community house, I heard him toward the door by the wall

213
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:56,562
Ilii-gguq tau͡gaam maktaqellria, "Aa, amci-llu-qaa piyuan tungenqegturanemteńi."
They said that one of them got up, "Ah, it should happen already during our good time."

214
00:39:56,649 --> 00:40:00,749
Cunawa-gguq tamaa-i tamatum pistekameng mallgillrani.
Apparently, it was when the one who would get them was nigh.

215
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:10,187
Yuut-gguq iciw’ ilacingllermeggni-gguq cunawa. Ilaciqanricuitut-gguq yuut.
Apparently, you know, they said that when people hoped for something. They said that people always hope for something.

216
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:19,012
Anucimirqecetaarumallerkameng-wa tua-i tamatum piciqiangaqateng mallgikateng.
They said that they would beg to be liberated when that time was nigh.

217
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:51,924
Tua-ll’ tamaani, tamaa-i tamatum nalliini, wiinga-ll’ tua-i tamakut erenret tanglallruanka.
And back that, at that time, I also used to see those days.

218
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:56,137
Tuar tang uksumi ataucimi pillrulriit.
It seemed they did it in one winter.

219
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:07,499
Ernertangyaurtellruuq, waten erenrillermi kinguani qavaggun ernertangyarani kiatvaarrluku negrem tua-i tungiikun.
The daytime came to be, upriver where the dawn would come, going upriver toward the north.

220
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:10,662
Ernekegtaarnek unuurrluni.
From beautiful days, night would set.

221
00:41:10,712 --> 00:41:18,999
Tua-i qanlartut ilait tamakut angutet erneruaryaurrniluku. Camek iquliqsaunaku.
Some of them men would say that there are not false days. They wouldn’t offer any explanation.

222
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:27,499
Tua-llam cat iliitni akusrarrluta tua-i naanguarluta tua-i tan’geriluni tua-i.
And one day, we were rowdy, playing until it got dark.

223
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:35,387
Enemun tua-i, anglicartekellregma enekenrilkiignun iterlua.
I entered a house that wasn’t the house of those who had raised me.

224
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:40,187
Tua-i-ll’ itqanemkun arnaq au͡gna iterluni kingumkun.
And right when I went in, a woman came in after me.

225
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:46,437
Tua-ll’ itrami kanani aqumvailegmi qanertuq, "Tua-i-am keggna ernertanglliniuq."
Then when she came in, she said before she sat, "There is day out there now."

226
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:54,750
Tua-ll’ tauna tamatum enem yuin angukara’urluat angukara’urluq qanertuq
And then the old man among the people of that house, the old man said

227
00:41:54,874 --> 00:42:04,774
"Ella-gguq una piarkaurtaqami yun’i-gguq nalluyurcivkayuitai. Tau͡gaam-gguq atam elpegcilirraatui."
"When it’s time, nature does not keep its people in ignorance. Instead, you see, it gives them a sign."

228
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:19,325
Atam-gguq tamaa-i elpegcilirai tua-i tamana aturarkani. Ellangcautekani pinariata tua-i elliin yun’i tangerrluki makut nunami yuulriit tangerrluki tua-i pinariata.
He said, you see, that it gives them a sign of what it’s going to do. When it was time to teach them, looking at its people, because it’s time, looking at the people living here on the earth.

229
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:24,924
Atam-gguq tamaa-i nasvagaa ellaitnun tua-i tamaa-i tamaaggun piarkaurrluki.
You see, he said that it is showing them what will happen to them through that.

230
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:39,999
Tua-ll’ qanertuq, "Atam-gguq yuut neryuniuryaaqniartut. Atam-gguq neryuniuryaaqvimeggnek neryuniunrirniartut, neryuniulriartairulluni-llu.
And then he said, "You see, people will wait expectantly. You see, as they are waiting expectantly, they will wait no more, and no one left will be waiting expectantly.

231
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,824
"Atam-llu-gguq ella iqukluku qanelriamek niitnanrirniartut."
"Also, you see, they will no longer hear anyone talking about the world ending."

232
00:42:45,837 --> 00:42:51,375
Tua-i maa-i tamana taum qanellra tua-i nall’aringaarput.
Now, we are in the time that he talked about.

233
00:42:51,499 --> 00:42:58,188
Cali-llu-gguq atam qanikcangqerrnanrirniartuq.
You see, he also said that there would be no snow anymore.

234
00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:02,499
Wagg’uq ata ataucimun ellimangkuniu.
In other words, when [nature] puts it into one place.

235
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:06,377
Tua-i taum qanellra waniwa tua-i umyuaqelguriaqa.
Now, I always remember what he said.

236
00:43:06,388 --> 00:43:09,355
Tua-i ella una aaryagutaqa.
I am not wary of this world

237
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:12,833
Wiinga ellam uum catacia nalluyaaqaqa.
I actually don’t know to how far along this world is.

238
00:43:37,755 --> 00:43:40,288
Cali waten qanellruut.
They also said this.

239
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:45,699
Meluk kiingan tua-i qanrutketullruat.
They only talked about fish roe.

240
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:52,477
Meluk-gguq man’a tua-i allrakurtaaryaaqeciquq nunam iluani.
They said that this fish row will appear every year on earth.

241
00:43:52,488 --> 00:43:54,599
Tua-i-gguq cangaringaituq.
They said it would not change.

242
00:43:54,610 --> 00:44:03,255
Yuum iluanun alingnaringaituq nunam iluani tua-i allrakurtaange’rmi. Tua-i kiingan qanrutketullruat.
They said it would not be dangerous to humans though it comes every year. That’s all they would say about it.

243
00:44:03,533 --> 00:44:08,299
Tua-ll’ mat’um nalliini makut freezer-aat piyaaqut.
And now, there are freezers.

244
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:13,177
Tau͡gaam malruugut makut. Freezer-aaq man’a malruuguq.
But there are two kinds of these. There are two kinds of freezers.

245
00:44:13,288 --> 00:44:21,299
Tau͡gaam una sulunaq umyuarteqaqama cali allrakurtaaryaaqmiciquq elluarrluni taryuumakuni.
But when I think about this salted fish, it will also keep every year if it is salted right.

246
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,577
Allrakut tegulang’e’rmi tua-i cangaringailmiuq tauna.
Though it takes on years, that will not spoil either.

247
00:44:25,811 --> 00:44:30,611
Man’a-ggem tua-i freezer-aaq malruuguq. Catacia nallulartuq.
There are two kinds of freezers. We don’t know how far along they are.

248
00:44:31,055 --> 00:44:40,277
Tua-ll’ cali mat’um nalliini ukut aipaiput tua-i qagruyaaqut watua maa-i ernermi qak’mumi.
And these days, our Caucasian counterparts are [qagret] out there in this day.

249
00:44:40,288 --> 00:44:46,277
Tau͡gaam ayainanermeggni-wa nallunartuq.
But as they go, we do not know what they do.

250
00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:54,588
Umyuarteqaqama atam niicaurtellrianga ak’anek, ak’arrarnek tayim’ ayaglua
When I think about it, you see, I’ve started hearing since quite some time ago

251
00:44:54,633 --> 00:45:06,355
Ak’mum nunam wiinga tangssuilkeḿa yugyalriim nengllilangluni nengelmek nallulriim. Qanikaryaurrluni qanikcarmek nallulriim.
The populous lands out there that I’ve never seen who do not know cold have started getting cold. It’s started getting snowy where they do not know snow.

252
00:45:06,355 --> 00:45:13,966
Tua-i tamakut naucetaat assircanrirai, cali-llu tayima piyagaat.
That is causing harm to plants, and probably to young animals.

253
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:18,333
Tua-i cat cali piyugngalriit assircanrirai.
It is also causing harm to those that were able.

254
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:30,354
Tayima akemkut wiinga tua-i tangssuilkeḿa yui nasperturluteng ellait, naugillertang-wa tua-i nasperturluku.
The people in those lands way over there that I do not see are in heavy consideration, considering how to grow plants.

255
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:41,855
Umyuarteqaqama tamaańnguaqerlua, unguvaseng tunulluku Alaska-m yuinek arcaqakingaitut.
When I imagine being there, they will not turn back from their lives and value Alaska’s people.

256
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:50,554
Cali-am waten qanrutqerciullruunga, mumignganrilngurnek-am qanrutqerciullruunga elisngalriamek:
I was also told this, I was told about this untranslated topic from someone who was knowledgeable:

257
00:45:50,777 --> 00:46:00,677
"Naucetaalget-gguq naucetaamegteggun pimaarkaugut. Neqelget neqmegteggun pimaarkauluteng.
"Those who grow plants must grow plants. Those who food must go with their food."

258
00:46:00,877 --> 00:46:10,455
Tua-ll’ tauna waten cali qanertuq: "Atam-gguq tamana mallguskan, tamana erneruaq naliuciiqiaqan
And then he also said this: "You see, when that time is nigh, when that false day is covered

259
00:46:10,466 --> 00:46:17,855
"Atam-gguq yuut nepengniartut, tua-i ellalkangluteng. Camek atanqaanrirluteng."
"You see, people will start fighting, acting crazy. They will no longer await anything."

260
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:26,689
Tua-i tang maa-i man’a cali waten ayuqellria tua-i maa-i nall’aringaarput qakemkuni ernerni watua maa-i.
You see how it is now, we are in that time during the current days out there.

261
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,399
Ilateng tua-i cakenrirluki.
They do not care about those around them anymore.

262
00:46:58,444 --> 00:47:08,133
Cali mat’um nalliini nallunaipagta. Maurluat una qanqerteńgunripagta.
It is also clear these days. Their grandmother does not teach.

263
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:15,488
Cali-llu wangkurlumta tang apa’urlurluitni maani cailkami qanqerteńguvkenata.
Neither are we pitiful ones, their grandfathers, teachers in random places here.

264
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:23,955
Tuarpiaq tang tua-i makut kingum yui, tuarpiaq tua-i tangvagluki anglanitekellriacetun ayuqluki.
It truly seems that the people of the next generation, it seems like we are just watching them out of fun.

265
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,844
Inqautaunata mat’um nalliini.
We have no sense of discipline these days.

266
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:42,544
Tua-ll’ umyuarteqaqama ella una piciqiaquni waten uksuq man’a aturciqiange’rmiu yun’i qanrusngaitai maa-i watua piqatarniluki.
And when I think about it, when the world is going to change, even if it’s heading to winter, it will not tell its people what it’s going to do.

267
00:47:42,955 --> 00:47:55,288
Cunaw’ tang tamaa-i ava-i ak’a tamalkuita pinrilnguunaki tamaa-i nasvallruamiu qanrulluki yun’i tamaaggun piarkaurrluki.
It turns out, you see, that it would do any of them since it already showed and told its people that it would do that to them.

268
00:47:55,621 --> 00:48:00,321
Tua-ll’ cali waten qanertuq tauna angukara’urluq:
And then, that old man also said this:

269
00:48:00,466 --> 00:48:14,655
"Atam-gguq tamana tamaa-i mallguskan piitnaq waniwa-gguq ukuk ciiq, imarpinraq, atam-gguq kuignun neq’lirtuutengniartuq.
"You see, when that time of starvation is close, these two, shee, Bering cisco, there will be a lot of those fish in the rivers.

270
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:16,877
"Neq’lirtuutengniartuk."
"There will be a lot of those fish."

271
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:25,582
Tua-i-gguq waten yuk nangulluni-w’ tua-i taukuk aipaagnek neqkangqerrluni.
They said that if a person runs out of food, he will have one of those as a food source.

272
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:29,477
Taukuk-gguq aipaagnek nerqaquciqsaaquq.
They said that he would eat one of those.

273
00:48:29,537 --> 00:48:34,247
Ilangcivkenani-gguq atam kemgiutniartuq, kemga iggniartuq.
They said that despite that, he will become skinny, his flesh will deteriorate.

274
00:48:34,257 --> 00:48:39,687
Neqek taukuk elluatuk assilriik, uqulgulutek-llu.
Those two fish are appropriate and good, and they are fatty.

275
00:48:39,997 --> 00:48:45,527
"Tua-i-gguq," qanertuaq tauna, "tua-i-gguq taukuk neqek piitnam tamatum neqek."
"Those," he said, "Those two fish are the fish during famine."

276
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:48,167
Tua-i man’a avaullrunritaqa.
I haven’t forgotten this.

277
00:48:48,382 --> 00:48:53,182
Maa-i-w’ tua-i umyuaqelguriamku tua-i ella una aaryagutaqa.
Since I’ve been remembering it now, I’ve become wary of this world.

278
00:48:53,677 --> 00:49:05,077
Tua-ll’ cali waten qanellruut au͡gkut: "Ukut-gguq waniwa taryaqviinkut, iqalluunkut, qakiiyaankut, taukut-gguq piirtuyuitut."
Then they also said this back then: "These fish, king salmon, chum salmon, silver salmon, those do not [?]."

279
00:49:05,202 --> 00:49:12,002
Taumek-gguq maa-i watuam nalliini kingumta yuinun waten au͡gkut ellaita qanruyutekellruat:
That’s why, they said, the people back then passed on this traditional knowledge to the current people of our next generation:

280
00:49:12,137 --> 00:49:21,047
Taukut tua-i kuimallratni yuk piyugngakan qaategtevkenaku piyugngataciatun tamaaken tegutesqelluku.
While those are swimming, if a person is able, he should not be lazy, but take as much as he can from them.

281
