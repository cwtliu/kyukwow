They wouldn’t refuse them anything, and even if it was their only one, they would have them use it without payment.

Maa-i tang mat’um nalliini ca tamarmi carraquinrayagaq akiyuutngurtellria ikayuutekaq, cikiutekaq.
These days, you see, every little thing needs payment that should be given as assistance, as gifts.

92
00:11:56,719 --> 00:12:00,890
Cali alerquutengqerrluta wangkuta.
We also had traditional instructions.

My mother said this to me:

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:33,720
"Camek qanruskuvgu nanikualria, assilriamek qanruskuvgu ikayurciqan."
"If you say something to someone who feels hopeless, you will help him if you tell him something good."

97
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,802
Tua-llu waten pianga cali:
Then she also said this to me:

00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:51,239
"Qainga allgulria allganlilria mingqestailnguq, natii imna allganruarii-llu nunguareskuvgu tauna ikayurarkaugan."
"The one who has torn clothes with no one to sew them, if you sew the torn parts closed, you will help him."

99
00:12:51,249 --> 00:13:01,691
Tang maa-i ikayutekelput au͡gkunek avani tua-i yuullemteńi wangkuta akimek ikayuutekaunata.
You see, this is how we helped others in our lives back then when we had no money to help others.

100
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:04,753
Ikayuutektullruaput tua-i
That’s how we helped others

101
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:12,498

And because I used to do that, sewed close these [torn clothes].

102
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:18,447
Atam cali elitengqertuq kia imum ayagniquniu man’a.
You see, someone can learn to do it if they start this.

Maani-llu allgulriamek tangerquni, tua-i-ll’ umyuaqerrluku, "Waniwa-tuq una kitugglaku."
Then when they see torn [clothes], they will think, "Let me fix this."

104

Tuaten elitnarquq. Ca tamarmi elitengqertuq.
One learns that way. You can learn anything.

105
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:35,548
Tamana tuaten atullemni elitellruaqa.
When I did that, I learned how to do it.

106
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:42,552
Tua-i Kassaungraata-llu, makuungraata tangrraqamki piyugnaaqnaunka.
Even if they’re Caucasian, no matter who they are, when I see them, I want to [help] them.

107
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:47,295
Nungucugyaaqluku-llu tauna allganeq umyuarteqaqlua
And I think, wanting to sew that tear closed

108
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:51,666
Tua-i-wa ca tamarmi elitengqerrami.
Because you can learn to do anything.

109
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:57,276
Ikayuqengyaraq yuum ikayuutekaa amllertuq.
There are many ways you can help a person.

110
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:19,566
Amlleq ikayurtaagutlerkaq neqkatgun ava-i tua-i ilii taringekvut
We understood a lot about a part of helping each other through food

111
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:27,018
Avani ikayurtaagutetullruamta wangkuta nallemteńi cikirtaagulluta.
Because we would help each other in our time back then, giving to each other.

112
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:37,396
Neqkamek-llu up’nerkami nuqliterpalaameng ilait unangyuilnguut, neqsuyuilnguut, pisciigalnguut
And because people would have great scarcity of food in the winter, those who don’t catch anything, don’t fish, and are unable

113
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:46,332
Tamaaggun tua-i kanautelaamteki maavet neq’ngellerkaanun.
Because through that, we go down to the water until they have food.

114
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:57,975
Tau͡gaam una waniw’ nugtarrvikluku piqataraput atunem ikayurtaagutlerkaq
But now, we’re going to move on to this subject, helping each other

115
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:03,373
Atunem ikayurtaagutlerkaq.
Helping each other.

116
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:11,914
Pillgutekluni camek wangkuta ikayurtaagulluta.
Helping each other in accordance with something.

117
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:16,956
Wall’ nunalegni cat ilaitni atutuarput tamana.
Or in vilalges, we sometimes practice that.

118
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:25,938
Camek ilavut tua-i carpagmek iliini caliangqelartuq
Sometimes, one of our own has a great job to do

119
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:30,073
Wall’u enelingnaqluni-llu
Or trying to build a house

120
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:43,499
Wall’u muragnek tamaani enengqetuameng, tuskanek piyuitellruameng tamatum nalliini, makunek plywood-at-llu cataitellruameng tamatum nalliini.
Or because they had wooden houses, because they didn’t have plywood at that time, and because there was no plywood at that time.

121
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:52,272
Tau͡gaam muragnek enekarrluteng yuut maani Kusquqvagmi pitullruameng
But because people here on the Kuskokwim would gather wood to make houses

122
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,392
Tamakunek atussiyaanringameng
Because people aren’t using those too much anymore

123
00:15:57,403 --> 00:16:12,374
Cali nallmeni atuqaqulang’e’rmegteki mud house-at au͡gkut apqait, tamatum nalliini atutullruamegteki up’nerkillerni-llu, kiillerni, uksuillerni-llu
And though they used what they called mud houses in my time, because they had those at that time in spring camps, fish camps, and winter camps

124
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:15,283
Tua-i tamakut atuumamallrukait.
They used those for a long time.

125
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:25,922
Tau͡gaam nunani waten ukut nunarraat camek caliaqata ikayugncarilartut caperqelaamegteki
But in these villages, when these small vilalges work on things, they ask for help because they find them difficult

126
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:34,131
Muriit-llu makut uqiggetenrilameng, canek-llu cayugcuutnek piitellruamta tamatum nalliini
And because these logs are not light, and we didn’t have machinery to pull them at that time

127
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:39,185
Tau͡gaam tua-i unatetgun tegularluki pitullruameng.
Because they only took [and hauled] things by hand.

128
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:57,200
Cali tua-i qanruyutelaameng elpengevkalaitkut, ilateng elpengevkarluki uumek ikayurnarqellriamek piaqameng.
Also, it’s because they speak to each other to notify those around them when they do something that requires help.

129
00:16:57,835 --> 00:17:05,164
Tua-i-llu nutaan imkut yuut taukuni nunarrarni uitalriit
Then those people who live in that small village

130
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:17,344
Kitakiilaraitkut camek pirpanrilngurmek ikayuutarkaunrilengramta ullautesqelluta.
THey tell us to come even though they’re not working on something great that requires us to help.

131
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:28,590
Tua-i ellait taqneret ellaita calillgutekluteng piaqata camek ellimeraqatkut wangkuta tua-i
When those adults work together on something and they order us to do things

132
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:38,345
Ca im’ pirpanrilnguq aqvaaqluku, calissuun-llu ca-llu imna ellimerutekaqatgu aqvaaqluku tua-i wangkuta.
We get that insignificant thing, and when they order us to get some tool or something, we would get it.

133
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:46,897
Tua-i tallikelriacetun tamakut taqneret makut camek caliaqameng
We’re like the arms of those adults when they work on something

134
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:58,680
Enemek-llu eneliqatarqameng tagutelaamegteki piavet tua-i caliaqvigkaan nuniinun, maaken mermek tagulluku.
Because when they’re going to make houses, they bring those inland to where they’re going to work on it, bringing them inland from the water here.

135
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:03,277
Wall’u cali
Or also

136
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:19,037
Imumi-am nunalget ukut mat’umek-am ikayungcaritullrulriit qasgimek-llu uumek caliqata’arqameng
A long time ago, these villages would ask for help when they were going to work on this community house

137
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:27,305
Qasgim caliaqsaraa angengami, muragpall’e’rnek-llu piyaraullruami canirtarnek.
Because making a community house was a huge job, and it needed huge pieces of wood for the structure.

138
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:34,012
Nunalget kelegluki invite-arluki pitullruit.
They would invite villages, kelegluki.

139
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:43,394
Ellaita ukut yuut yuk’arteng ikgellekluki piaqamegteki nunalget kelelarait invite-arluki nunameggnun
When they thought that they didn’t have enough people, they would invite other villages to their own.

140
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:51,514
Aperluku qasgimek caliqatarniluteng, ikayuusqelluteng.
Saying that they were going to work on a community house, asking for help.

141
00:18:51,976 --> 00:19:01,862
Tua-i-ll’ taukut nunalget invite-allrit nunanek tua-i tekilluteng, tua-i nutaan tua-i tekilluteng taumun kelgumiimeng.
Then that village that was invited arrived, they arrived because they were invited there.

142
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:07,399
Ak’a tua-i muriit tau͡gaam upingaluteng tua-i kanani pikait.
The wood they were going to use was already ready down there.

143
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:19,160
Nutaan tua-i qavcin nunat, malruin-llu kelellrit tua-i calillgutekluteng caliluteng ikayuqluteng.
Then the several villages, even two, that they invited worked together, helping each other.

144
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:26,684
Tauna enerpall’er qasgiq caliaqluku ikayuqluteng.
They worked together on that huge sod house, that community house.

145
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:32,166
Marayamek-llu patulaamegteki tamaani qasgit
And because they would cover those community houses with sod

146
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:47,875
Makunek tua-i canegnek-llu kanevyailkucirraarluki tua-i nutaan maryamek patulaamegteki muriit tamakut canirtaalteng taqumariaqata.
And because they would cover them with sod after they put in grass so it wouldn’t crumble when the wood they put on their sides were finished.

147
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:58,295
Tua-i-am tuaten nutaan tauna caliaqluku taqvianun.
They worked on that like that until it was finished.

148
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:06,095
Tua-i tau͡gaam taqngan nutaan imkut invite-alteng nunanek, ukut nunalget nutaan
But when it was finished, the villages they invited, the gathered villages

149
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:12,334
Maa-i nallemteńi ap’laqput potluck-aarluteng.
They would have what we call today a potluck.

150
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:21,026
Tua-i tamatum nallii nutaan tua-i nerevkarluki kassiyucuarluteng tauna imna taqngan qasgiq.
At that time, they would have a feast, a mini Messenger Feast potluck when that community house was done.

151
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:32,425
Nutaan tua-i yurarluteng tuaten tamatumek tua-i nutaan akililriacetun piluki, angniutekaatnek pivkarluki.
Then they would dance as a form of payment to them, giving them a joyous time.

152
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:42,492
Nerevkarirraarluteng-llu tamana taqngan tuaten nutaan tamatumek nangnirluku nerevkaritmek.
After they had given them a feast, when it was done, they ended it with that feast.

153
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:48,899
Tua-i potluck-aarluteng nutaan angnirluteng tua-i, yurarluteng tuaten.
They had a potluck, enjoyed themselves, and even danced.

154
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:54,333
Tua-i corporation tua-i piluki ikayuulluuteng atunem.
It was like a [community] corporation, helping each other.

155
00:20:54,705 --> 00:21:04,019
Tua-i tuacetun-llu yuum ataucim caliarkaa cali tua-i ikayurtaagulluteng atunem pitullruameng
Because they would help each other like that with one person’s job

Tuaten tauna ca imna piqataqiit yuum ataucim pia tauna ikayurluku.
With what they were going to do like that, they would help that person.

157
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:22,751
Ellimaaluta tuaten wangkuta ikayuulluta tuaten ellaitni nayurluki pisqelluki.
They even told us to helo like that, staying with them [in case they needed anything].

158
00:21:23,104 --> 00:21:33,318
Tua-i cali camek ukut nunat cali-am yuk tauna atauciq pinrilnge’rmegteggu
Also, these villages, even though they weren’t [going to help] that one person

159

When they bring up something that needs help when this village wants to do something

160

Qanlartut imumi kanani nunani, nunat-ll’ amllenrilameng
They would say in the vilage down there, also because there weren’t a lot of villages

161
00:21:57,806 --> 00:22:04,735
Ukut Moravian mission-aat ayagniqarraalrata kinguani
After the Moravian mission first started
