is traditional wisdom about walking staffs.

Everyone needs this [naturally] grown tool.

They’re good. They’re talking about good things.

Concerning us [our organization], that’s not what we are.

Before they told us anything, we wouldn’t know anything.

Despite that, I also hear about them through CB radios

But before I hear about it from these two, I leave that alone.

Imutun tua-i kevgarraulriatun ayuqlua ukugnun.
I am like a helper for them_2.

But [s]he didn’t do that all winter.

33
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,000
Tau͡gaam wangkutni calinruluni calillruuq murilkurallemni.
But in my observation, [s]he worked harder than we did.

They used to bring Arthur’s child out of the water who had fallen in.

46
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,000
Tau͡gaam ataam kit’aqluni nugesciiganani.
But he would sink again, unable to come out of the water.

Ilavkungqerkunek teguyugngaqapiaryaaqelliniluku

They would have been able to take him had they had some rope
from what the ones2 who told me the story said.

We young people who have grandfathers,
our grandfather’s traditional wisdom.

Also, if we come to the outskirts of a village in the fall, he would say to me:

52
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,000
Nunat-gguq elatiitnun elliquma qertulriamek tangerquma
If I come to the outskirts of a village and see an elevated place

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Ullagluku qainganun mayurlua avateka kiareskilaku
I should go to it, climb, and look around me

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,500
Nunat avatiit kiareskilaku nallunairturluki ukut nunat.
I should look around the village to notify them [of my presence].

I should thoroughly observe this elevated area,
and these [other] elevated areas, and the lakes around them.

They said that they will save me
if the weather turns bad and I do not forget them.

Tau͡gaam tua-i wiinga atuqsaitellruanka tamakut.
But I’ve never done that.

58
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Nalluyaguqurluki-w’ tua-i pilallruamki imumi.
It’s because I forgot them back then.

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Iliini tau͡gaam tua-i nallunritaqluki.
Sometimes, though, I knew them.

60
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,500
Tuamtellu pinauraanga:
And then [s]he would say to me:

61
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,000
Cacetulria-gguq arenqiallugtellerkaminun tau͡gaam tekitaatuuq
A self-confident person only comes upon misfortune

62

Someone they call cacetulria.

63
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:43,000
Tau͡gken-gguq imna caceskilnguq tua-i arenqiallugpakayuunani.
However, [s]he said that someone who isn’t self-confident
does not come upon too much misfortune.

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Ilumun tua-i tamana wiinga atullruaqa.
Indeed, I have experienced that.

65
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Alingtaama tua-i waniw’ arenqiallugpailegma waten ellirtua.
Because I’m scared by nature, I’ve become this old
before coming upon any misfortune.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Ataucirquqapiarmek tau͡gaam waten uksumi mat’um maa-i nalliini
Only a single time in the winter around this time

When Alba downriver and I went returned together after coming here

[S]he wanted me to camp close to Kwigillingok downriver.

I told him that I would go down, that the village was close.

70
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,000

Because I became confused just as we reached the village

71
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,000
Au͡gna-llu malika arulairlunuk piaqa,
My companion and I stopped and I said to him,

72
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
“Ayagiinarpek’nanuk arulairnaurtukuk”
“We should stop without continuing further”

73
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
Pircian-llu-w’ qakemna ella.
Because there was a blizzard blowing outside.

74
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,000
Cunaw’ wavet nunat keluaraatnun arulallinilriakuk.
Apparently, we had stopped right inland from the village.

75

In the morning, I looked out when it was getting bright

I can’t add a lot to them.

I’m also thankful because I had thought that
I wouldn’t be standing here before youpl.

Except that I’m thankful as he said.

82
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000

I also listen for him to request help.

Ugkut eguaqurluki-w’ tua-i ilapuk.
Encouraging our2 fellows downriver.

I’m thankful that he inspires us to follow.

89
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,000

But when he calls…

Ciuqlikegciukut Fred-amek, uumek-llu cali aip…
Fred is a good leader to us, along with this…

…about mushing dogs.

But these men and the older ones know more than we2 do.

93
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,000
Tau͡gaam wangkuk tua-i pisqumiitkuk
But because they’ve asked us2 to

Tamatumek qimugteḿek, qimugciuryaramek
wani watua pisqutacimegcetun qanqatartukuk.
We’re2 going to talk about dogs, dog mushing,
as we2 were asked to do.

95
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,000
Imkut tang wiinga angullrenka yullret qimugteliqullrunritellrulriit.
You see, the people I was born in time to see back then
didn’t have a lot of dogs.

96
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:44,000
Cali-llu tallimanek una tua-i qimugtelilria qimugtengqerrngatetullruuq

Also, it seemed that someone who had a lot of dogs seemed to have five
from what I’ve seen.

97
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Cali-llu qimugtet tamakut yup’igtun aulukluki kenekluki.
They also took care of and loved those dogs like real people.

98
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,000
Ilaita-llu elaturrami petuumalkircuilngatellruluteng-llu.
And some of them didn’t seem to be leashed at all in the porch.

99
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,000
Elaturrami qungelranaurtut ilakuyulluteng.
They would huddle in the porch all together.

100
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Qaillun uirrsuitellruut-llu-qaa tamakut?
Didn’t they ever even fight?

101
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,000
Tuamtellu waten pinarian imkut yullret qanemciaqameng qanernaurtut
And then when it was time like this,
the people back then would tell stories

102
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Ak’a-gguq qimugtengqetullruut kasmurluteng piaqameng
They say that a long time ago, they had dogs that when they pushed sleds

103
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Taqumun wavet petuglukek.
They would leash them2 to the side here.

104
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,500
Ikayuqu’urlukek tua-i tamakut qimugtet atutullruit.
They got help from their dogs as they utilized them.

105
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,500
Ak’a tamaani ciuqvani ikayuqengnaqluki.
Back a long time ago, they tried to have them help.

106
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,000
Cali-llu makut ciulirneput qantullruut waten, qimugciryaurcama-llu:
And our elders would say this, also when I started mushing dogs:

107
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,000
Qimugtem-gguq kiimi aqsaquni qimugteńgutekaa.
Only its stomach makes a dog a mushing dog.

108
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Ilumuuyugnarquq tua-i tauna.
That is probably true.

109
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,500
Qimugtem-gguq kiimi iluni qimugteńgutekaa
Only its stomach makes a dog a mushing dog

110
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,000
Kemengqerrutekngamteggu tamamta.
Because it strengthens the flesh for all of us.

111
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Wangkuta-llu tamana cali nalluvkenaku Yup’igni
We Yupiit also know that

112
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:09,000
Anrutarput imaitaqan angniyuitukut, quuyurnilleq-llu una ikgenani.
When our stomachs are empty, we’re not happy, and smile so little.

113
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Cali-llu makut qimugtet ak’a niitelallrukenka
I also used hear about dogs a long time ago

114
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Ingna-gguq ciulistekegciqapiartuq maligngaluni-llu.
That that one over there has a great leader and is obedient.

115
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:29,000
Tuaten-llu tamakut qimugtet ilait wiinga niitaqamki qanlartut
And when I hear about some dogs like that, they would say

116
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Ciulistii-gguq atam im’um usvitupiartuq.
That that person’s lead dog is very smart.

117
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,500
Cangraan, pircingraan ciunranun tuavet piyullranun tekiutetua.
No matter what, even in a blizzard, it brings its owner where he wants.

118
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,600
Ilumuuguq-qaa tamana?
Is that true?

119
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,000
Ii-i, tua-i taungulliniuq.
Yes, that’s what it is.

120
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,000
Cali-llu wangtun umyuangqerrsukluki qimugtet umyuarteqellruunga.
I also thought that dogs had minds like me.

121
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Wiinga asgurtau͡rluama qimugtem ikayullrani
quyaqapiarallruunga taumek qimugteḿek.
Because I’m doubtful, when the dog helped,
I was very thankful for that dog.

122
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Tangrriu imumirpak ak’ar[pak]…
Look, since a long time ago…

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,500
…tan’gurra’urluulua pissuryarlua ayaglua
yungqellruan tauna pissuryararraq
…as a boy, I traveled to go hunt
because there were people in the hunting ground there

124
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Enenguluni-ll’ kiimi.
And it was the only house.

125
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,000
Tua-i qutegglua ilangqerciqngama alingtaama-llu ayagyaaqua.
I was overconfident because I would have companions when I went
and I was scared by nature.

126
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:28,000
Tekitua maaten taumun enemun waniw’ ciungaramni ayallrullinilriit.
I arrived at the house to find that they had gone just ahead of me.

127
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,000
Imkut nunamiutarnek nerengnaquratullemteńi
Back when we only survived by eating food from the land

Imarmiutarnek-llu pissungnaquratullrulriakut imumi

We would also hunt for minks back then
when the weather outside became like this.

129
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Tua-i uitatkevkenaki.
We weren’t sedentary because of them.

130
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,000
Qavairatekluki-llu tamakut tua-i pitengnaquralallruukut

We also lost sleep to try to catch those in the spring like this.

131
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Tekicama tua-i umyuarteqkilii tuavet,
When I got there, I thought,

132
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,000
“Tua-i cam piyukunia pikilia.”
“Let anything that wants to harm me do it.”

133
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,000
Wangnek qevtua.
I forsook myself.

134
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,000
Tua-i cam piyukunia pikilia.
Let anything that wants to harm me do it.

135
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:08,000
Aren, alingessiyaagpakaama ciulisteka tauna iterrluku ilakluku.
Oh my, because I was so scared, I brought my lead dog inside
to accompany me.

136
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Ilakluku tua-i tamaani tua-i alingyailkutekluku.
It was my companion to keep me from being scared.

137
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,000
Kiingan tua-i cacetuqutekluku.
It was the only thing to boost my morale.

138
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:23,000
Uitainanemni inarrlua aqsiqercama,
qimugteka-w’ kan’a ketemni palungqauralria.
As I was laying down when I was full,
my dog was laying face down down in front of me.

139
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Qaill’ man’a unuk ellirteqerluku
At some point of this night

140
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,900

We used to have oil lamps back then that had wicks

141
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,500
Ilait pingayunek, ilait-llu cetamanek.
Some with three, and some with four.

142
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
Tanqikapiarngatnaurtuq.
It would seem very bright.

143
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Tauna tua-i kenurraq uquq.
That was an oil lamp.

144
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,500
Tanqikapiarngatnaurtuq wangni.
It would seem very bright to me.

145
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
Arenqiatuq-am ircaquqa alingmek imangqertuq.
My goodness, my heart was filled with fear.

146
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,000
Tua-i tauna qimugta tua-i waniw’ tegguteku’urluku qanertua,
With the dog as my source of confidence, I said,

147
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
“Wangkucicetun, wangkutni-ll’ umyuartunruyugnarqut makut qimugtet.”
“Like us, but these dogs are probably smarter than we are.”

148
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Uitainanemni maaten imna qimugteka piaqa
As I was there, I noticed that my dog

149
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,000
Ak’a amiik ugna iriatengllinikii.
Had already started rocking the door back and forth.

150
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,000
Tua-i aren camek pingatqapiggluni.
My goodness, it truly seemed that it was interacting with something.

151
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:15,000
Umyuartequa, “Qayumi tua-i piqataraanga waniw’ tua-i.”
I thought, “As expected, something is going to happen to me now.”

152
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Aren tua-i uitalua.
My goodness, I stayed still.

153
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:25,000
Uitainanemni atam iternerngalngurmun qaterrluni itraaralria.
As I was there, you see, something that look like a white cold draft
was slowly coming inside.

154
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Qaillun-llu pitariqerluni tayim’ amuluni anluni.
And when it had come in a certain distance, it contracted and went out.

155
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,000
Umyuarteqa’artua, “Uumiku pikanirluni piciquq.”
I suddenly thought, “The next time, it’ll go further.”

156
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,000
Qimugteka-ll’ una maani tarrangarrluni.
And my dog started becoming walking about here.

157
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Tua-i nallunaunani wangtun alingluni. Alingluni tua-i.
It was obviously scared like me. It was scared.

158
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,000
Uumikuani piqerlua piunga nutaan arcarikanirluni
The next time, I saw that it was getting worse

159
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,000
Qengarmiaraluni tuaten, qilugyarpiaraqluni.
Even waving its nose, almost barking.

160
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Pinga’arteqerluni atam iterneq man’a itralria.
Eventually, you see, the draft was coming inside.

161
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,000
Ak’akirraq tua qukaqerluku.
It came in quite a bit reaching the middle.

162
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:08,500
Nutaan atam nucuan qimugteka imna tunumnun pamavet tagluni.
When it extracted, my dog dog went up behind me.

163
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:16,000
Pama-i qemirrlumni sugg’eni pulalluku pamavet uitaqertuq.
It put its snout into my spine behind me and stayed.

164
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Tamana iterneq uatmurquraan, tamana tua-i anngan
When that draft went toward the door, when it went out

165
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,000
Qimugtema tang pam’um sugg’erminek cinguuqiliu tunuka.
My dog behind me pushed my back with its snout.

166
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,000
Umyuarteqa’artua, “Uum tang anesqessugnarqekiinga.”
I thought, “This [dog] is probably asking me to go out.”

167
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,000
Aren uitangnaqa’arcaaqellemnek
My goodness, after I had tried to stay

My sleeping mat, and after I put on my parka

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:53,000
Taukuk tua-i inarrvicualler imkarluku nemkarluku,

I rolled up and bound my sleeping mat,
put on my hood, and went out.

Qakug[caq] uavet, una iteryaraq uaqliq lumarrallermek agalriartangqertuq.
[Qakugcaq] toward the door, there was a cloth hanging out by the entrance.

171
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,000
Qakmavet tau͡gken anyaraq amiipiuluni.
The exit going outside, however, was a real door.

172
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,000
Tauna tua-i waniw’ anqataama, nacaqaama
When I was going to go out, when I put on my hood

I blew out those2 lamps2 in a circle.

174
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500

I turned them off.

175
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,900
Aren tua-i amik cuqluku anelrarlua.
My goodness, I estimated [the size of] the door going out.

When I reached that cloth,
I was afraid that I would run into the [qakugcaq].

Aren pivailemku ankilii ellamun.
My goodness, before I did, I went out.

When I went out, this way, and I probably did it the wrong way

179
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,000
Akertem ayagyaraa maliggluku uivesqelarngallruitki.
I think people told them to go around clockwise.

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,000
Kiarteksaunii-ll’ tua-i, kiingan tau͡gaam acika paallallerkaqa tau͡gaam.
And I didn’t look around, only beneath me in case I tripped.

Kassuamku tua-i avateka-ll’ man’a tangeqsaunaku.
When I went around it, I never saw the area around me.

Qimugta tauna tua-i sagtanka pingayurraungata qimugtenka.
I spread out my dogs because I only had three.

When I spread them out, my lead dog came

It put these2 on by itself
without being told to and crouched.

And then after they2 were harnessed, I didn’t look around

I started going like a snowgo because [it was so fast].

My goodness, I was so scared that the [qakugcaq]

I was amazed at my dog.

Ikayuqapiarallrukiinga tuani tua-i.
It was of great help to me then.

Anesqellua tua-i nallunailngurmek cinguurlua.
It pushed me, obviously wanting me to go out.

That its stomach is what makes a dog a mushing dog.

And then when it’s time we utilize them,
teaching them how to be sled dogs.

199
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,500
Kiituan wangkucicetun elitut tua-i.
Eventually, they learn like we do.

This is all I’m going to say.

203
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Akngirqenglliniuq wall’u tuqucilliniuq.
It apparently hurt or killed someone.

Avani tan’gaurlullraullemni tamakunek niiteksaitellruyaaqua.
Back when I was a boy, I never heard about those.

205
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Tau͡gaam maa-i tamana maa-i niitelangarput.
But we have started hearing about that now.

Cali-llu pavani im’ ellangartelallruama Akulmi
And because I have my earliest memories inland in the Akula region

207
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,000
Cali makut qimugtet piciatun ayagayuitellruut.
These dogs didn’t wander anywhere either.

208
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,000
Pikestaita petuumatullruit.
Their owners kept them leashed.

209
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:26,500
Cali-llu qanruquratuluta ullagavkenaki qimugtet pilaasqevkenaki
kegciqniluta.
Also, they always told us not to go near dogs
because they will bite us.

210

Tamana tamaa-i cali wangkuta apa’urluurtellriani
We who have become grandfathers

Makut qimugtet ayuqenritliniut.
These dogs are apparently all different.

213

Tamana tamaa-i cali umyuaqnaqluni,
We must also remember that,

Cali-llu elicungcautekluku pinaqluku makunun tutgaramteńun.
And we must teach it to our grandchildren here.

Tutgarama kankut qimulleraanka paqtailarait
My grandchildren go to see my dogs down there

217
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,500
Tau͡gaam inerqualaranka pivallagavkenaki.
But I admonish them against treating them excessively.

218
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,000
Cali-llu qaillukuarpek’naki pilaasqelluki.
I also tell them not to bother them.

219
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,500
Wii murilkelaranka makut waten qanruyutengqerrata:
I watch over them because they have this traditional wisdom:

220
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,000
Una-gguq qimugta piyuilngalnge’rmi ilani piaqata
Even when this dog doesn’t seem like the type, when the others do

221
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,000
Ilani ilagarluki tuaten yuliutuuq.
It attacks people along with the others.

222
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,000
Tamana tamaa-i amllermek ilasciigataqa.
I cannot add a lot to that.

Wani break-arciquci.
Youpl will take a break now.
