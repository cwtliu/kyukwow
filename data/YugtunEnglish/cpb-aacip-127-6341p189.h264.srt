00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
...ayagalallrat
...in their travels

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,790
Kit’ellrianek niiqurangukut maa-i.
We always hear about people drowning now.

3
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:12,972
Cam, qaillun taukuk wani qalarutekniagken.
Please talk about what and how.

4
00:00:14,257 --> 00:00:24,047
(Yaa.) Ayuqeltassiigullukek (Ii-i.) cukanrarluni cukaunani kit’ellrak, kit’elallrak naliak amllenrua ciin-llu?
(Okay.) Compare (Yes.) drowning when going fast and going slow, which one has more drownings and why?

5
00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:31,607
Kitak’ tamana wani qanrutkeqerru.
Please speak about that.

6
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:46,657
Tamaa-i, tamaa-i tamatum nalliini ayagassuutengqertut qayanek.
Back at that time, they had kayaks for traveling.

7
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:59,922
Tua-llu anuqengararutaqateng qaspengqerrluteng-llu imkunek maklaaret qiluitnek.
Then when the wind suddenly picked up on them, they had thin pullovers made of bearded seal intestines.

8
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:05,252
Irnerrlugnek qaspernek all’uki pitulinek.
Seal gut pullovers that they put on.

9
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:11,802
Tamakunek qayam una painga, iciw’ uivenqellriit?
With those, the rim of the kayak here, you know how they’re round?

10
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:14,837
Qayanek-qaa tanglallruuten? (Yaa.)
Would you see kayaks? (Yes.)

11
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:17,052
Iciw’ uivenqellriit?
You know how they’re round?

12
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:22,472
Kinguqaminek qumigluku qayam painga.
[S]he would put the hem around the rim of the kayak.

13
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:32,977
Tua-i-llu nutaan pelacinaunrilngurmek tapengyaarmek pinevkarluku piliameggnek nemerluku. Tua-i-gguq ket’garluku.
Then finally, bind it, not with twine, but with binding material that they made by cutting sealskin in a spiral. They call that ket’garluku.

14
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:41,002
Tua-i qairem waten pilangraani iterciiganani qayaan iluanun.
Though a wave does this to him, it can’t go inside his kayak.

15
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:45,747
Tuaten pitulliniit, pitullruut.
They used to do that.

16
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:51,742
Qayaan iluanun iterciiganani meq qumikngani.
Water can’t go inside his kayak because it’s under his hem.

17
00:01:52,227 --> 00:02:01,277
Tua-ll’ makut wani angyat kill’uteng-llu piksaitelaryaaqut.
Then these boats, they’ve don’t really sink.

18
00:02:01,357 --> 00:02:12,972
Tau͡gaam mat’um, mat’um aturyulallrata atungnaq’lallrata picurlagavkalarai.
But this thing they tend to abuse, try to abuse, leads them to misfortune.

19
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:19,162
Picurlagatek’larai taangamek aterpagcimalria.
What’s called alcohol leads them to misfortune.

20
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:24,322
Tamakutaitellrani picurlalriartaitellruuq.
When there was none of that, there were no accidents.

21
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:32,207
Picurlalriamek niicuitellruukut kiagmi kit’ellriamek.
We didn’t hear of anyone in an accident, drowning, in the summer.

22
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:43,977
Maa-i mat’um, mat’um tua-i atuusqumanricaaqaat nunat tamarmeng yuita ayagyuat.
Now, people in every village don’t want the youth to abuse it.

23
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:47,957
Ayagyuanrilnge’rmeng-llu pilalriit.
They do it even if they’re not young.

24
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:54,117
Kanevtellriatun waten, kanevtellriatun ayuqluku.
Dying in great numbers like this, like they’re being scattered.

25
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:59,762
Tua-i tuaten wii ayuqekutela’arqa, kanevtellriatun.
That’s how I compare it, like being scattered.

26
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:09,917
Iciw’ kanevciaqamta tua-i kanvelalria. Imna-ll’ taryirissuutmek pilallerput kanvaqluni.
You know when we scatter things, they scatter. And what we call a salt shaker scatters [salt].

27
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:23,727
Tuarpiaq umyuartequra’rqama tuaten tua-i kanvutekluku man’a aturyulallrat.
It truly seems, when I ponder upon it, that what they tend to abuse makes them die in great numbers like that.

28
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,560
Tamakut camek nallullruut tamatutaitellrani.
They didn’t know of any [accidents] when there was none of that [alcohol].

29
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,450
Tamakutaitellrani picurlagayuunateng.
When there was none of that, they wouldn’t get into many accidents.

30
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:45,460
Tuaten tua-i. Angenricaaqut-ll’ au͡gkut ayagassuutek’lallriit. Qayat kiingita ayagassuutait.
Like that. Their means of travel back then also weren’t big. Kayaks were their only means of travel.

31
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:57,750
Man’a kitak’ cali waten maa-i niiqurangelriakut qanruyutet niitnaunrirniluki.
So now, we also hear now that we don’t hear traditional wisdom anymore.

32
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:04,700
Elpeni cali murilkellerpeni ciin qanruyutet qanruteknanrirpakartatki?
In your observation, why don’t they talk about traditional wisdom anymore?

33
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:17,350
Tua-i, tua-i au͡gkut, au͡gkut ciuqlimta, ciuqliput nang’ngata.
It’s because our elders are all gone.

34
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:31,040
Qanruyutet tamakunek ciuqlimteńek qanrutkestairucata. Qanrutkestairutut.
It’s because there’s none of our elders to speak of that traditional wisdom. There’s no one to talk about them anymore.

35
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:38,880
Ilaita-llu nallunrit’laryaaqellikait tayima.
And some probably know them.

36
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:46,130
Qanruyun ak’allaq niitelaryaaqellikii.
[Some] probably hear about the old traditional wisdom.

37
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,900
Tamaa-i qanrutkurtairucami.
It’s because there’s no one to speak about them anymore.

38
00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:06,870
Atam tamakut tamaa-i angullrenka qalaruyutseng cimiqetaarpek’naku.
You see, the people I was born in time to see wouldn’t change what they were instructed.

39
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,500
Atauciq tua-i atauciuluku qalarutkuratuat.
They’d speak of one thing in one way.

40
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,390
Uum qalartaqami qanrutkaqluku.
When one instructed, [s]he’d speak of it.

41
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:23,350
Akaurpailgan allam uum qanraqami qanrutkaqluku.
Before long, when another instructed, [s]he’d speak of it.

42
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:33,590
Tamaa-i tamakunek tegganrurtellrianek qalarutkestairucameng
Because there are none of those who’ve become elders to talk about them anymore

43
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:45,000
Qanruyun man’a qanrutkuranriraat nang’ngameng tamakut qalarutkestek’lallri.
They don’t talk about this traditional wisdom anymore, because those that talk about them are gone.

44
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,660
Waten, waten cali makut wani ciuliaput waten qanerturalalriit
Also, our elders here say this

45
00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:05,990
Qanerturalalriit-wa tuar, tuar qanruyutet pinrillrat ayagyuanun elliluku qanrucunairutniluta.
They always say, it seems, it seems that they put [the blame] on young people for the disconinuation of traditional wisdom, saying that we don’t heed advice anymore.

46
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,400
Ciin, ciin tamana cali tuaten piularta maa-i?
Why is it like that now?

47
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:20,340
Tua-i maa-i tang atungekvut tua-i tamana imna qanrutkelallrat.
Now, you see, we’ve started experiencing what they’d talk about.

48
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,860
Qanrutkelallrat atungekvut.
We’re starting to experience what they’d talk about.

49
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:33,187
Qanqauteng’e’rmi aturciigaliluku ilii.
Though one is given advice, [s]he cannot follow it.

50
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:39,827
Niicugnirraarluni tua-i-ll’ ayagluni tua-i unilluku.
After listening, then [s]he goes away, leaving [the instructor].

51
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:51,592
Tamaa-i tamana ciuqvaar umyuaqluku ilaita pilallruut.
With that, some would think of the far future.

52
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:54,672
Maa-i tua-i qanrutkelallrat.
This is what they spoke of.

53
00:06:55,067 --> 00:07:01,557
Qanruyun atunrirciqniluku-ll’ wii niigartelallruunga.
I’d also hear that they won’t adhere to traditional wisdom anymore.

54
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:07,907
Qanrutestairuskata qanruyun atunrirciqniluku.
They said that when they have no more instructors, they won’t adhere to traditional wisdom anymore.

55
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:12,007
Avani ciuqvaarni niigartelallruaqa.
I’d hear that a long time ago back then.

56
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:23,142
Maa-i-qaa tamana niitelallren elpeni piciurtenguq qanruyun atunrir[ciqniluku]?
Now, to you, is it true what they said about how they’d stop adhering to traditional wisdom?

57
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:28,122
Ii-i, ii-i, piciurtuq tua-i maa-i.
Yes, yes, it’s come true now.

58
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:42,067
Tang au͡gkut yaaqvaq-llu tekitarkaq nallunrilngurtun pilallrulliniut, nallunrilngurtun.
You see, it was like people back then knew what was a long time to come, like they knew.

59
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:54,812
Camek wani elpet tua-i paiciryullerpenek
Whatever [wisdom] that you want to leave with us

60
00:07:55,302 --> 00:08:04,712
Wangkuta ayagyuani wall’u niicugnilriani camek alerquutmek paicirluta.
Leave us young people, or those listening, with some traditional instruction.

61
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:05,732
Ii-i.
Okay.

62
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:08,057
Camek elpet paiciryarcikut?
What would you leave with us?

63
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:14,952
Paiciutekaqa, paiciuteksugyaaqek’ngaqa waniwa:
I leave behind, this is what I want to leave behind:

64
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:20,172
Kenkulluci, ayagyualriani kenkulluku.
Treat each other with love, young people, treat each other with love.

65
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:25,082
Ilaci cangayugcetaarpek’naki pisqelluci.
I tell you not to affront those around you.

66
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:30,752
Ilakelriatun ayuqulluci elpeceńek.
Treat each other as family.

67
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:39,702
Maa-i tang makut wani iqlutmun ayagarcukaarangelria
Now, you see, these people easily go astray.

68
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:45,822
Qanruyutni, wall’u cangayullni ayagneqluku.
Starting from traditional wisdom, or, being offended.

69
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:53,477
Ayuqlutek, ayuqlutek arnaunge’rmi tuaten ayuqliriuq.
[Man and woman] the same, the same, even a woman has become like that.

70
00:08:53,767 --> 00:09:05,577
Cangayuutni iqlutmun ayagarutekarkauluku. Iqlutmuqrulluku, iqlutmuqrutekluku.
She goes astray because of being offended. She goes astray from that.

71
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:15,987
Tau͡gaam waten, waten atam cangayugcetaarpek’nani ilaci ayagyuallguceci.
But like this, do not affront your fellow young people.

72
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:22,402
Angutngurtengraan wall’ arnaurtengraan ayuqluku piurquvci
If you treat them the same, even if they’ve become a man or woman

73
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:30,032
Imutun tua-i uqisngauralriatun, uqisngauralriatun ayuqniartuci.
So it will be like you’re sheltered, like you’re sheltered.

74
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:38,622
Man’a maa-i umyuaqelarniaran catairut’nge’rma-llu wii.
Remember this even when I’m gone.

75
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:44,247

Okay, thank you. Thank you for speaking with us.
