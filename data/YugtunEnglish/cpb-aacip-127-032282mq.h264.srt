But I thoughtt, "If I were there, if I moved there from here on out, I would be very, very homesick for Alaska here."

58
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:18,521

Up until now, since my children are grown, though they wanted to travel with me, I wouldn’t.

81
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:04,345
Iciw’ umyuarteqlua maani akirrarmek-ll’ qunulua.
You know, I would think of also being reluctant to spend a little money.

Ellaita-llu akiuciryungraatnga akirrait qunukluki.
And though they wanted to give me money, I didn’t want them to spend that little money.

Tua-ll’ waniwa au͡g’um nengauma aanii nangteqngan
Then now, since my son-in-law’s mother is sick

86
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:39,280

And before they asked me, you know, before they asked me if I wanted to, I went with them since I wanted to go myself

89
00:08:53,036 --> 00:09:00,147
Kenekngamku tauna maurluat meet-allruamku ak’a ciungani malrurqugnek.
Because I loved their grandmother since I’d met her twice in the past.

Ellminek tailuni maavet kassuuteqatallragni. Meet-allruaqa tamaani.
She came of her own accord when they were going to get married. I met her then.

Cali aanii tauna wii kenekluku.

I’d tell them to go to her.

99

Nulirqeqatallragni tamaani pisqellrunricaaqaqa cakneq ayaulluku akmavet peggluku nanikuavkarnayukluku.
Back when they were going to get married, I really didn’t want her to in case he might bring her over there, abandon her, and make her feel helpless.

100
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:27,480
Tauna piciunritlinian maa-i cakneq kenekluku.
Since that wasn’t true, I love him a lot now.

Nallunrilamku qaillun irniami keneknarqetacia, tutagara’urlumi-ll’ keneknarqetaciit qaillun nallunrilamku.
Because I know how much one loves their chidlren, and because I know how much one loves their grandchildren.

103
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:58,541
Tua-i wangcetun ayuqsukluku cakneq cingumalallruanka allragnirpak.
Thinking that she was like me, I’d encourage them a lot all last year.

104
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:15,220
Camek tayima qanqeryukuvet. Aptellrunrilkengamnek akmavet ayallerpenek qaneryukuvet wall’ qaneryuumiilkuvet.
You can say something else. You can say something about what I haven’t asked you about your travels out there, or if you don’t want to.

105
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:23,179

Since [s]he didn’t have time, our escort didn’t take us to a lot of things.

00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:11,530
Tamakunek tua-i, arcaqerlua-ll’ tamakunek irr’iyullruunga.
Those, I was especially in awe of those.

113
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:22,831
"Atak’ tamakut ellicartait," umyuarteqlua, "Angli-lli tamakuni ellicartaitni iciw’ they have patience."
"Look, their keepers," I thought, "Wow, their keepers are so, you know, they have patience."

114
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:28,811
Qenqercuunateng kaaka tayima ellicamaita ak’aki.
They don’t get angry, listen, as they pen so many.

115
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:35,025
Tua-i cakneq casqaqaiceteng canaurtut tamakut.
When they were commanded, those [animals] would do things.

116
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:43,104
Nepliisqaqaceteng-ll’ nepliqluteng. Quyurnisqaqaiceteng-ll’ quuyurniaqluteng.
When they were told to make a sound, they made the sound. When they were told to smile, they smiled.

117
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:52,155
Tamakunek cakneq irr’iyullruunga tua-i cakneq. Taukunek angelrianek irr’iyupiarallruunga.
I was very amazed by those. I was amazed by those large [animals].
