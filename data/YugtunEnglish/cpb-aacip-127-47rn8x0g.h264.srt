About Christmas from before, when you first learned about it when you were [?growing], what instructions did they give about generosity?

2
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:20,701
Avani au͡gkut ciuqliput nepaitellruut. Nepaitellruut.
Back then, our ancestors were peaceful. They were peaceful.

3
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:27,902
Tua-i waten ciulirnemeggnek qanrutesterluteng, inerqurterluteng, ayuqucirturterluteng.
They had their elders like this to instruct them, admonish them, and advise them.

00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:36,304
Cali-llu waten tukuullrunritut avani ciuqvani. Canek-llu makunek Kass’artarnek teguqerrartevkenateng.
Also, they weren’t wealthy a long time ago. And these Western things weren’t on hand.

5
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:42,924
Tua-i waten ilateng piilnguut ikayurluki, tua-i alerquutekluku. Tuaten ayuqellruut.
They would help those around them who didn’t have anything, as was traditionally instructed. That’s what they were like.

Cali piilnguut waten tangerrluki piilutaitnek ikayurluki, navrilluki cali piilnguut. Tuaten ayuqellruut yuut au͡gkut angullrenka.
Also, they helped those who didn’t have anything by looking at what they didn’t have, and also lent them things. That’s what the people I was born in time to see were like.

7
00:00:55,347 --> 00:01:03,577
Tua-i-llu man’a waten castailnguq iciw’ tua-i elliraat makut, aipainret pinarquciicetun tua-i ikayurluki.
Then one who didn’t have a provider liket his, you know, these orphans, widows, they helped them with whatever they needed.

Ikayualuki akinaullerkameggnek pivkenateng.

They told them not to do this: "This person may reward me. Let me do this." They said not to do that.

Instead, without thinking of payment like this, help those who are in misfortune around them.

Kevgailnguut kevgarturluki. Tuaten ayuqellruut yuut.
Seeve those who have no helpers. That’s what people were like.

Camek tamana wani kangingqerrniaqluku akilircetaarpek’naki canrituq, kiik’ ikayurluku. Camek kangililallruatgu?
What did they say was the meaning of being okay without payment, but to go ahead and help? What meaning did they prescribe to it?

00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:42,007
Waten kangililallruat: tua-i-gguq tamaa-i tamana kingukegtuq.
They prescribed this meaning to it: that has good aftereffects [later in life].

15
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:52,774

You know, we didn’t hear promises back then. And we didn’t hear threats.

Tuaten ayuqellruut yuut.
That’s what people were like.

So, how old were you, how old were you when you first heard about Christmas? And what did you do [?] Christmas?

18

Alussistuamek tua-i niitelangukut wangkuta. Qaneryaramek tua-i niitelangukut.
We started hearing about Christmas. We started hearing the Bible.

So, when Christmas first start, how did you...

Then they started having Christmas, you know, when they were given a pastor downriver in the old village of Qinarmiut where I grew up.

They’d celebrate Christmas as they do now, celebrating as told in this Bible.

People weren’t like this a long time ago.

And when this Bible appeared, they were absolutely nothing like this.

Also, for those without anything, those who had [something to spare] would give them some little things.

Tua-i-llu yuum ciuniuqsailkuniu cailkamceciiqellinia anirturteksaguteksaunaku.
Then if a person doesn't welcome him, he will leave them on on wayside without having become their savior.

92
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:31,169
Tuaten ayuqelliniuq.
That's what it's like.

93
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:44,217

"There is none among us who lives by themself or dies by themself. But as we live, we live for the Lord."

97
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:15,405
Maa-i ukvelriim qaneryarartaa waten qanerluni: "Atanermun yuugukut. Tuqukumta-llu Atanermun tuquciqukut."
The believers’ creed says this: "We live for the Lord. And when we die, we will die for the Lord."

98
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:27,616
Taumek yuungramta wall’u tuqungramta Atanrem pikaakut. Tua-i ukvelriit tamaa-i qanrutkumallrat piciuluni-llu. Piciugarkauluni.
That’s why whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s. That’s what believers have said, and it’s true. It must be true.

99
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:31,633
Tau͡gken piciunrilnguut aturngaitaat tamana.
However, those who aren’t true won’t experience that.

Instead, [s]he will be in fire.

102
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:57,632
Au͡gna tua-i yugnun erinaka-w’ tua-i saagarrluku cali-ll’ aipaimteńun makunun erinaka [saagarrluku].
I spread my voice about that to the people, and [I spread] my voice to our counterparts here.

103
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:05,550
Aipartek umyuaqelaryaaqaqa uumirpak ak’a una qanrutkeqeryugyaaqluku tau͡gaam takaqlutek nalluyuqlutek.
I’ve been thinking of one of you lately wanting to speak of this, but I was uncomfortable and intimidated by you.

104

Tua-i-ll’ airpartek umyuaqelaryaaqluku mumigteqaasqelluku qanelqa.
Then I thought that one of you would translate what I said.

105
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:16,137
Yuk au͡g’acurlakuni, man’a unguvani pellucurlakuniu
If a person passes away in sin, lives this life unacceptably

106
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:26,793

Instead, [s]he will go into the lake forever, to be in fire forever in the utmost suffering.

00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,079
Man’a unguvavut tua-i arenqiiryarai-llu arenqiirturyarai amllerrsaaqut.
There are many ways to resolve our lives.

108
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:36,841
Tua-i tau͡gaam yugmun waten maantenriqan qama-i niitukut.
But when a person is no longer here, we’ve heard [of one] upriver.

109
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:39,628
Tua-i-llam taumi kep’uq tua-i.
Then at that time, [the life] stops.

110
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:46,014
Iciw’ tua-i arenqiirtuumarmi-w’ tua-i.
You know, with whatever resolution [that life] had.

111
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:48,118

Waten tang umyuaqa ayuqsaaqellria: aiparpetegnun imna-ll’ Aqum’aq-llu qanelqa Kass’atun mumigartesqumayaaqluku.
You see, this is my thought: that either you or Aqum’aq would translate what I said into English.

114
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,889
Tua-i elluarrluteng pillerkaat elpekesqumayaaqluku.
I want them to understand how they could [live] well.

Now, wish us good tidings, tell us of your thoughts, you know, wishing us a Merry Christmas.

Okay, so let me talk about it now if I have some of those people to listen to me.

119

Jesus-aam yuurtellra atam Agayutem... tua-i-q’ waniwa? Waniwa-q’ tua-i?
Jesus’ birth, you see, God... is it going now? Is it going now?

120
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,290
Yaa.
Yes.

121

Atam Agayutem kenkiin nunam yuinek, ellarpiin yuinek kenkitacian angtataitetacianek
You see, God’s love fo the people of the land, how there is nothing greater than his love for the people of the world

122
00:13:57,184 --> 00:14:04,114
Waten ayuqelliniuq Jesus-aaq una, waten Qaneryaranek qanrutkumauq waten qanerluni:
This is what Jesus is like, it is told like this in the Bible saying this:

123
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:12,453
"Nutemtellrani Qaneryaraq uitallruuq, Qaneryaraq-llu Agayutmi uitallruuq, Qaneryaraq-llu Agayutnguluni."
"The Word was always there, and the Word was in God, and the Word was God."

Atam waten ayuqellinilria: ava-i qanelria Qaneryaraq nutemtellranek, ayagneranek qanerpek’nani.
Look, it’s like this: it just said when when the Word has always been, not talking about its beginning.

125
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:28,729
Atam Agayutem kenkiin angtataitetaciani tua-i waten, waten ayuqelliniluni, kitak’ atam taringluku:
Look, how there is nothing greater than God’s love, it’s like this, now understand it:

126
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:36,996
Tuani-gguq atam taum tanqia mat’um tanqian, tanqia anaggluku tanqingqertuq.
It says that there, you see, it’s light has a greater light than the light here.

127
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:44,774
Cali-llu taukuk atam iluani eluciq angnirluni nunaniq tua-i tau͡gaam camek avuunani.
Also, inside those is a shape that is happy and joyful but without anything added.

128
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:51,915
Tua-lli-wa cali waten yuarutetangqellria, yuarutni qaneryarartangqelalria:
Furthermore, there’s also a song like this, there are lyrics in a song:

129
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,369
Jesus-aaq-gguq agallrunrilkan tamarmi yuum yuucia tamaumayartuq.
It said that had Jesus not been hung, every person’s life would be lost.

130

Tua-i-ll’ Jesus-aaq atrallruan waten ayuqelliniluni: atam kenkiin angtataitetacia.
Then when Jesus came down, it was like this: look how there is nothing greater than his love.

131

Look at the light, the wonderful light, and the darkness below, miserable death, repulsive.

132
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:24,846

Furthermore, with the extent of God’s love, it truly seemed that he sent Jesus down right away.

133

It truly seems that he put [Jesus] over from the people of the land, put the people of the land closer to him with the greatest love.

134
00:15:33,218 --> 00:15:42,188
Ak’akika tua-i mat’umek au͡gna assikaqa-llu. Cangakenritaqa tua-i.
With so much for this, I like that one too. I don’t mind it.

135
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:52,520
