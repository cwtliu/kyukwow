00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:24,120

Then when he started making blackfish traps, he instruced me on the [asgurcuutet].

00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,200
Kuimteńi tamaani Qissunami asgurcuucirluni alerqualua taluyilartuq.
When he used an [asgurcuun] there in the Qissunaq river, he would instruct me as he fish trapped.

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:41,390
Cali tua-i pau͡gani kuicuarni kelumteńi uksuarmi aniullratni can’giircuutet civvluki.
Also, when the creeks inland from the main river snowed in the winter, he set the blackfish traps.

00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,150
Tua-i unugpak [?erneqir’uurturnaurtut].
They would [be set] all night [?into the day].

When I started going by myself, I would always try to heed his instructions.

Tua-llam caqerlua negirlua uatemteńi Qissunam ceńiini aqesgircuutnek, cukarak-llu kapuarrlukek.
Then one day, I set willow ptarmigan snares downriver from us on the banks of Qissunaq, and stuck the stakes.

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:18,300
Tua-i-ll’ maaten neganka takullemini piaqa ingna aqesgircuutemni ingna tungulria ingna tekicartu’rqa pekluni.
Then when I went to check on my willow ptarmigan snares, I found something black moving as I was about to reach it.

8
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,380
Napingalliniluni imarmiutaq.
Apparently, a mink had gotten caught.

9
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:31,140
Maaten imna pelacinaggaumilria-wa negaq tauna kepeksaitellia-llu.
I found that while the snare was also just twine, it didn’t cut it.

10
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,480
Qukamikun negalliniluni.
It had gotten snared in its middle.

11

Qaill’ tua-i picirkailamku kaugtuutarkamenk yuarlua tangvaglaamku ellii tuquciaqan imarmiutarnek.
Since I didn’t know what else to do, I looked for a club since I watched him kill minks.

12
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,770
Uyaqurrit, uyaqurrit teguqerluki qipngamni tua-i tangvaglaucimtun.
I took its neck and twisted it as I used to watch.

But it didn’t just die.

00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:04,070
Qiptulliniut wani qet’nge’rmeng, inglugtun tau͡gaam tegulriani nutaan.
They twist though they’re held, but [die] when held on either side.

15
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:14,700
Pinauraanga, "Tuaten-gguq pisciigataqata ircaqut qecuk’arluku tuqutellrat assinrulartuq." Alerqualua.
He’d tell me, "When they can’t die like that, it’s better to kill them by pulling their hearts." He instructed me.

16
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,860
Tua-i tuaten pituriluki.
I started doing that.

17
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:31,490

When I started trapping in the wilderness and mink is alive when I reach it, I’d pull out its heart, and they die right away.

However, when I come across a fox in a steel trap, I would watch him lift its head up and kill it by its neck.

19
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,890
Elliitun tua-i piuraqlua.
I do it like him.

Tuamta-ll’ nucirlua ayagyaurcama, alerqurnauraanga assi’irqan cella maligcuarturaqama kaviarnek
Then when I started traveling with a gun, he would instruct me when the weather was good while chasing a fox

21
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:34,170
"Pitsaqa’artevkenaku pitaqekuvgu assiqan cella caviggalgira’arluten amiirrarniaran tuani.
"Should you catch it when the weather’s good, bring a little knife and skin it there.

22
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,270
"Uqamalkutaqevkenaku kemga ut’ruqu’urniaran."
"Don’t weigh yourself down with its flesh and bring it home."

23
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,670

When I first did that, as I used to watch him

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:56,610
Pamyuit ullirtevkenaki, qaill’ piluki keggmaqaraqarraarluki man’a pamyuq nucuglaraa.
Without cutting the tail, he would somehow bite the tail and pull it out.

25
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,210
Tua-i au͡g’arnartuq im’ pamyuq cavkenani.
The tail would come off without a problem.

26
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:08,290
Tuatnaqarraallemni keggmaqtaryaaqekeka man’a qainga.
When I first did that, I tried biting the skin here.

27
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:20,430
When I pulled the tail, I think I only took off the fur, but the skin was left.
When I pulled the tail, I think I only took off the fur, but the skin was left.

So much of the tail fur stretched.

29
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:32,630

I wasn’t happy. After I gathered it, I brought it home.

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:42,130
Tauna-llu pamyua kepluku, enra kepluku piciqngaku elliin tekiskema.
And I cut that tail, cut the bone, because that’s what he used to do.

31
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,350
Tua-i tekicama mingqucelluki aanamnun tamakut amia au͡g’arraarluku.
When I arrived, I had my mother sew them on after I removed the skin.

32
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,830
She sewed the fur on and made it into a tail.
She sewed the fur on and made it into a tail.

He finally instructed me to cover them with something and bite deep inside

Until those skins come off.

However, when I catch a land otter, I can’t kill it when it’s alive.

36
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,530
Tuquqainayuituq, cenkaat.
It doesn’t easily die, land otters.

When I keep bashing them, some of them finally steadily die.

Mermiut pingrilnguut, mermiut piaqameng, eplalliniut egmianun mermetaqameng.
Non-aquatic animals apparently drown right away in water.

Tua-i tamakut pissuryarat alerquutai piyaurcama tua-i aturturluki.
When I started, I followed his instructions on hunting.

With the pounding drums, I heard them as the center beams up there cracking loudly as they split.

They said since my later father couldn’t do anything, he told me, "My goodness, he didn’t do something good to you. He scorned you.

00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,970
"Temliuq-am. Temlituuq. Temliluni piaten."
"He’s sleepwalking again. He sleepwalks. He did that to you sleepwalking."

He said it was fine. He said he was fine.

But Nick Beans didn’t say anything to me. I reached him and found that he was nodding as he was sitting.

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,430
Cunaw’ engelarciiganani yugyiimi qasgi.
It turned out he couldn’t laugh because there was a lot of people in the community house.

Since he watched me making Qupanuaq fall on his behind then.

They said it was hard because they were quiet. They couldn’t laugh in the community house because the shaman was practicing his powers in front of many people.

I felt very awkward because I couldn’t do anything since I sleepwalked there.

00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:21,730
Wangkutnek wii nallemnek tuar tang ayagluta wangkutnek man’a yuum ayallra cimilria.
From us, it seems that starting from my time, the way a person goes [through life] has changed.

309
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,130
Qaa?
Right?

310
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:29,090
Kass’atun makut kinguqliput ellirtut.
Our descendants have become Westernized.

311
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:35,770
Kass’arngariut, ilait-llu Yugtun taringesciigaliluteng.
They’ve become Westernized, and some can’t understand Yup’ik anymore.

312
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,550
Kass’aturrlainaq tau͡gaam qalarqurangluteng.
Instead, they’ve started speaking only in English.

313
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:48,710
Tua-ll’ waniw’ Yugtun yuullerkam ayuqucianek piyaaqengramta
And now, though we speak about how a Yup’ik life should go

314
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:54,940
Makut tamakut Kass’atun elitellriit qaillun elitnauqatarceta?
How will we teach those who’ve learned English?

315
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:05,400
Ataam-qaa au͡gna yuuqtallerput tengruluteng ataam ayagniryugngaciqaat?
Will they be able to enthusiastically start our old way of life again?

316
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,110
Caknerluta wangkuta yuullerput.
Our lives where we struggled.

317
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:17,070
Qimugtetgun-llu ayagaluta, kayimngina’arturluta-llu qugtatullruluta Akulmi.
And we’d travel by dog sled, and gather wood in the Akula region by pushing our sleds without dogs.

318
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,870
Qimugtaunata-llu ayagatullruluta.
And we used to travel without dogs.

319
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:31,550
Qanikciurutput-llu elluatuullruvkenateng, piqertuutaput-llu elluatuullruvkenateng wangkuta ciuqlirpeceńi.
And our shovels were not sophisticated, and our axes were not sophisticated, we who came before you.

320
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:39,380
Makut tua-llu-w’ nutaan ciuqliput nutaan tangrruarqamteng nutaan caknepiallruyugnarqut.
Now, especially when I imagine our elders, they probably struggled even more.

321
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:48,780
Ukatmun Kass’at tungiitnun calissuutait call’ tungiitnun ayallerput maliggluku tuarpiaq qacignariinarluteng cat.
As we went to becoming Westernised along with their tools, it truly seems that things have become easier.

322
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:53,710
Waniwa-ll’ yaaqsingraan wanirpaagaq tekiarcaurrluku
And now, though a place is far, we’ve started reaching it right away

323
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:58,840
Wangkuta unuakuyaarmek ayagluta caqtarturatullerput.
The place we’d steadily start going to from the early morning.

324
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,990

You understand?

325
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:35,340
Makut qanruyutait ciuliamta wangkuta qemagngangaicaaqaput elisngastaitni
We who are knowledgeable about our ancestors’ wisdom will not keep them to ourselves

326
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:41,030
Akaarnun nunami maani nangengqatnguata.
Because they help us to stand on this earth for a long time.

327
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:46,740
Kenkek’ngaput-qaa tuquyararaasqaput wangkuta yup’ut?
Do we wish an early death on our children whom we love?

328
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:54,100
Kenkekumteki makunek ciuliamta alerquutaitnek arcaqerluki qanrutarkaugaput.
If we love them, we must especially tell them about our ancestors’ traditional instructions.

329
00:46:54,100 --> 00:47:04,860
Tuamta-llu wangkuta Yugni alerquutengqertukut yuullgutput tamalkuita elluarrluki ciuniuresqelluki
Then, we Yupiit are instructed to welcome all of our fellow people well

330
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,670
Allakaukevkenaki, ilakuyulluta.
Without discrimination, but as a whole.

331

Kitumek kinkut imkut Alaska-m yui tuaten umyuallgutekluteng ilakuyulluki nangengqasqumaut.
No matter who they are, the people of Alaska are asked to stand together with one mind.

332
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:27,350
Mat’um ilii, mat’um-am agayumacim ilait waten qanertut:
Part of these, some of these religions say this:

333
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:32,110
"Wangkuta agayumacirput assirtuq tukniluni-llu."
"Our religion is good and powerful."

334
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,740
Tuaten pinrituq. Tuaten ayuqenrituq.
That’s not the case. That’s not what it’s like.

335
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:44,420
Ciuliamta ilakuyutiit navyunaicaaqerput wangkuta, piunriyunaunaku-llu.
We should not destroy our ancestors’ community mindset, or abolish it.

336
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:52,350
Una ilakuyun avaken ayagluni ciuliamta qanrutkaat kenkauguq.
This community mindset, our ancestors have said since long ago that it’s a form of love.

337

Kenka atunrilkumteggu maani unguvallemteńi qaill’ piluta anirtuumaciqceta?
If we don’t practice love as we live here, how will we be saved?

Allamek anirtuutaitukut.
We have no other salvation.

339
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:04,890
Ciuliamta kenka atullruat.
Our ancestors practiced love.

340
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:14,390
Anirtuumaluteng-llu ayaumaluteng tamana atullruamegteggu yuullgutmeggnun tamalkuitnun allakaukutevkenateng.
And they were saved as they went because they practiced that to all of their fellow people without discrimination.

341

Agayumacit ayuqenrilnguut allakaukucetaangraatkut, tamana allakaukucaraq assiituq uitacurlagnaqluni-llu.
Though various religions try to divide us, that division is not good and leads to unrest.

342

Ciuliamta tau͡gaam alerquutiit ilakuyucaraq atuqumteggu nutaan uitanqegciluta nangengqaciqukut
Only if we practice our ancestors’ community lifestyle will we stand peacefully

Ukverput-llu qaqimalriaruluni.
And our faith will be complete.

And our solid foundation here is worthy of great respect, and will not lose that.

We value a person’s name, their Yup’ik name.
