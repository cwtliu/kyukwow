1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,230
Alrighty.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,290
We’re rolling.

3
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,870
Ready?

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:20,885
Yes.

5
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:28,115
For the record, Nicholai and Olenka K. Nicholai of Kwethluk.

6
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:32,710
Qugiciq and Angut’aq.

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,950
Okay.

8
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:43,245
So, we came here to Kwethluk to ask about things of old.

9
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:50,515
Please ask your spouse this:

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,320
Did people long ago... no.

11
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:04,815
Were there a lot of settlements where people gathered her in the Kuskokwim?

12
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,875
You know, what are they now?

13
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:17,420
Urucararmiut, Bethel, Napaskiak, Oscarville, Tuntutuliak, Napakiak.

14
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:18,700
There are only several.

15
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,610
Were there a lot a long time ago?

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,600
He said, were there a lot of villages when you first became observant?

17
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:32,425
No, there weren’t a lot of people.

18
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:44,998
You see, when I was a boy at some height, I was probably this big, but I was observant, well, I had became aware.

19
00:01:45,842 --> 00:02:01,597
Down around Wass’ house, the furthest upriver.

20
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:13,276
And there was nothing here upriver from there, except for those wooden human figures.

21
00:02:14,436 --> 00:02:18,478
That was all there was.

22
00:02:18,907 --> 00:02:19,950
Graves.

23
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:26,632
Then (Graves.) since Dutch’s house was the furthest upriver

24
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:36,370
We had a house down there toward the water from there.

25
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:46,610
And my late grandfather, Kukikcaq, was the furthest upriver. That’s what I observed.

26
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:56,498
Those there, and we were not spread far apart.

27
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:04,448
Then here right behind it, right behind our house like this

28
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:18,462
The late father of Vera down there had a house, with my female blood relative as his spouse.

29
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:23,097
They had children.

30
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:37,265
Around that time

31
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:44,077
They celebrated Russian Christmas in my presence.

32
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:55,451
Then before anything happened before dawn, they had nothing left to do.

33
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:04,778
We celebrated Russian Christmas together then.

34
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:15,610
And out there when they came in, there didn’t seem to be anyone outside the house we went into.

35
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:34,598
We would go with the singers going first.

36
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:43,897
And they finished before dawn (I see.) without any mishaps.

37
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:47,317
Ask if those...

38
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:48,956
Over there...

39
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:51,335
Oh no, yes, what?

40
00:04:53,393 --> 00:05:04,150
When those crosses on the graves over there were not present

41
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:14,725
Down toward the water in the trees was the house furthest downriver.

42
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:23,723
Over there, do you know Paniluk?

43
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:34,142
Her father had a house like that among the trees.

44
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:38,986
He was apparently my great-uncle.

45
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:53,246
When I went in, though he teased me, I didn’t react because I didn’t know the custom.

46
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:56,334
It turned out that he would tease me.

47
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:10,163
There was also a path through the thickets for sleds.

48
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:19,220
It went down downriver on this side of the mouth of the river.

49
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:22,882
They wouldn’t use sleds down [toward the river].

50
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:26,544
That’s how I know it.

51
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:42,244
Please ask him, what did he think when he first saw these Caucasians?

52
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:50,436
He asked, what did you think when you first saw Caucasians?

53
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:59,188
I first saw a Caucasian, I went to school for a very short time.

54
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:10,808
It turned out that woman was going to be our teacher. They had called her something. I forgot.

55
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,148
Oh my, that woman.

56
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:31,513
In the fall at that time, the students, I would go over with my fellow children.

57
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:46,088
Then they ended it because they always climbed.

58
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:56,097
When we traveled at that time

59
00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:04,905
Apparently, it was down to the headwaters of the river by Quinhagak

60
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:09,244
When we had apparently traveled there.

61
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:14,970
There, we didn’t go downriver, but stayed there.

62
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:23,222
Apparently, when the one they called our mother was alive.

63
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:29,390
I don’t know when the other passed away.

64
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:41,399
But I have an early childhood memory in their, you know, graves.

65
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:47,088
When I told that story, they told me

66
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:55,860
They said that the one I saw was my father.

67
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:58,905
But I didn’t know what happened to him.

68
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:11,486
It turned out that when we went down to the headwaters of the river by Quinhagak without going downriver

69
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:15,698
We were there all summer.

70
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:23,838
I was there with my family.

71
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:27,178
There was no one else with us.

72
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:39,358
Because fish would go there, they fished when the fish came, and we had a store of fish.

73
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:44,452
It’s not like this [river]. Fish don’t come early there.

74
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:50,281
Apparently, fish don’t come early there.

75
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:59,789
We were there for five years. It seemed to be five as I remember it.

76
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:04,486
And I grew up to be in my prime.

77
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:10,171
I started hunting.

78
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:20,381
I started traveling by myself without any companions.

79
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:31,227
We also came here in the winter by sled.

80
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:43,887
We reached [?] inland, these spruce trees smell strong.

81
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:58,345
When we reached [?], I smelled the scent of these spruce trees.

82
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:10,258
It turns out they smell strong after being in a place without people for a long time.

83
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:27,466
At that time, the one they called out mother had an ailment in her blood.

84
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:33,967
We were here.

85
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:48,693
And in the fall, she passed away before it froze.

86
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:58,031
It’s terrible. I still remember my late mother to this day.

87
00:11:59,003 --> 00:12:00,931
It’s terrible.

88
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:07,265
It really seems that my eyes are closed.

89
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:15,901
And I stopped hearing little pieces of traditional wisdom after she left.

90
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:30,302
But before she passed away back then, she would always speak to us who were alive

91
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:41,231
After she passed away then, also because I didn’t go to school.

92
00:12:44,957 --> 00:12:59,543
One day, I decided to [?], and traveled because I would walk downriver to Napakiak.

93
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:14,604
And though I saw my fellow boys here, in my mind, I didn’t want to play with them.

94
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:24,815
When I reached Napakiak, I stood toward the river from that house and stayed.

95
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:35,734
As I stayed there, a woman came out. She wasn’t young and her hair was gray.

96
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:43,089
Then she went in, and I finally went to go in.

97
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:58,838
Then when I went in, I found that there was a man in there laying on a bed that wasn’t elevated.

98
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:08,710
When he saw me, he watched me and asked what I was there for.

99
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:13,674
I shook his hand.

100
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,029
He looked at me and asked, "What’s this? Where are you from?"

101
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:28,333
Then I told him that I was from Kwethluk.

102
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:44,444
When I said I was from Kwethluk, you see, he stayed still then got up from his bed.

103
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:55,722
When he got up, I sat across there across from him.

104
00:14:56,717 --> 00:15:02,774
At that time, I didn’t understand that.

105
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:13,154
Without a small voice, he said to me, "Person of Kwethluk, the people of Kwethluk."

106
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:29,158
After he said, "The people of Kwethluk," he talked about the poeple of Kwethluk.

107
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:38,780
He knew some of them.

108
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:44,502
He knew some of the ones I knew, and didn’t know some of them

109
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,354
Because apparently, he wouldn’t come to Kwethluk often.

110
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:58,781
He talked about when he came.

111
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:07,681
They always invited him to eat, they never let him stop.

112
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:12,406
Ask him to stop for a second. The battery is low.

113
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:18,963
Okay.

114
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:24,357
Are there no more great hunters these days?

115
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,884
He asked, are there no more great hunters these days?

116
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,653
Around these parts?

117
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,274
This time.

118
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:39,677
There’s no more what?

119
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:42,106
He asked, are there no more great hunters?

120
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,303
Well

121
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,245
People back then, I know.

122
00:16:51,805 --> 00:17:00,262
There’s going to be no more of the ones I observed back then.

123
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:05,198
Only one small man.

124
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:10,749
Do you know Nutarar? Do you know Amaqlicuar?

125
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:17,830
He’s become a little old man, got small. That’s him.

126
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:24,203
The elder of Kwethluk. There is no other elder.

127
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:30,314
Only [?] who are all young.

128
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:32,968
That’s him.

129
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:44,130
And just now, I went out and saw the poor guy sitting outside outside of the store.

130
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:51,165
He’s gotten small. How big is he now?

131
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:58,704
He had a lot of family, but [families] pass away.

132
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:07,447
But he has a woman for companion down there, his sibling.

133
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:16,018
I saw them when there was a lot of them.

134
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:19,529
They were mostly men.

135
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:30,606
They weren’t sedentary, were never sedentary. They would always travel when people always hunted.

136
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:51,108
And the poor one over there who stays all by himself

137
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:56,573
Ayapan’s child, Cucuaq.

138
00:18:57,305 --> 00:19:09,491
He also had a mother that was the female relative of Amaqlicuar.

139
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:14,757
That’s what I know. I knew him

140
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:22,064
He had a younger sibling, Anerniralria.

141
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:32,230
Some days, he would play with me and I would go to his house.

142
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:38,579
He would walk around no different from myself. I would play with him.

143
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:44,462
Then Olenka.

144
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:59,165
(Do these young people...) The mother of that one who stays all by himself...

145
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,233
Oh, okay.

146
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:16,133
These days, do young people not hear traditional wisdom anymore, and why?

147
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,250
Indeed, they don’t hear about traditional wisdom anymore.

148
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:21,477
Why?

149
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:25,659
They don’t hear people teaching anymore.

150
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:33,074
For us a long time ago, you see, whenever we did any little thing, these two would start speaking.

151
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:37,824
Now, they don’t know about traditional wisdom.

152
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:42,728
They only tell them in church.

153
00:20:47,447 --> 00:21:00,781
And this Yup’ik language, it seems that some elders say that it’s like it’s slowly getting lost.

154
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:07,039
Because it the ancient language of us Yupiit.

155
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:23,058
When the churches first came a long time ago, and brought forth this Bible

156
