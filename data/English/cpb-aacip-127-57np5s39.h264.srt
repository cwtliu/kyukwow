1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:07,710
The ones here are the bowls they use for fish.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,600
They’re different sizes.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:22,970
Their children would have small ones like these, and the bigger ones, their parents would have bigger ones like these.

4
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:27,545
They filled them with various foods.

5
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:42,912
They even cooked horsetail. Now, they make cooked horstails from the plants that grow in ponds.

6
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:54,919
And the [?] blood, they would add blood from sea animals to the water there.

7
00:00:55,532 --> 00:01:01,444
That was good cooked horsetail. Those who knew would make them well.

8
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:15,732
These various ways today of making soup, what we call soup

9
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:19,045
But they’re not the same.

10
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:26,339
The smell of what our ancestors made were completely different.

11
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:39,683
And they would gather them, including the food voles gathered in the ground

12
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:47,734
Including what they call mare’s-tail tubers, and what they call tall cottongrass.

13
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:53,197
They would add those to their soups.

14
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:56,197
And like this...

15
00:01:56,228 --> 00:02:09,791
These various masks like this are asked to be made by those whom they call shamans.

16
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:13,541
They ask for various masks to be made.

17
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:28,091
They, only the shamans, asked for these various masks to made with only a single eye on each.

18
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:31,872
And these Cupiit would not be done with them like this.

19
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:38,122
These would be used when we practiced traditional dancing.

20
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:43,297
They would have to use them, and called them masks.

21
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:45,816
Do you what the one above was?

22
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:48,716
I don’t know what this was.

23
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:52,578
And these were different.

24
00:02:53,072 --> 00:03:02,297
But these are different. I don’t know what these here are.

25
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:04,091
What about the bottom?

26
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:14,129
From what I saw about these here

27
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:25,654
You know, we have names for everything, even if they seem insignificant or unimportant.

28
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:37,205
This had a name, one of them had the name of the spirit of a fish, sometimes had the name of the spirit of a living being.

29
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:47,286
Their shamans would instruct them to add those for their rituals when they were going to use them in mask ceremonies.

30
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:54,230
They would also speak about them when they were going to go out to dance.

31
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:56,505
Those shamans?

32
00:03:56,518 --> 00:04:00,230
Those shamans, and the Cupiit wouldn’t.

33
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:10,218
But even though these are not their helping spirits, they would put these as decoration.

34
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:17,275
They would also always decorate these parts of the long-tailed ducks like this.

35
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:40,287
And the living being on land that I’m looking at here is one of the animals of the land.

36
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,419
But I’ve never seen the ones up there before.

37
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:53,419
But up there on it’s forehead, it needs to have ears.

38
00:04:53,425 --> 00:05:00,938
These living things have different ears that are visible.

39
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:06,488
[?] bring these up.

40
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:12,769
I don’t see anyone with those up there in these villages.

41
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:25,269
I’ve never seen these before, but the ones who make them decorate them.

42
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:29,145
What would they do when they used it?

43
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:38,007
When they were going to use it, they would explain what it is, saying what it is.

44
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:45,370
They also called these the spirits of thigns. They called them spirits.

45
00:05:48,075 --> 00:06:03,962
And these here, I think they say that this is the spirit of some living thing, a marine animal.

46
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:08,575
The one around it like this

47
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:25,713
You know when they surface, the ones that surface are sometimes up to here, sometimes up to here, sometimes up to here, and can have their mouths here.

48
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:35,888
However, this is supposed to have a crooked mouth here.

49
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:42,213
It’s supposed to have teeth like this.

50
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:56,026
And these across from each other, this animal would eat them when it’s hungry.

51
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:06,695
I don’t see hands like that.

52
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:14,327
Everything has hands that don’t go up to five that are like this.

53
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:25,258
But the maker made it in their way like this.

54
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:34,402
We look at it with awe.

55
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:44,990
Since they’re made for shamans, we Cupiit cannot watch them because they’re made for shamans.

56
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:52,146
Even we try to understand this, I will not understand it.

57
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:03,802
They would say that this was a certain thing.

58
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:14,065
And they would always do it like this with their hands here. It’s hands are here.

59
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:24,490
And if it’s hungry, it will take these things around the hands and it can eat it with its hands.

60
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:27,065
Do you understand it?

61
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,315
Yes.

62
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:47,190
I used to only hear of them long ago. I’ve never seen one finished like this.

63
00:08:47,591 --> 00:09:03,078
Because some people would make two mouths like this

64
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:12,016
They would make two of them on the chin here.

65
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:22,778
And then if they found something very strange and if they thought it was something scary

66
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:34,129
They would depict them being removed from the top, then being removed from the bottom, removing them with increasing speed.

67
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:43,792
They called the ones on the bottom cegtullret. They called them cegtullret.

68
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,092
Is that all? (Yes.)

69
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:53,136
I don’t see too much of those that [?].

70
00:09:57,386 --> 00:10:00,599
But they’re also different.

71
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:08,799
There were also different kinds of marine animals that we didn’t see long ago.

72
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:19,774
Now, however, we don’t commonly see them anymore, becoming very rare, becoming rare, and some [?have low populations].

73
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:29,062
This part that goes like this seems to be a large ice floe.

74
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:36,893
It will go on the large ice floe.

75
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:42,562
But I don’t understand what this is.

76
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:49,231
What is it? What is it?

77
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,707
What’s the angenqaq?

78
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:56,064
What is it?

79
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:57,127
Angenqaq.

80
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:58,726
What’s an angenqaq?

81
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:09,426
You know, the thick ice that goes toward land from far out in the ocean, sometimes thick. Those are called angenqat.

82
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,539
(Tagenqat.) Angenqat. (Angenqat.) Angenqat.

83
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:27,608
However, the one that comes from the north that breaks easily, some of them are cekullallret, cekullaq.

84
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:37,358
But even if I try to explain these, I have no idea about it, even the eyes like this.

85
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:46,227
But this, I think that this is something on land here.

86
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:54,327
Its mouth here is round in the face.

87
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:12,408
I think they would always put water beside us in the fall and spring

88
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:16,677
They would tell us sleep like that long ago, and I used to as well.

89
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:26,677
They would tell me to sleep in the fall with water beside me, even just filling a cup and placing it by me.

90
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:32,815
Then he would tell me to put something, even a kettle.

91
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:46,259
They say that this creature uses its mouth, bends down to a sleeping person, and eats him with that.

92
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:55,053
It will suck him dry. It will suck him dry.

93
00:12:55,866 --> 00:13:10,128
And then the one that was sucked dry by this cannot breathe like this, cannot live.

94
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:12,716
That’s getting sucked dry by Meriiq.

95
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:16,454
One is instructed to always have water nearby.

96
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:28,529
And when they notice them jumping, when they jump into the water, they don’t splash, but they [?].

97
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:31,916
Is that all? (Yes.)

98
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:35,991
...but it has no tail.

99
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:43,511
This is actually a fish but it has no tail, and doesn’t have those things.

100
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:54,361
This one too seems to be complete with a tail. Its tail is up there.

101
00:13:56,701 --> 00:14:02,111
This isn’t supposed to have [?] like this as well.

102
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:06,431
It’s a fish [?].

103
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:12,991
It’s also because the fish that swim down in the ocean like this are different.

104
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:25,346
And through my understanding with that, after having no idea what it was, I recognize it with this one’s mouth.

105
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:31,251
Long ago, they would suck out the water from them at night.

106
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:37,701
Would the shamans use those? (Yes.)

107
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:46,786
But when they used this fish mask, it would never be without a tail because they are shamans.

108
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:59,906
I don’t know about this. I don’t know.

109
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:08,570
I have no idea about htis. I can’t talk about the one with this on its forehead.

110
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:18,780
The people on the Yukon, when I spoke to them, thye said that it belonged to one of the Yukon shamans.

111
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:23,195
They say they have owners.

112
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:35,810
But in my village down there, because there weren’t just single shamans

113
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:48,975
When they reveal or explain things, they would use metaphors, they would use metaphors.

114
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:59,380
The ones I see wouldn’t have these white things.

115
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:10,005
But when they makers had them made, they would decorate them with little creatures.

116
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,930
I’ve never once heard of any with one.

117
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:24,830
The ones around it, it seems that it would have two eyes.

118
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:32,370
Maybe I should get Peter to hold the mic. Would that be better? Peter, would you hold this one too? I think it might work better.

119
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:38,355
I’ve never seen anything with four eyes like this.

120
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,780
It’s a little different from what would be a half-seal mermaid.

121
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:52,715
If this had one single eye, and this was sharp, sharp like this, if it were this sharp

122
00:16:53,065 --> 00:17:02,165
And a mouth under that sharp part, it’s supposed to have a small mouth.

123
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:08,560
The maker seemed to make those to remember those.

124
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,100
What, is that wood down in the middle?

125
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:14,025
No.

126
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:27,305
These half-seal mermaids have decorations like this depicted seal gut rain parkas.

127
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:39,260
We had one of those down at home with a seal gut rain parka, a seal gut rain parka [fastened] like this.

128
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:47,405
I have no idea what this is either.

129
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:57,790
This one has what are supposed to be arms about to take this.

130
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:07,285
These here surface in the ocean. These surface in the ocean.

131
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,450
And up there are their back flippers, these ones.

132
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:18,770
And these are their foreflippers.

133
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:28,010
I think the one around it depicts water.

134
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:38,725
I have nothing more to say about what I know.
