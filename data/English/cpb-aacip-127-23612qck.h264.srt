1
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:24,120
Then when he started making blackfish traps, he instruced me on the [asgurcuutet].

2
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,200
When he used an [asgurcuun] there in the Qissunaq river, he would instruct me as he fish trapped.

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:41,390
Also, when the creeks inland from the main river snowed in the winter, he set the blackfish traps.

4
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,150
They would [be set] all night [?into the day].

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,710
When I started going by myself, I would always try to heed his instructions.

6
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:05,290
Then one day, I set willow ptarmigan snares downriver from us on the banks of Qissunaq, and stuck the stakes.

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:18,300
Then when I went to check on my willow ptarmigan snares, I found something black moving as I was about to reach it.

8
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,380
Apparently, a mink had gotten caught.

9
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:31,140
I found that while the snare was also just twine, it didn’t cut it.

10
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,480
It had gotten snared in its middle.

11
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:45,960
Since I didn’t know what else to do, I looked for a club since I watched him kill minks.

12
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,770
I took its neck and twisted it as I used to watch.

13
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,550
But it didn’t just die.

14
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:04,070
They twist though they’re held, but [die] when held on either side.

15
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:14,700
He’d tell me, "When they can’t die like that, it’s better to kill them by pulling their hearts." He instructed me.

16
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,860
I started doing that.

17
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:31,490
When I started trapping in the wilderness and mink is alive when I reach it, I’d pull out its heart, and they die right away.

18
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:45,840
However, when I come across a fox in a steel trap, I would watch him lift its head up and kill it by its neck.

19
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,890
I do it like him.

20
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:23,750
Then when I started traveling with a gun, he would instruct me when the weather was good while chasing a fox

21
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:34,170
"Should you catch it when the weather’s good, bring a little knife and skin it there.

22
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,270
"Don’t weigh yourself down with its flesh and bring it home."

23
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,670
When I first did that, as I used to watch him

24
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:56,610
Without cutting the tail, he would somehow bite the tail and pull it out.

25
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,210
The tail would come off without a problem.

26
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:08,290
When I first did that, I tried biting the skin here.

27
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:20,430
When I pulled the tail, I think I only took off the fur, but the skin was left.

28
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,290
So much of the tail fur stretched.

29
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:32,630
I wasn’t happy. After I gathered it, I brought it home.

30
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:42,130
And I cut that tail, cut the bone, because that’s what he used to do.

31
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,350
When I arrived, I had my mother sew them on after I removed the skin.

32
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,830
She sewed the fur on and made it into a tail.

33
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:02,760
He finally instructed me to cover them with something and bite deep inside

34
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,930
Until those skins come off.

35
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,320
However, when I catch a land otter, I can’t kill it when it’s alive.

36
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,530
It doesn’t easily die, land otters.

37
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:31,180
When I keep bashing them, some of them finally steadily die.

38
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:41,380
Non-aquatic animals apparently drown right away in water.

39
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:49,100
When I started, I followed his instructions on hunting.

40
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:59,880
And even if he’s gone, he instructed me to do that according to his instruction.

41
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:34,360
When Peqiciraq’s father starting going with me before he passed away, Peqiciraq’s father downriver

42
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,790
He brought me deep in to the wilderness far away by dog sled.

43
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,610
I followed him.

44
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:48,370
We’d go around [?] and hunted.

45
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:58,420
And when we went down there, going around Qucilgaq, we’d [hunt] there.

46
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,710
Okay, keep speaking, don’t stop. (What?) Keep speaking.

47
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:14,490
When we went around Qucilgaq by dog sled, nothing would happen.

48
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:24,970
But when I went with him in the spring by kayak, because he would set up spring camp downriver from us where they called it Quuqaq

49
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:31,770
When my late father arrived, he told him

50
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:39,430
"Take him downriver. His brother won’t travel with him, " referring to Eritailnguq.

51
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:46,370
"Take him to your village downriver. Go downriver." He told me to follow along.

52
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,600
When we went around Qucilgaq by kayak

53
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,730
When we first did it, we’d look for portage routes.

54
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,640
When we cut inland through there and came up on a lake

55
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:10,780
We’d look for portage route through there, to the headwaters of what they called Elurtuli.

56
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:18,210
When we went down to it, since the currrent was strong, we went downriver.

57
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:27,950
And when it widened downriver, we started rowing side by side hunting for muskrats.

58
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:35,850
As we went, we’d sometimes pass land otters swimming there.

59
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:46,430
Then as we saw land otters, we appeared on them going up to the land through the snow.

60
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,850
There were four, apparently with their mother.

61
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,810
He said to me, "Okay, they’re going through there probably because it’s a portage route."

62
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,280
We followed them.

63
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,720
I took my gun, left my kayak, and followed them.

64
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:14,880
When I saw them upriver, they went to a pond. We went around the pond.

65
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,300
When they went out up there, we went to them.

66
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:29,620
I arrived there and found tracks on the portage route. And they went down to the river again, here to Elurtuli.

67
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,530
They noticed me when they saw me.

68
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,930
Those land otters [?] when they appear.

69
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:47,040
When they appeared coming closer, they growled, even their mother.

70
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:53,420
I shot it, but didn’t instantly kill it.

71
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:04,310
When he didn’t go, since he went up to the grassy area across from me, I went to get my kayak.

72
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,360
He was waiting for me.

73
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:16,550
He said to me, "If they go down to the river, it’s part of this. I will go around rowing. You portage through there with them."

74
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,290
Though their mother died across there, I hoped he’d come across it.

75
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,220
I crossed. I portaged through the route.

76
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:59,010
When I got to it and lowered my kayak, I saw that it hadn’t died yet.

77
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:05,060
When I reached it, it went down, but it wasn’t doing very well.

78
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,180
Since I had a .22 and it was close, I shot it again and caught it.

79
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:17,410
Its young, however, were popping up around me here.

80
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,440
I tried shooting at them.

81
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,420
Since I was in too much of a hunting frenzy, they ran away from me. I lost them.

82
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,360
[I only caught] their mother.

83
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,310
I waited for my companion.

84
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,850
He tarried since that point was far.

85
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,250
He made a [gun] popping sound over there not far away.

86
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,510
He said when he arrived that he passed one land otter there and shot.

87
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:04,380
He said to me, "I think it’s one of those young ones. It’s not young. It’s big."

88
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:15,500
When I lost those young, he said to me, "We should go inland and set up camp on the tundra since we rowed all night.

89
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:26,590
"Let’s set up camp inland on the tundra and bring up our kayaks." We unloaded and brought them up.

90
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:36,200
We gathered willows there. We made a kettle of hot water and drank something hot. The weather was calm.

91
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:48,070
As we were there, he said to me, "Look, something that’s not a muskrat appeared downriver. The wake of something is coming from downriver."

92
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:54,340
I saw that it left a big wake. It wasn’t a muskrat.

93
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:02,860
When it appeared and went inland, it didn’t appear again.

94
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,700
He said to me, "Take down your kayak and check where it went downriver."

95
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:18,240
I reached where its wake ended, and found a portage route here.

96
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:26,920
I docked there, took the .22, and went inland along it.

97
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:37,650
I went down to a pond far inland, and something black down on the ice would move.

98
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,400
It was that thing.

99
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:50,610
It would split into two, then come together again.

100
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,450
That one who had shamanistic powers whom they called Qupanuaq

101
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:28,280
He’s excercised his shamanistic powers in front of me more than once.

102
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,890
One time, I followed people to Cuukvagtuli, and he was there.

103
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:43,190
When they had him call upon his spirit helpers in the community house, and my late father went since he was a singer

104
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,890
They drummed side by side since they sang in the community house.

105
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,530
I fell asleep [betwen] those two drummers.

106
00:14:52,930 --> 00:15:02,090
I fell asleep between Nick Beans beside me, and my older brother.

107
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:11,610
I woke up to the community house here cracking loudly, the center beams up there splitting and caving in.

108
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:19,480
That was all I awoke to. I had apparently had a lucid dream.

109
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:29,990
With the pounding drums, I heard them as the center beams up there cracking loudly as they split.

110
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,310
I had the thought to run out.

111
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:42,220
I got up as he was saying his shamanistic incantation at the door, with [the patient] covered with a seal gut rain parka.

112
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,820
And these two dancers were standing.

113
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:56,950
They said that when I reached the shaman incanting, I took him here, pulled, and he fell on his behind down on the floor plank.

114
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:08,460
They said since my later father couldn’t do anything, he told me, "My goodness, he didn’t do something good to you. He scorned you.

115
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,970
"He’s sleepwalking again. He sleepwalks. He did that to you sleepwalking."

116
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:22,350
They said when Qupanuaq sat up, he said, "If he’s sleepwalking, if he did it in his sleep, he didn’t scorn me."

117
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,360
He said it was fine. He said he was fine.

118
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,610
I regretted it. When I went in, I ran out.

119
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:44,530
But Nick Beans didn’t say anything to me. I reached him and found that he was nodding as he was sitting.

120
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,430
It turned out he couldn’t laugh because there was a lot of people in the community house.

121
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,920
He only did this, not staying still.

122
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,580
He found it funny, but couldn’t laugh.

123
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:04,610
I lay down again and was asleep for good.

124
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,880
And the next day, they didn’t tell me there.

125
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,960
Only when we returned to Cuqartalek, Nick Beans told my late mother the story

126
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,820
Since he watched me making Qupanuaq fall on his behind then.

127
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:32,240
They said it was hard because they were quiet. They couldn’t laugh in the community house because the shaman was practicing his powers in front of many people.

128
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:40,960
And when I reached the two dancers, I pushed them to the side and ran out.

129
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,360
Since I was barefoot, when my feet got cold in the door of the entry porch, I woke up.

130
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:57,400
Someone behind me pulled me from my back. I looked back and saw that my late older brother was pulling me inside.

131
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:07,780
I felt very awkward because I couldn’t do anything since I sleepwalked there.

132
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:15,730
Only when I arrived did Nick Beans tell my late mother the story.

133
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:52,300
We women had traditional wisdom not to wanter in the evening, and not to have guests.

134
00:18:52,620 --> 00:19:04,040
This was important [wisdom] from my mother, my mother and father:

135
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:10,740
They said I shouldn’t listen to people speaking bad things.

136
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:22,280
Then if I see someone giving instruction, if I see something giving instruction

137
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:31,970
They told me to go and listen to the one speaking about admonishments.

138
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,330
They were peaceful back then.

139
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,840
But these things that traditional wisdom speaks about

140
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:50,550
We come to the time spoken about. You, live carefully.

141
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Try to be careful

142
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:04,680
So that you will not be surprised but recognize what you come across, and not be taken aback though you do not find it right.

143
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:15,950
And this man or woman that speaks harshly, one who speaks loudly

144
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,940
They do not like that.

145
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:34,010
And speaking harshly to this young boy with people listening without regard to how he will react

146
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:41,810
They said something was wrong with it.

147
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,920
These days

148
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:56,890
Because I remember our traditional wisdom and struggle with my grandchildren or my children here

149
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,870
Since I remember it and struggle

150
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:14,530
I think that person who shouts, who speaks loudly, is not good.

151
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,570
In my earliest memories, the poeple back then used to tell me

152
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,460
That I should try to live mindfully and wisely.

153
00:21:51,960 --> 00:22:04,210
Then when I grew up and started traveling here, and went with those traveling by dog team, they would tell me this:

154
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:15,990
Watch, they said, when I became able and start catching animals from the wilderness and from the ocean down there

155
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,880
They said if I keep this one sealskin with me

156
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:30,440
Watch, they said, there will be more, and when they eventually become enough for a kayak, I will get a kayak.

157
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:39,230
Then they said that if I catch a mink or a muskrat in the wilderness inland

158
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,590
Watch, they said, if I save the money without handing it over right away

159
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:54,530
They said I would do well if I use it for something later when I add to it.

160
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:07,430
"If you are mindless, you will go forth coveting those around you

161
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:13,880
"Though those around you get their hands on what they need."

162
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:23,590
Since I’m apparently mindless, though those around me got their hands on things, I coveted them for a long time.

163
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:06,770
He apparently didn’t save up what money he got through checks.

164
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:15,100
If he saves what money he gets though the checks are small

165
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,980
When they amass, he’d be able to pay for a snow machine.

166
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:30,530
And he’d be able to pay for a boat motor.

167
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:41,070
It’s no wonder they told us that letting what money we have pass by, letting it pass by right away by spending it

168
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:50,160
Getting things we want inside stores, giving in to our first inclinations too much.

169
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:55,990
They said if we let what little money we have pass by, we won’t have things.

170
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:03,190
We won’t get an expensive boat, and we won’t get an expensive motor.

171
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:12,430
And they said if we drink alcohol, we will not wear expensive clothes

172
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:19,460
Becuase, they said, we squander what we would have traded for what we need.

173
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:28,280
As I’ve become an old man like this, I’m seeing that traditional wisdom that was passed down to us.

174
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,120
People back then didn’t give random instructions.

175
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:44,350
Instead, the give instruction on what they’ve experienced before us.

176
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:55,530
And sometimes, they wouldn’t hide their mistakes, and admonish us against committing their mistakes.

177
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:36,080
The many pieces of wisdom of our instructors, one among them would add this wisdom when they wanted to, what they call jealousy.

178
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:46,230
They said that a jealous shaman envies a person who is living and subsisting well

179
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:55,310
They curse them to be bad hunters, or break the wealth of those who were going to live well.

180
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,330
They have very malicious intentions.

181
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:05,540
Then these other pieces of traditional wisdom:

182
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:16,840
They said that though those among us depreciate us, saying we young people here are lazy

183
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:25,190
And at night, since I stop going out at night when it gets dark because I lost my mother early

184
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:34,150
They would give me a harrowing promise, that if I’m lazy like this that I would be a beggar.

185
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:44,770
They said that that would bring me misfortune if I’m lazy when those around me take husbands because I desire what they have so much.

186
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:54,480
But our thorough instructors would tell us that.

187
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:07,570
Among those around us, we shouldn’t act senselessly, [?], be unobservant, or be foolish among those around us.

188
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:13,300
When they got up, they’d always tell us

189
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,710
"When you young people also have children

190
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:28,590
"Though your child seems small, or if you admonish them when you put on their skin boots, ’If you peers do anything to you, run away [?and do not fight them].’

191
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,520
"Watch, they pay attention."

192
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:40,330
They said that our elders keep what they’ve heard in their earliest memories.

193
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:16,160
They would tell us that a married couple living on their own back when there was no Western contact

194
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,740
If their father finishes a sled

195
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:31,280
And if he finishes the wooden sled, and keeps a small axe and ice pick

196
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:41,820
They said they will have things at hand though the family’s dear father is poor.

197
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:51,590
And they said that if he keeps the fishing tool that catches sticklebacks

198
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,030
And they said that if he makes fish traps that can catch fish out of straight grained pieces of wood

199
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:05,630
And if he sets fish traps that can catch minks

200
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:13,180
Though he’s poor, if the family’s father is like he’s rich [in food and tools]

201
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:23,120
He will take care of his children with abundance though they have tattered clothes all the way until they become strong.

202
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:30,750
This was the traditional wisdom passed down to us before Western contact.

203
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:39,720
I also used to see people like us who are poor.

204
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:52,170
You see, only some who have male children falsly say that they are poor.

205
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:59,730
When their sons start hunting fur-bearing animals

206
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:08,020
Their dear father would quickly get rich when fur was expensive.

207
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:13,960
Also, when they bring in animals from the [ocean] down there

208
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:20,830
We forget they’d been poor, and covet them.

209
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:29,730
When their father takes good care of them by not letting what they obtained pass by

210
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,420
Instead, giving them away when they’ve amassed.

211
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:46,380
Then they’d say that there may be brothers in this family who are five great hunters

212
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:53,980
And they said a married couple may have one son.

213
00:31:54,310 --> 00:32:01,990
They said that their son here wants to be like the great hunter brothers.

214
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:09,420
If he’s not lazy and competes with them without their knowledge when hunting

215
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,610
They said he would get as much as these five great hunters.

216
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:21,760
They said it’s easy to compete with great hunters without their knowledge.

217
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,210
They said that these brothers argue.

218
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:34,790
"Tell him to drift net; I don’t want to drift ent." "Tell him to gather wood; I don’t want to gather wood."

219
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:39,990
They said this is what it means when it’s easy to begin [competing with them].

220
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:45,600
They said that even this one person can be like them.

221
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:53,390
These are the things they told us in our early memories before Western contact.

222
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:31,410
And following the growth of these unmarried young ladies, they would cover them with instructions and admonishments.

223
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:43,770
And they would admonish them against ever going to meet a young man at night when people aren’t watching.

224
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:53,680
They also told us not to meet with young ladies at night.

225
00:33:55,060 --> 00:34:07,470
They said that if we’re confident in touching a girl’s flesh because people aren’t watching, we’ll kill ourselves.

226
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,730
We pretend to have a wife.

227
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,500
You see, they would speak of that to make it scary.

228
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,100
And when these women menstruate at home, they’d tell them

229
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,350
"Now, from here on out, you go forth.

230
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:34,210
"Never pass an unmarried young man, a boy, upwind from him, but over there downwind from him.

231
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:44,610
"When he smells your emanations, he will keep smelling it. Eventually, it ruins him."

232
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,610
Wouldn’t they tell you that?

233
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,510
They would tell us.

234
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,180
Don’t you recognize that?

235
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,370
No, I completely recognize it.

236
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,070
They say he smells her emanations.

237
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:31,460
They’d tell us to love our spouses, to attend to our husbands

238
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,610
And never be unfaithful.

239
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:41,560
And if we women start going out without our husbands’ knowledge

240
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,850
They said we’d eventually be pregnant from someone other than our husband.

241
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:58,000
When they instructed us in our earliest memories, we found that they would pry out extremeply improper things as they spoke to us.

242
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,200
And when they’d watch us, we who are listening would think like this:

243
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,720
"Wow, that one across there apparently knows us, has seen us."

244
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:15,090
They spoke to us as if they completely knew us, as if they truly had seen us.

245
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:22,360
It turned out that those who wished to speak would cleanse their hearts of their experiences.

246
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:28,530
The dear ones would speak to us so that a person would go [through life] well.

247
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:33,180
And when we have these dear children

248
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:40,610
They told us to never bring them, and not to hold their hands to have them visit other houses.

249
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,000
They said they’d become mischievous.

250
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:51,110
They said their misbehavior would exacerbate our destitution for the mother who stays with them at home.

251
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:56,210
Our father travels to try to subsist for us.

252
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:03,850
They said we women should be thankful for whatever he catches and welcome them.

253
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:13,830
Or if he gets a little money, we woman should not be angry wanting a beautiful dress, or some beautiful shoes

254
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:19,650
Because they said we’re standing here with wonderful clothes they’ve gotten us.

255
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:26,480
They said those are detrimental for our spouses.

256
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,070
Those things they obtain, we should work skillfully with what our spouses obtain.

257
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,900
As our dear spouses work dextrously, help them.

258
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:44,220
They said we shouldn’t squander those things, taking his money and going.

259
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:51,420
And as we go, when we come across socially inappropriate things, or drink, or something

260
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,350
They’d admonish us against all of those dangerous things.

261
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:02,650
And they told us not to be like that in front of our children. They said we’d teach them.

262
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:35,210
May a person live without exacerbating [problems] like that these days.

263
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,890
That was their harrowing promise

264
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:46,620
They said if we misbehave when our parents who instruct us, and our elders instruct us

265
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:51,030
They said if we we misbehave, we’ll become insensitive.

266
00:38:51,030 --> 00:39:00,950
We stop paying attention to our teachers, our instrcuts, who tell us to live well, not to hinder those around us.

267
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:06,020
Instead, they said we should be good and look nice sitting at home

268
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,750
So, they said, our house will be nice to be in.

269
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:16,790
And if a helpless guest comes in our house, try to make them feel at home

270
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,860
If we live without, you know, being mischievous.

271
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:32,050
When they said that, though we wanted to, yet we would sometimes come upon things.

272
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,650
We do not fulfill our desire to do well.

273
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:44,250
And it would very scary to be impregnated at a young age, to bring forth a child.

274
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,520
They said illegitimate children were very embarrassing.

275
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,790
It was an admonishment.

276
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:56,050
This is the misbehavior that our elders back then spoke of.

277
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:04,810
You young people shouldn’t do these bad things that are admonished against.

278
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,730
Do not follow these Western ways too much.

279
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:17,760
And since they speak of marijuana, that it has negative effects

280
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,650
Don’t use those.

281
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,980
You see, we only have a short life like this.

282
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:32,970
Though our youth and earliest memories seems close, yet we weaken like this and can’t do anything strenuous.

283
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:40,030
That’s what you should be careful like that, not only following those bad things.

284
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:48,770
If you are buy, subsist, and try to earn money with fervor, we will be thankful for you.

285
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:56,820
Instead, use the money you earn for yourselves, your houses, use them for help, and for clothes.

286
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:07,460
And since I don’t know how to speak English, I am not in awe of it in any way because I don’t use it.

287
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:15,610
Only when they really want me to, and when my spouse across there goes with me, I take something

288
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:19,710
Because I have no idea how to give out this [money].

289
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:26,400
I’m very thankful. I’m thankful that I don’t know because I stay peacefully.

290
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:57,630
It’s not good for you to abuse this alcohol.

291
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:06,270
Instead, this alcohol only leads to trouble.

292
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:15,490
Also, when a person drinks too much, they go the wrong way and bring themselves to misfortune.

293
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,260
The other one also, smoking...

294
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,210
Close it.

295
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:33,590
That other one, smoking, only goes to the mind, along with this body.

296
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:43,820
I don’t use it [or know] what it’s like, but because I hear about what that smoking is like

297
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:48,160
That it only destroys the mind.

298
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,820
Also, that one who smokes too much starts sleeping all the time.

299
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:59,040
That’s what I hear when they smoke that.

300
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,170
I think that truly does happen.

301
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:09,150
One who smokes too much sleeps all the time.

302
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:14,000
[They] also [become] forgetful, you know?

303
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:21,460
They forgot what to do. And after they put something down, they immediately forget them.

304
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:28,130
One of my sons like that, though I admonish them

305
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:32,280
Since they sometimes use that

306
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,600
I harshly scold them to the best of my ability.

307
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:08,740
From us, one of them told me yesterday, I think it was [?Ayapqu]gcaraq

308
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:21,730
From us, it seems that starting from my time, the way a person goes [through life] has changed.

309
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,130
Right?

310
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:29,090
Our descendants have become Westernized.

311
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:35,770
They’ve become Westernized, and some can’t understand Yup’ik anymore.

312
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,550
Instead, they’ve started speaking only in English.

313
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:48,710
And now, though we speak about how a Yup’ik life should go

314
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:54,940
How will we teach those who’ve learned English?

315
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:05,400
Will they be able to enthusiastically start our old way of life again?

316
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,110
Our lives where we struggled.

317
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:17,070
And we’d travel by dog sled, and gather wood in the Akula region by pushing our sleds without dogs.

318
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,870
And we used to travel without dogs.

319
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:31,550
And our shovels were not sophisticated, and our axes were not sophisticated, we who came before you.

320
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:39,380
Now, especially when I imagine our elders, they probably struggled even more.

321
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:48,780
As we went to becoming Westernised along with their tools, it truly seems that things have become easier.

322
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:53,710
And now, though a place is far, we’ve started reaching it right away

323
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:58,840
The place we’d steadily start going to from the early morning.

324
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,990
You understand?

325
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:35,340
We who are knowledgeable about our ancestors’ wisdom will not keep them to ourselves

326
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:41,030
Because they help us to stand on this earth for a long time.

327
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:46,740
Do we wish an early death on our children whom we love?

328
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:54,100
If we love them, we must especially tell them about our ancestors’ traditional instructions.

329
00:46:54,100 --> 00:47:04,860
Then, we Yupiit are instructed to welcome all of our fellow people well

330
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,670
Without discrimination, but as a whole.

331
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:18,920
No matter who they are, the people of Alaska are asked to stand together with one mind.

332
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:27,350
Part of these, some of these religions say this:

333
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:32,110
"Our religion is good and powerful."

334
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,740
That’s not the case. That’s not what it’s like.

335
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:44,420
We should not destroy our ancestors’ community mindset, or abolish it.

336
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:52,350
This community mindset, our ancestors have said since long ago that it’s a form of love.

337
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:59,320
If we don’t practice love as we live here, how will we be saved?

338
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,770
We have no other salvation.

339
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:04,890
Our ancestors practiced love.

340
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:14,390
And they were saved as they went because they practiced that to all of their fellow people without discrimination.

341
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:24,780
Though various religions try to divide us, that division is not good and leads to unrest.

342
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:33,860
Only if we practice our ancestors’ community lifestyle will we stand peacefully

343
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:37,320
And our faith will be complete.

344
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:13,000
We people of the earth have a solid foundation with this ancient traditional instruction.

345
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:21,230
And our solid foundation here is worthy of great respect, and will not lose that.

346
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:31,060
Here, in what elders we have today

347
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,600
That is where the cause for respect is.

348
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:49,220
What is worthy of respect gives a solid foundation for the people of the earth.

349
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:55,030
And they know the one that gives them their solid foundation.

350
00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:02,960
Since this ancient thing that’s come from long ago is our solid foundation

351
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:11,270
And since it’s our support for life, we who are healthy are standing here.

352
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:17,550
And this is what we’re like:

353
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:26,150
We value a person’s name, their Yup’ik name.

354
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:35,380
We also value speaking in Yup’ik because we’re Yup’ik.

355
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:44,370
That especially, calling each other by our [Yup’ik] names, is a cause for great thanks.

356
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:51,760
Then, we Yupiit also know this:

357
00:50:52,320 --> 00:51:04,200
Welcoming each other, and socializing with each other with this right way of socializing.

358
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:14,430
Our behavior like this among ourselves is very important.

359
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:22,500
And its need to be respected is always like that, and never loses it.

360
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,620
People back then would look at the snow.

361
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:54,820
When there’s a lot of snow, and the ice, when there’s a lot of ice

362
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:03,210
When there’s ice between layers of snow, when it’s been repeatedly warming up

363
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:11,240
When there’s a lot of snow, and a lot of snow upriver from us, there’s a lot of melt off. They’d say there’d be a lot of melt off.

364
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:18,180
Did you see a snowier time when there was a lot of snow?

365
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:23,200
There used to be a lot of snow back when we were small. There used to be a lot of snow here.

366
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:32,340
And the buildings down there, the mission house was the only tall one, and it would reach the roof going down.

367
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,700
We’d climb up there and slide.

368
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,800
And we’d shovel the doors of the porches like this into a den.

369
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:47,150
How, with February ending now, how would they prepare to go to spring camp back then?

370
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:51,670
When they were going to go to spring camp, they’d start preparing in April.

371
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:56,050
And they’d prepare their food supplies for the spring.

372
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,750
They’d go set up their tents, and...

373
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,250
Watch, I’ll slip into English.

374
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:12,350
And, you know, they’d bring their boats, and their open canoes.

375
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:16,800
They’d bring things they’d need to use in the spring camps.

376
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:25,360
Then when the middle of April passed, we’d move.

377
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:31,990
We’d arrive to our settlements. It was very good and pleasant.

378
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,940
Then these days, they also say this:

379
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:11,000
They said a woman with femal children, watch, that woman will watch her mother in the home.

380
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:18,880
Then they said that woman, her child, will be able to replicate her chores, what she does.

381
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,850
These are true.

382
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:28,870
And now, I have nine children, five girls, four boys.

383
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:38,240
And these five girls are all different. You know, they’re different.

384
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:45,000
And I love all of them very much.

385
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:50,880
Then when I started making things, and when I started sewing

386
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,370
And these grew up, my daughters started living on their own

387
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:01,220
I’d make them things, and sew things for them.

388
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:10,560
I sometimes go in their homes, and what I sewed is on the floor. I would feel unhappy.

389
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:16,260
Apparently, they’d leave leave on the floor what was supposed to be kept well.

390
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,250
I’d go into one of my daughter’s, [and it’s] neat.

391
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:25,960
Oh my, what I made would be treated with love.

392
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:36,860
Then when I do that, these among my children of five girls, two of them, I won’t say their names

393
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:44,120
They’re neat from what I’ve seen, what they call neat in English.

394
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,380
They’re good.

395
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,730
They’re all good.

396
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:58,970
Then I realized this: they take great care of the clothes I sewed.

397
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:07,640
Because the other takes especially good care of them, since we see them when we go into her house

398
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:21,850
In the summer, the clothes I sewed, parkas, skin boots, furs, fur clothes, I never see them in her house in the summer, nothing.

399
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:25,040
She put[s] them away.

400
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,350
You know, she puts them away.

401
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:37,780
I know that in the West, furs have appropriate places to be.

402
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:45,140
It’s not hot, it’s not cold, maybe meduim, and the fur is good.

403
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:56,090
You see, when these skin clothes hang for years and years, they become unusable [?from wearing out].

404
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:01,300
And when I take this parka, it rips. [?It wears out].

405
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:30,500
They said that if I see one of my peers in misfortune as I travel in the wilderness

406
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,140
I should help him with whatever I have.

407
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,670
That’s how we were instructed.

408
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:44,200
Or if he has no bullets, or is without food, I should give him some of what food I have.

409
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,030
They’d also tell us this:

410
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:57,020
They said that someday, if we lack something one day

411
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:01,910
When we lack something, we will not be [?robust].

412
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:08,240
Theys ay having an empty stomach is not enjoyable.

413
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:22,520
They say that one trait among every person is that the greatest suffering is suffering an empty stomach.

414
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:27,670
We become weak, and [?without vigor].

415
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:40,860
Also, if that person does not keep food, or throws food away though it’s edible

416
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:47,500
When it comes into his mind, when he regrets what he forsook, how unfortunate.

417
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:52,450
"I should’ve eaten that instead of throwing it away."

418
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:56,670
They said that’s what it’s like.

419
00:58:56,670 --> 00:59:04,390
They say he begins to covet everything in his mind in his hunger like this.

420
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:12,610
This is the important wisdom that we pass down.

421
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:20,750
Also, in the winter like this during the cold season

422
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:28,090
Since we especially struggle when we hunt

423
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,830
They told us not to travel without anything.

424
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:39,500
They told us not to travel without a shovel and an ice pick.

425
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:47,740
We should also know the names of these rivers.

426
00:59:48,320 --> 01:00:01,450
They said that one person, you see, during a famine may stand around a place with a lot of fish if he doesn’t know its name.

427
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:13,240
The people back then would name all of the subsistence areas in the wilderness

428
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:17,350
The place with various edible food.

429
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:26,690
They said that if a person doesn’t know that river’s name, he doesn’t know that it has fish though it’s indicated.

430
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:37,350
That’s why we’re told that we should know the names of things on land, rivers, and lakes

431
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:40,770
The places to hunt, to subsist.

432
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:45,160
