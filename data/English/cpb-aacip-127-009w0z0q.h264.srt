1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
…he didn’t refer to it as one.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,000
It seemed like a hypocrite.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And some say this:

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,500
They will only believe a person speaking in English.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,000
They will not believe him even if he speaks Yup’ik.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,000
They say that their minds are no longer true.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Because our language is a gift from God, it is our strength.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,500
We can do anything though it seems impossible through our
ability to speak Yup’ik.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It’s in the way.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Ready? Is the tape rolling this time?

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay. Our ancestors used to say that was the most important.

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
And some said this:

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:25,500
“If you forget how to speak Yup’ik,
you will also forget the words of wisdom and the teachings.

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,000
“Who will you be if you become like that?”

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,000
Now, let’s get into this now.

16
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:45,900
The ancient instruction, one of the most important of Yup’ik instructions

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Is revering the land, revering everything no matter what it is.

18
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,000
Please talk about what that instruction is.

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:06,000
Please also talk about what you have seen
as you have lived up to this day.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes, is it time to start? Okay.

21
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,000
Do I say my name first?

22
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
My name is Joshua Phillip.

23
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:26,000
I was born… I am Maqista in Yup’ik; Maqista is my nickname.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I was born on January 1, 1912.

25
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,000
I am now 79 years old.

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,000
What I have seen, watched, and understood

27
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,000
I am going to tell youpl about what I personally understand,
not anyone else.

28
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Our ancestors apparently had this piece of wisdom:

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,500
Even if you see your fellow human for the first time, welcome him well

30
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,000
And love him as much as yourself.

31
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,000
And yet they had never received or seen this Bible.

32
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,000
And they had never seen even one Caucasian.

33
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,000
And they wore clothes that were all fur.

34
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Yet here is their traditional wisdom:

35
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,000
You must love your peer as much as yourself.

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,000
Now, I finally understand

37
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:52,500
In our belief, they say that Jese brought two [commandments] down
saying this:

38
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,000
The commandments were given through Moses

39
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:03,500
But compassion and truthfulness [came] from Jesus Christ.

40
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:12,000
And then, our ancestors’ unknowing traditional wisdom:

41
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,500
You must love your peer as much as yourself.

42
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,500
Our ancestors instructed that most importantly, saying this:

43
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,000
“Eventually, they will start saying that person cannot be fixed,

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,900
“That he is bad, mischievous.”

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Here is their traditional wisdom:

46
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,000
“Do not, under any circumstances, go along with what they’re saying.

47
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
“And do not criticize the one they criticize.

48
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:52,000
“And if you see him, chat with him so he’ll be happy,
and feed him if he’s hungry.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,500
“And if his clothes are tattered, if you have any to spare,
look at him and give him one of your clothes.”

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That is treating others well, showing love

51
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,000
The most important instruction from our ancient ancestors.

52
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,000
And then, I read this in the Bible:

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It’s said that the Old Testament and New Testament are unified
into one word saying this:

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
“You must love your peer as much as yourself.”

55
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,500
That’s what it is. We have no other salvation.

56
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,000
They say that we have no other salvation under this entire world

57
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,000
Except for compassion and truthfulness.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,500
This compassion and truthfulness were the most important
instructions of our ancestors.

59
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,000
This is what truthfulness is like:

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That we should not speak lies, nor give false accounts,

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,500
But only speak the truth.

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,500
It is the companion of compassion, related to it.

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,500
There were two that Jesus brought down, compassion and truthfulness

64
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Long before our ancestors heard it, they scattered that compassion
among their descendants.

65
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,000
Love is the greatest.

66
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,000
They also say that the Bible says something else:

67
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,500
We have no other salvation except through compassion
and truthfulness.

68
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,500
Those2 are the greatest pieces2 of traditional wisdom for us.

69
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Has this been according [to what was planned]?

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It is.

71
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:02,500
I am now going to talk about how we traveled this spring.

72
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,500
In the spring nearing summer, I had this idea:

73
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,000
Well now, to one of my past hunting grounds inland

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,500
When summer sets, I should go see one of the places I used to
walk about with a canoe that has a small motor.

75
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,000
And then when summer set and there was no more ice

76
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:36,000
We portaged through the route upriver from Tuluksak
to the headwaters of Elaayuk.

77
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,000
That’s the first time we went downriver through there.

78
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,000
When we came upon tussocks of grass as we went downriver, I would stop and look around from a vantage point.

79
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,000
When I was climbing to vantage points,
I would come across empty pop containers.

80
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,500
And as I traveled with my motor on the river

81
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:06,000
I would see plastic stuffed in tree branches.

82
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,000
It would be stuck there.

83
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I saw a lot of those.

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,500
I didn’t think anything when I first found out.

85
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,000
Eventually, we went far downriver over there

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Pity, because everything had old pop containers

87
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,500
I had a though because there were old pop containers

88
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,500
My goodness, look at our children.

89
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,000
It’s way too polluted, not like our ancestors.

90
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
These are the most prevalent:

91
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Old pop containers, plastic, and where the pick berries, diapers too.

92
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,500
And in their camp sites, there’s nothing but debris
where those aren’t put away.

93
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:09,000
Back in our ancestors’ time, they made the land pristine.

94
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
There was no pollution, none of those.

95
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,000
There were no old pop containers, metal, plastic, or diapers.

96
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,500
And as they were there, old drift nets too.

97
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,500
What [nets] that were set all winter is here to the mouth
of the Kuskokwim and even the Akula region inland.

98
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It’s polluted. It’s polluting the fish, and the land here is polluted.

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,900
And yesterday, when Matthew Beans was telling a story,
he said this:

100
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,900
When he goes to villages on planes

101
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He sees a lot of those plastic and paper products
when he gets close to villages

102
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,500
The things that the wind carried like a storm.

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,500
When I saw those so much there, I had this thought last spring:

104
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,900
I will tell them in the church.

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Or even outside of the church, I will point those out to them.

106
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,900
Our ancestors were pristine.

107
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,500
They revered their land here and alwauys kept it cleaned up.

108
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,000
And in their time, their water, the Kuskokwim

109
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:52,000
Even outside of the Kuskokwim, they revered the creeks too,
kept them from being polluted.

110
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Neither did they pollute the land where they subsisted.

111
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Our ancestors always kept it cleaned up saying this:

112
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
The Spirit of the Universe is watching us.

113
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,000
They said that the Spirit of the Universe is watching us
without leaving anyone out.

114
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,000
The intelligent read in the Bible, and I read too

115
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It says this in Psalms 24:

116
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,000
God owns the land and everything on it.

117
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,500
He also owns all that live there.

118
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Pity, we who are polluting our land these days
who are called [Christian] believers.

119
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:50,000
Will we [truly] be believers polluting our air and land?

120
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,500
I pondered and realized

121
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,500
That we believers will evidently not have air like that.

122
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Our village where we stay in the winter,
and our subsisting grounds in the wilderness

123
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We must keep them like a cleaned up house

124
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,500
Our air, hunting grounds, fishing grounds, and our Kuskokwim.

125
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:28,000
And these days as I travel on the Kuskokwim,
I would see a pop container drifting along here.

126
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,900
And yet it’s where we subsist and commercial fish.

127
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,500
Gross, what will happen when it rusts?

128
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,500
You see, our ancestors back then said this:

129
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,000
These fish are easily repulsed.

130
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,500
They said that if these river has anything bad in it

131
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,500
The fish will not go in it because water keeps them alive.

132
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,500
Because they know that if they go in it,
they will die before they reach its headwaters.

133
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Since a long time ago, they say that they can’t go in polluted water.

134
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:18,000
Since our ancestors’ time back then, taking care of the land
and taking care of the water

135
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:26,500
They have admonishments on those from what true things
they have learned over millions of millions [of] years.

136
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,500
Their admonishments only concern what is true

137
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,500
What they understand, what they have seen with their very own eyes.

138
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,400
Because it’s like that now, we must take care these days.

139
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Things are depleting, and fish are depleting this days

140
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,000
Because we are not respecting our water and land, polluting them.

141
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,000
Can’t we incinerate these [our garbage]?

142
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:08,500
Or, we must leave them buried in the land
to keep our land cleaned up.

143
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Nallunrituci enengqellriani assilrianek
caranglliisqumanritarci enesi.

144
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Your land, air, and hunting grounds are more important.

145
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,500
You must watch over it more than your own homes where you sleep.

146
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,500
Keep it cleaned up.

147
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,500
Because our land is polluted these days, God cannot bless it.

148
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He’s reducing things, reducing the fish

149
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And it seems he’s reducing these cloudberries.

150
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,500
He cannot bless a polluted land.

151
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Let us not put it to another person or Caucasian

152
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,500
Except to us who live in the land.

153
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,500
Those things that must be cleaned and watched over

154
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,000
We should only put them on ourselves, not pass them to another person.

155
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
As we are not careful of ourselves

156
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,000
And as we do not instruct our young people to
respectfully use that [land]

157
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,000
We’re making it become like that because we hide
[the knowledge] from our young people.

158
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,000
Now, let us instruct them from here on out

159
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,900
To share the land and keep it pristine.

160
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,400
It’s very clear that when our land becomes pristine

161
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,000
God will bless it like [the time of] our ancestors

162
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:09,000
Making things abundant, making nothing scarce,
making everything we use on this land available.

163
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:16,000
They can do that for birds, small animals, caribou, and minks.

164
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,000
When they tell stories of our ancestors’ time back then

165
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:30,500
They said that their traps would be full, and couldn’t catch any more
minks when they couldn’t swallow.

166
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,500
Things were abundant back then.

167
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:41,500
Because the land was cleaned up and pristine like this
God blessed it like that.

168
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
There were instructions for every kind of meat

169
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,500
To bury the leftovers we won’t use in pits and leave them.

170
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:00,000
And if we see a caribou bone or the bone of another small animal
in the wilderness

171
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:07,000
If there is no lake near it, to bury it in land and leave it.

172
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,500
If there is a lake nearbly, go throw its bone in there.

173
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,500
That’s what our ancestors instructed.

174
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,500
They asked to the keep the land that they saw here pristine.

175
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,500
When I returned from my travels last spring,
that’s what I wanted to say.

176
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Our caretaker, the creator and owner of the land cannot bless it
when it’s polluted like this.

177
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,500
There you have it.

178
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And then, you see, it’s apprently very expensive to clean this land up.

179
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:07,000
These days, you see, I saw people getting paid to clean up the land
over there.

180
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,000
And yet, they’re called cleaners.

181
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,000
Now, they only have their eyes on money.

182
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,500
Back then, however, our ancestors didn’t watch for [money].

183
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Our ancestors back then only looked out for living long lives.

184
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
They were like this:

185
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:47,000
In their lands, there was no grass growing,
[because] they cleaned up their land after the grass grew.

186
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,500
And then in the winter, they would shovel the trails.

187
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Our ancestors also shoveled trails to get water.

188
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,000
Because they were like that, their land was blessed.

189
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And those who cleaned up would say this:

190
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:21,000
“Enjoy [cleaning] dust, enjoy cleaning up in your life
without thinking of money.

191
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,900
“Cleaning up is expensive.

192
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:33,000
“So you may have food in your future, on everything you look back on.

193
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:42,500
“And then as your future always has food like that,
you will live long on the earth.”

194
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,500
That is the promise of cleaning up.

195
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It’s no wonder in my earliest memories back then

196
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,500
I would see old women and old men supporting themselves
with their knees as they walked.

197
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
They couldn’t stretch [their legs] because they were
such old men and old women.

198
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It turned out that our ancestors, including the women,
would live long because they always cleaned up their land.

199
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,500
And they started walking supporting themselves with their knees.

200
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That is the reward for those who clean up.

201
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,900
And then they would tell these stories:

202
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,500
This great hunter was lacking unlike his peers.

203
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,000
And his name was Picuilnguq [Bad Hunter].
And even when he tried, he wouldn’t catch anything.

204
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,000
They say that those people who envy these good hunters

205
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
They become cleaners in villages though no one orders them to.

206
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,500
They apparently become cleaners in villages
because they’re ashamed that they can’t catch anything.

207
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
When that happens and they [clean up] like that

208
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The ones who are called great hunters, good hunters

209
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:28,000
A person who cleans up like that becomes a better hunter than them.

210
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:37,000
This is what it is: God [sees] that person cleaning up his land

211
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,500
And repays him with what he wants out of gratitude.

212
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,500
That’s their reward. As long as he lives, he will be like that,
living without lacking anything.

213
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,500
Cleaning up the land has these great rewards.

214
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,500
We should not ignore it.

215
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
They also used to tell us this:

216
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:11,000
You will come across a log on its side on traveling paths
completely blocking traveling paths.

217
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,500
Do not pass that log laying on the traveling path.

218
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,500
Take it and throw it over where travelers do not go.

219
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,500
It has this result: as you travel on this land

220
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:35,500
You may travel without severe misfortune on this land.

221
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,000
That’s its promise.
You may travel without severe misfortune on this land.

222
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,500
That’s its promise.

223
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And these days, they will be like this:

224
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,500
Even our fish camps, clean up even our fish camps

225
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And wash the fish off of fish cutting areas or other places.

226
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:11,000
Do not pollute the fish, our fish cutting areas, or fishing grounds
with metals or paper products.

227
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
We must make incinerators and burn paper products.

228
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,500
We should also bury our metal [trash] into pits,
not throw them into the water of our Kuskokwim River

229
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Because we will have no more fish on the Kuskokwim when that rusts.

230
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,000
That is the most important thing we must watch over.

231
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We are called [Christian] believers these days.

232
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
If we are believers, we would always clean up land that is not ours.

233
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,000
We should properly use what God has lent to us.

234
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,500
But we do not understand this days.

235
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It’s probably because the young people speak English.

236
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,000
It’s like that depriving us of everything.

237
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And the pollution is depriving food of our hunting and gathering grounds.

238
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:25,000
That ability to speak English will not save us, only our belief

239
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,000
And cleaning up our land out of respect through faith.

240
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:37,800
You see, this is how our ancestors back then treated this land
that they used:

241
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,000
They would respect even the wilderness as their own houses.

242
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:53,000
And then, they also respecting the Kuskokwim, their water where they
subsist, and the places where they trap blackfish.

243
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:03,500
And they would never let them freeze or spoil [what they had caught] saying that the fish traps would not get fish anymore.

244
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:14,000
Because there is a lot of that now, and drift nets spoiling [catch],
the fish are depleting.

245
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:20,500
We must understand that God has cursed us through that.

246
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:30,000
We have worsening shortages of things, shortages of fish,
the food that we are given.

247
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:37,000
My goodness, let all of us elders be in accordance

248
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:44,500
Let us instruct our descendants to take care of this land
to keep it pristine.

249
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:52,500
When it is pristine again, God will certainly bless it our of gratitude.

250
00:25:53,500 --> 00:26:05,000
When he blesses it, the things we eat, sell, and gather
will increase all in the same way.

251
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:15,500
I am thankful when I hear people sometimes talking
[about traditional wisdom] on the radio.

252
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,000
This important thought that I had last spring

253
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I am speaking to all of you who are listening about
what I wanted to say about the things I saw with my own eyes.

254
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,900
We must raise up our young people to be like that.

255
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:45,500
Now, I have been like that with my children for a long time,
telling them to clean up regularly.

256
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:53,500
And I have them watch me as I clean up in front of them,
and have them watch me clean up our fish camp.

257
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,500
I also tell them not to throw these empty motor oil cans into the water.

258
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I wrap them in plastic and throw them into holes that I dug in the ground.

259
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:17,500
I don’t only tell them, but instruct my children on what I do
by having them watch me.

260
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,500
We fathers and mothers must do that

261
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,900
To respect our land like our ancestors since the beginning

262
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,500
And to watch over, use it well, and keep it pristine.

263
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,000
My, we will do well if we do that.

264
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,000
Will God not thank us in the last day?

265
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,000
Will he not tell us that we cleaned up his land?

266
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:02,500
Because he owns it, he certainly made those who cleaned up
into great hunters a long time ago.

267
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,900
Begin with that.

268
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,900
There is a lot to this.

269
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,000
I’ve said what I wanted to say when I arrived.

270
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:23,000
I also talk about how to clean up both the land and water in churches.

271
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,000
Respect them.

272
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
There is so much to this.

273
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:41,800
Let us all not fail to raise up our young people
and tell them to keep this [earth] pristine.

274
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,400
I say this to my children:

275
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Even if you had slept there for the night, always leave it cleaned up.

276
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We must tell them that.

277
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,900
These days, I also see used diapers

278
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The used diapers of their loved ones are [scattered], a lot.

279
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,000
Are those not a cause for ingratitude in God’s eyes?

280
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:17,700
It’s time for us to take care of our land in accordance like our ancestors,
keep it cleaned up.

281
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Thank you. I thank you if you’re listening.

282
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:31,500
I will also try to do that as I’ve said as much as I can.

283
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Thank you, I have told you what I think is important.

284
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Cleaning up apparently also makes for a long life.

285
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That [subject] is over now.

286
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:56,000
Let’s2 move to another [topic] if you can move to another.

287
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,500
Okay.

288
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,500
Should I go this way?

289
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,300
Ready?

290
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,000
Now, I’m going to ask you something else.

291
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,000
[S]he said you’re doing this too much.

292
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,500
Please try to stay still without moving too much.

293
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,400
Sometime recently, one of your daughters

294
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:35,000
When we interviewed one of your daughters, [s]he asked her now she was raised.

295
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,000
And then she said that this is what she thought:

296
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:50,000
When one of their peers misbehaved, your late wife
would gather them all and admonish them.

297
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
How is admonishing like that now

298
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,000
You know, we’ve started hear know that people only discriminate
against someone who misbehaves.

299
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,500
And some who are families do not love him too much

300
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:14,000
Separating him because he’s mischievous, disobedient,
an alcoholic, or something else.

301
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:25,000
How did you and your late wife raise your children?

302
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
What is raising a child like?

303
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,500
Child rearing is also part of the traditional wisdom
from our ancestors back then.

304
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:51,000
My father raised me back then, and probably when I needed it,
he would instruct me without regard [for my feelings].

305
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Or, he would also gather my family and my older sisters
to instruct us on how we should live.

306
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,000
And then they would say this to us:

307
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:11,000
“Do not despise your peers in life. Instead, humble yourselves
before them in life.”

308
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:24,000
Adhering to that ancient piece of wisdom, our pride should be
as much as what they tread upon in our live.

309
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:29,000
Let us be as humble as the grass they tread upon.

310
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And then they asked me when I took a wife and had children

311
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:46,000
When I had children my father said to me, “You are now a father.

312
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,500
“You are now an instructor for your child who is born.

313
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,700
“I will not teach or instruct you.

314
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:06,000
“I have already instructed you on what you should
pass on to your child whom you love.

315
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,500
“I have also talked to you about what has not originated from me.

316
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,000
“I’ve passed on my father’s traditional wisdom onto you.

317
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:24,500
“You are doing that, but I will watch you.
I will admonish you when you warrant it.”

318
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,500
And then this: “Children are different.”

319
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Now I have nine children.

320
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:48,000
Five are male, and three are female.

321
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:58,400
These people are different. One of them tends to be mischievous
and disregards [instruction or wisdom].

322
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,000
They’re evidently different as our ancestors back then have said.

323
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,000
They say that descendants are different even when they shared a womb.

324
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,000
That’s what they say.

325
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:19,500
But even though they are different, compassion is the most important
piece of traditional wisdom.

326
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
They also used to tell us this:

327
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:30,500
“If one of your family members is mischievous and disobedient

328
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:37,500
“Because youpl, his siblings, try not to be like that in life

329
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,400
“Youpl, his siblings, must gather and admonish him.

330
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:53,500
“Do not scold or criticize him, but treat him well with love.

331
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,000
“And do not speak harshly, but with tenderhearted love.

332
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
“Because yourpl sibling is like that, youpl must admonish him with love.”

333
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And then if you take in a son-in-law, it’s an ancient custom

334
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:30,500
If you take in a son-in-law, love him more than your own children.

335
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:42,000
No matter what he does, do not react violently to him, but speak to him
and instruct him with tenderhearted love.

336
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,000
My son-in-law is [mischievous] like that,
and he abuses this alcohol

337
00:35:51,500 --> 00:36:00,000
But I have never spoken harshly to him to this day
according to what I was instructed.

338
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:12,000
Concerning what little instruction I gave [him], I talked about that wisdom
with tenderhearted love for my own son-in-law.

339
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:19,000
That’s why my son-in-law cannot leave me alone today.

340
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,000
And if he seens that I need something, he will help me.

341
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,500
That’s what trying to treat everyone with love is like.

342
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,800
We must be like that.

343
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And then, I think I just talked about it first

344
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:46,500
That I should not join others in criticizing mischievous people.

345
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
That is traditional wisdom from our ancestors.

346
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,200
They say that a [Christian] believer…

347
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:07,000
Back then, they didn’t talk about believers, but obedient people.

348
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,500
Instead, they called believers obedient.

349
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,000
These days, they call them [Christian] believers.

350
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,900
Back then, however, our ancestors called them qanrucunalriit

351
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:34,500
They referred to someone who did not do whatever he wanted
but adhered to his instructions as obedient.

352
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:43,000
These days, however, we are called believers,
call that obedient person [a believer].

353
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:57,500
They told us to be like that so that we would stand [alive] for a long time
and that we would be given long-lasting strength.

354
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
These are evidently instructions saying this,

355
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
After they instructed us, they would say this:

356
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:15,000
“A person instruction whom he loves so that [s]he will live well.”

357
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:32,500
Jesus further explained those with his words
saying this to his disciples in John 6 verse 63.

358
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,000
John 6 verse 63, Jesus explicitly said,

359
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,000
“My words to you are breath and life.”

360
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Here is wisdom from back before our ancestors before there was a Bible:

361
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:06,000
If you, a great hunter, come upon misfortune that you cannot survive

362
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:14,800
If you flustered and do not remember the traditional wisdom you heard

363
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:20,500
If you do not remember them, you will die by your own fault.

364
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Yet even if you come upon misfortune, if you remember traditional wisdom

365
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:38,000
The wisdom you remember will give you strength and save you from that.

366
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:45,500
That is apparently how these instructions are breath and life.

367
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,500
We must adhere to them.

368
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,000
They would also tell us this:

369
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:00,000
“Quit being so noisy. Do not act so mindlessly.”

370
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,000
They would also tell us that when we made too much noise in our homes.

371
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:11,500
Behold the precious young people these days

372
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:20,000
They even fill a huge plane and bring them to other villages
to make a lot of noise.

373
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,000
They say they’re bringing them to play basketball.

374
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Yet there was this instruction among our ancestors:

375
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:39,000
If you bring this growing boy do other villages,
he will be mischievous.

376
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,500
And even in other villages where he has never been or seen

377
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,500
He will be able to be noisy there without shame when he arrives.

378
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,900
They say that’s what one who was brought to outside villages
when he was growing up has always been like.

379
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,000
Because those ancestors have seen that

380
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:09,900
They tell people not to bring a growing child to others’ houses
in their villages.

381
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,000
Or, they tell people not to bring them to other villages.

382
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,000
That is the instruction of our ancestors back then.

383
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,500
They say that if we want a mindful child, we will adhere to that.

384
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:36,000
We would not bring our children whom we love to other’s houses,
and we won’t bring them to other [villages].

385
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,500
They say that some would say this:

386
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
“That person is sensible, wise, and articulate.”

387
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,500
They say that’s what people who were not taken to other places
when they were growing are like.

388
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,000
Those are true pieces of wisdom from our ancestors.

389
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:07,500
Our ancestors back then teach things, true things, that they have seen.

390
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
There you have it.

391
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And then they said that even if we are short on something as we live,
we should never take a person’s things or their traps.

392
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,000
They told us not to steal, or to take another person’s catches.

393
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
They said this:

394
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:46,000
“If you take that mink or fox

395
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:55,000
“Your caretaker, God, the Spirit of the Universe,
will let what was prepared to be yours be taken.

396
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,500
“If you take that, you will take one

397
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:13,000
“But God will exchange what was supposed to be yours to the
one who owns the trap that you’ve taken.

398
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,000
“You will only catch one.

399
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
“You will transfer what was to be yours to that person.”

400
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,000
That’s another piece of traditional wisdom.

401
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,500
And then some would also say

402
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,700
The legs of some who steal too much get crippled

403
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,500
Or their arms get crippled.

404
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:49,400
They say that shamans used to do that with their tools
to the people who did that a long time ago.

405
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:56,800
They crippled their legs, and crippled their arms to make them suffer.

406
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Those shamans made them like that with their tools
because they were unhappy with them.

407
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:10,000
That’s why they especially warned us against taking a person’s things.

408
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,000
Behold the people these days.

409
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:21,000
Because we do not teach that starting from when they’re growing

410
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
They run off with boats, and they steal a person’s boat motor

411
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And they would steal a person’s entire drift net from his boat.

412
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:45,000
They’ve probably become like that because they don’t hear about
the consequences of stealing and how dangerous it is

413
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:51,000
Because we don’t admonish them against doing that.

414
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,500
And yet our ancestors strongly warned against it.

415
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
But they also had this traditional wisdom:

416
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Let us try to make every one of our fellow people happy in our lives.

417
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:15,000
They said to look at these people who have always had things,
and they gather what they need.

418
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,000
They say that they’re like that through people’s gratitude.

419
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,000
They say that gratitude is good.

420
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And then I read this in the Bible:

421
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Giving is more of a cause for gratitude than receiving.

422
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:43,000
It’s a cause for gratitude to receive a gift

423
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,500
But the Bible says that giving is more important

424
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Because it says this: “Giving is more of a
cause for gratitude than receiving.”

425
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:08,500
That’s why our ancestors told us to help our fellow people
as a form of love if we have anything to spare.

426
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
They say that out a person’s gratitude

427
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,400
It’s like a person’s body is given strength.

428
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,300
God probably does that.

429
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:29,000
They also told us to serve others in our lives.

430
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:35,500
And they say this: we will not deteriorate from our soles.

431
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
They say that.

432
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:47,000
They say that as we serve, we will become stronger,
and sicknesses will not touch us.

433
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:54,000
Even if others are sick during an epidemic, they will not touch us.

434
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
That’s is the promise of servitude.

435
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:03,000
A person will stand [alive] for a long time with any afflictions.

436
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,000
This also concerns servitude: people are thankful.

437
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:17,000
Or, if [s]he gets water or chops wood, an old woman or old man
can be thankful for that.

438
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,400
They say that his gratitude will uplift that person.

439
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Those are our ancestors’ traditional wisdom.

440
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I’ve said a lot by now.

441
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:36,000
Okay. Well, thank you for coming.

442
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,800
This is all for now.

443
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:51,000
But someday if we are able, we should gather and talk
if you have something else in mind as you go along.

444
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,400
Thank you.

445
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:59,000
I will come if by chance I think of something that must addressed.

446
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:07,000
Thank you. May our caretaker bless what you have heard.
