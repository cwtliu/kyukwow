1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,820
Because they’re forgetting your pratices, and our grandfathers’ traditions back then.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,440
This is precious, our culture should be [?].

3
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:17,945
It’s very precious.

4
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:28,685
For that reason, he and I especially push for you to look at and teach lessons to these young people here.

5
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:34,395
And in village like this, anywhere

6
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,270
Do not reject our Yup’ik culture, but share it with these young people.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:48,400
If they watch us practicing it without rejecting it, they will follow suit.

8
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:55,065
We must keep them from leaning toward these Western ways.

9
00:00:55,235 --> 00:01:01,745
It is upon us to continue the Yup’ik culture here.

10
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:07,385
If we don’t want to practice it, these young people here won’t want to practice it.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:17,820
Only if they watch you, if they watch us put our Yup’ik culture first, without rejecting it, and being enthused about it, only then will they follow suit.

12
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:26,220
We don’t need to say to them, "Hey you, go to the Yup’ik dancing. Hey you, go listen to them singing."

13
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:33,880
Let’s stop saying that. If we stand and go sit of our own accord, they will follow suit.

14
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:37,215
That’s what I have to say.

15
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:41,995
I just related to the community here and the rest of the group

16
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:55,415
Is the Coastal Yukon Villages Association have directed Mr. Troll and I to be a project director to have an activity like this during this year.

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:07,650
We were glad to be the directors and getting the support from the donors to have this activity available and made tonight.

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:20,490
One of most things that we’re glad about, we wanted to preserve our culture, both the language and the culture itself.

19
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:33,800
We want to show these kids, the young ones especially, through our actions we can show them that we really mean to preserve our language and culture.

20
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,380
If we do it ourselves, they will follow us.

21
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:44,030
We don’t have to tell them to go to the Eskimo dance, to go sing the song that the people are singing.

22
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:51,030
If we as elders and young men do it, they will follow us. We don’t have to tell them. We don’t have to push them.

23
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:58,195
If we ourselves show interest in preserving our culture, they will follow us too. Thank you.

24
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,460
Stebbins, Mr. Francis Rivers.

25
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:11,125
Oh, Benny

26
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,190
Benny Ketcha.

27
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,550
You see me here. I came from Stebbins.

28
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:30,520
Now, some of you older ones seem to recognize me.

29
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:39,170
Now, I am thankful that we see each other.

30
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:45,705
I am very thankful. And the ancient things are true.

31
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:54,710
Long ago when I was a boy, I heard a lot of traditional wisdom.

32
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:58,955
I started back when I was small, and I lost my father.

33
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:05,105
My father had already been dead for a while. My father died before I was active.

34
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:08,155
My mother raised me instead.

35
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,460
Also, our descendants here now

36
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:21,515
These old ways

37
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,520
I want them to learn their ancient traditional wisdom.

38
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:41,795
I don’t want these ancient pieces of wisdom to disappear

39
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,700
Because when we’re gone, it will disappear.

40
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:56,650
Now, the people that have been speaking this evening have made me feel thankful.

41
00:04:56,955 --> 00:05:02,295
Now, all of us villages have started enjoying this.

42
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,650
When we see each other, it makes me feel very thankful.

43
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:14,980
When we’re gone, these descendats of ours will probably remember that.

44
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:21,885
It seems that our mindful descendants will not let them disappear.

45
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,400
Some of us probably won’t live very long either.

46
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:41,924
I hope that our descendants, with their new ways that bring desctruction

47
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:49,137
I hope they start going after the old traditions.

48
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:57,944
I cannot speak too much English either.

49
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:04,063
I can’t speak too much English.

50
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:17,294
Now, I am very thankful that these people had us come

51
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:27,601
Mountain Village too, and looking at Toksook Bay, and looking at the place they call St. Mary’s.

52
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:35,358
It’s like we are close-knit now. I am very thankful for that.

53
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:42,483
I cannot speak too excessively either.

54
00:06:51,258 --> 00:07:00,133
He has echoed what has been said earlier by the other leaders that were up here talking.

55
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:12,939
Not just imagning seeing our relatives who are our, our relatives, looking at our relatives, having them see them

56
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:19,458
The people from Mountain Village brought them here through this to have us see them.

57
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:23,102
That is what I’m thankful for.

58
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:39,602
But now the things that our ancestors experienced like this always stays in my mind.

59
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:47,734
Our ancestors were tight knit with the people around them.

60
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:51,403
They were also very compassionate towards each other.

61
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:57,641
Let us do this:

62
00:07:57,773 --> 00:08:06,973
Let’s not abandon those wonder pieces of wisdom, the wisdom of the ones who spoke before me

63
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:13,492
Let’s not abandon them, whether here, or whether we go out.

64
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:18,405
We must hold them for the duration of our short lives.

65
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:26,124
Let’s hold on to them and not abandon them, and don’t abandon them even if we go back home.

66
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:35,681
Let us try to use them toward our children here out of love, not lose them.

67
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:49,381
Those elders spoke correct things to the young ones, telling us to be a compassionate community.

68
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:59,756
They also admonished our peers, they also admonished us against speaking accusations about what those around us wouldn’t do.

69
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:10,269
Also, if we come across something like this, one who does bad things

70
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:18,488
They said we should not look at him through that, but to look at him through his good characteristics.

71
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:29,326
Our ancestors here wanted their young people to do well like this.

72
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:37,382
Let us also try to practice those, our ancestors’ traditions.

73
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:51,038
Let us try to practice them with our children, and even if they’re not our children. Let’s try to practice them with these young people.

74
00:09:51,282 --> 00:10:00,632
I am thankful for this, that we were brought here to see each other.

75
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:12,018
It gives us great joy to do that, to see our relatives, our close friends, during that time

76
00:10:12,037 --> 00:10:21,112
Seeing our relatives, not just imagining them, but seeing them in person.

77
00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:32,918
This is also a [?good] thing to do: let us only rely on God for help.

78
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:41,369
Let us only rely on him for help, even if he doesn’t give us everything we want.

79
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:47,232
He will listen to us after not granting our request.

80
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:53,713
You see, he will eventually bring us what we want.

81
00:10:53,726 --> 00:11:04,676
Also, when we go back to our homes, those wonderful pieces of traditional wisdom from those who spoke first

82
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:13,745
Let us pass on those wondeful pieces of wisdom to our little children.

83
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:17,902
Though don’t understand us when we speak Cup’ik.

84
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:28,621
But though they do that, though they don’t understand, we must try to take care of our children.

85
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:32,459
Teach them to the point where they’re peaceful.

86
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:41,140
I am thankful to these who had us come for that.

87
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:58,116
...St. Mary’s, one of my jobs that I miss very dearly, is that I got to yell at the kids to be quiet. So you kids be quiet while I’m talking, alright?

88
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:04,635
I want all of you to know that this is only half of what this festival is about.

89
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:14,772
One of the important that we’re doing and that you’ve talked about tonight as elders, that it’s important to preserve your culture and pass it along to your children.

90
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:27,791
Well, these three days, you have an excellent opportunity, not only for dancing, but we have some artifacts and things that were collected by Sheldon Jackson 100 years ago from this area.

91
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,848
So it is very important, we want you elders to go up and see it.

92
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:40,298
If you know things about it, we want you to talk and talk, and tell your children about this.

93
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:44,149
These are things that you may remember from when you were kids.

94
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:52,024
The things you’re going to see up there are very, very interesting, and I think many of your children are not going to understand what they were for.

95
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,330
So it is very important for you to talk with them and see it.

96
00:12:56,349 --> 00:13:02,799
The exhibit will be open tomorrow at 9 o’clock, and will go until the potluck dinner at 3 o’clock.

97
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:06,118
Then it’ll be open from Sunday until we start dancing.

98
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:12,806
Now, I have a long list of thank-yous, but I’m going to do that tomorrow night and maybe the night after, so we can get right to dancing.

99
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:18,488
But one of the people I want to introduce and to at least acknowledge three, four people at this time.

100
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:28,682
One is the gentleman who’s sitting out back here in the corner. He looks like Kenny Rogers. That is Peter Corey. He is the curator of the Sheldon Jackson Museum in Sitka.

101
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:34,244
He has allowed all of these old things to come out here for you to see for the next three days.

102
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:42,363
When you go and see him tomorrow, if you know things, talk to him. Let him know things about the things that are there if you have information.

103
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:51,226
The other person I want to thank is Wassilie Evan. He went down to Sitka with me and helped select the artifacts that are there.

104
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:57,889
The other person is Wiliie Beans who’s kind of hiding back up there. But he also went down to Sitka to help pick...

105
00:13:57,908 --> 00:14:05,671
...expalin to the young people, the children here, about the significance of what you see if you know them.

106
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:13,796
We want to use you there to explain those handmade Yup’ik things.

107
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,833
He also wants to thank four people...

108
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:25,296
...you will see what they pointed to and that we brought. Please go see them tomorrow.

109
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:30,246
But we want to use you if you know their significance.

110
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:42,033
We’ve got the reporters from the following: Lower Yukon School District newsletter Joyce Copper, Mountain Village High School journalist...

111
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:47,009
 ́́́...movies, Mountain VIllage High School photograph, James Parker.

112
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:51,896
Alaska Maganize [?right here], Danny [?] Edward Beans.

113
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:57,777
Peter Corey, McKinney Rogers of the Sheldon Jackson Museum.

114
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,808
...having Eskimo dancing.

115
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,952
And for all you people that’s going to be using the bathrooms back there...

116
00:15:06,765 --> 00:15:17,690
And also, all you tobacco chewers and snuff chewers, use those number 10 cans that are provided. Don’t use those pop cans, they spill too easy.

117
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,596
And before you go out, pick up your cans and throw them in the trash can. I don’t want to have to pick up your spit.

118
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:25,934
...in here, please.

119
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:38,797
And also transportation person is in charge is Mr. Demitry George, to the airport and within the local community.

120
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:46,959
And for safety factor, see these exit signs just in case there’s a fire.

121
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:49,340
Please don’t panic.

122
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:56,746
There’s double doors back here to go out, there’s the door where you came in, and this one here.

123
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:01,509
Use the city telephone over there.

124
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,115
I don’t want to speak for too long.

125
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:11,015
They don’t need to be translated to Yup’ik. These children, our descendants, understand.

126
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:13,853
Let’s start dancing. We’re getting restless.

127
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:26,947
This evening, these villages, 12 villages, will sing two songs each.
