1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,040
Take $25 and send it.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,950
[?] first, this one doesn’t seem like an elder.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,070
Sometimes, they say to me...

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,850
Where’s your mom? What?

5
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:17,155
Where’s the payment?

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,260
Wait.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,890
Okay.

8
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:28,035
Now, how did your caretakers choose your husband?

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:38,360
My caretaker had me take a husband that I didn’t choose. You know, I didn’t pick my own husband.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,430
How did they choose?

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:50,962
They said the way they chose was their parents would speak to each other about their children.

12
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:58,800
They said their parents would choose their daughters’ husbands, their son’s wives.

13
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:09,738
When there were a lot of suitors, would they look at their characters?

14
00:01:09,757 --> 00:01:23,069
Yes, they said that because people are different, their parents would choose the husband they preferred for their daughters.

15
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,582
Did you say nothing, only obeyed?

16
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:46,295
Yes, they said that back then, the young people, boys and girls, wouldn’t play with each other.

17
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:56,177
They said that they didn’t play with each other and didn’t get into relationships. You know, they weren’t too forward. They were respectful.

18
00:01:56,346 --> 00:02:01,071
And they wouldn’t walk around holding hands like they do now.

19
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:11,352
How can you be a good wife, one with a husband?

20
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:13,059
How I can be a wife?

21
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:14,209
Stop.

22
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:17,897
How can you be a good wife?

23
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:29,966
They said that those who could be good wifes would respect and defer to their spouses, their husbands.

24
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:42,141
They also said that if a woman takes a husband even if he has an ugly face, she will treat her husband with respect and deference.

25
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:44,903
Not disparaging him

26
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:52,847
What else?

27
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:07,704
As just now, one who can be a good wife will treat her husband with deference.

28
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:16,160
And she doesn’t mess around without his knowledge, and obeys him out of respect.

29
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:26,529
Should she always prepare food for him?

30
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:27,560
Yes.

31
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:28,473
And before they go home?

32
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:38,242
They also said that when they were in the wilderness a long time ago, their wives would wait for their husbands, only eating when they arrived.

33
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:48,768
Can you tell us anything about the things women worked on a long time ago?

34
00:03:49,855 --> 00:04:00,480
They said that a long time ago, the women were not like how they are now.

35
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:08,874
And boys, they didn’t have boys, greatly respecting each other.

36
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:19,368
They also said that when they played, the girls were separate, and the boys played separately over there, not interacting with each other like this.

37
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:28,081
That’s why they said they didn’t get pregnant, and there were scarce any pregnant young people a long time ago.

38
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:34,988
How did that lack of proper social conduct seem to start?

39
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:44,450
Recent, it seems to me in my observation, that we started lacking proper social conduct when we start going to school.

40
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:52,413
When we went to school, I would be withdrawn when I went to school.

41
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,450
It was a place to conduct oneself properly.

42
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:59,694
The teachers would admonish us against being withdrawn.

43
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:03,544
Now, however, they have no more sense of proper social conduct.

44
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:11,094
How did those teachers try to stop you from being withdrawn?

45
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:18,838
When we used to go to school, they would tell us not to be withdrawn

46
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:26,470
Yet we would be withdrawn [by proper social conduct] a long time ago.

47
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,495
You see, they lack proper social conduct now.

48
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:35,432
It seems, in my opinion, that those who hold themselves with proper social conduct are good, respecting everything before them.

49
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:43,813
And when people went into houses, they said they would stay put out of respect. Only when a person told them to come in would they come in.

50
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:49,294
Those who hold themselves with proper social conduct are good in my opinion.

51
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,532
Those without proper social conduct, however, are not good.

52
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:58,501
But now, they all lack proper social conduct because they’ve started doing various things at school.

53
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:03,263
What kinds of various things would you do?

54
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:08,313
We, you see, when I went to school, we didn’t do various things.

55
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,963
When they first built a school in Nunapitchuk, I was small when I went to school.

56
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:15,626
There was scarcely any various things to do.

57
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:24,733
We didn’t do various thigns, didn’t play basketball, didn’t do anything, didn’ t cheerlead.

58
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:32,958
Now, you know, they have scant clothing, with no reservation about their legs, and they embrace. They have no reservations.

59
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:36,821
We didn’t know those back when we were small.

60
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:44,015
How did your mother, or your caretaker ["aulukutestevet"], how did your caretaker...

61
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:46,090
"Aulukestevet." [Your caretaker]

62
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:54,784
How did your caretaker [?raise] you to be a good wife?

63
00:06:55,103 --> 00:07:03,678
My caretaker did not instruct me on how to be a good wife like that

64
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:10,497
But when old women sometimes spoke to me

65
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:19,479
Because I didn’t know since I was an orphan, they would speak to me about how to be a good wife, and mother to my children.

66
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:21,285
I learned from them.

67
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:23,048
What did they teach you?

68
00:07:23,217 --> 00:07:33,892
They taught me that my spouse, that my spouse and I should be a peaceful couple.

69
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:44,211
Also, if I raise my children, they told me not to shout at them when they first wake up in the morning.

70
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:49,005
That is admonished against.

71
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:56,017
They say we shouldn’t shout at our children in the morning.

72
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:56,849
Why?

73
00:07:57,024 --> 00:08:03,436
Probably because it’s not good. I don’t know the exact meaning of it.

74
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:09,787
I want young people to hear what I’ve said.

75
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,800
They’ve started speaking mostly in English in their youth. And many young people probably don’t understand me.

76
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:22,919
Why do married couples get divorced?

77
00:08:25,394 --> 00:08:32,019
They say that being married is a big responsibility.

78
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:39,163
Being married is a big responsibility and should be treated with respect.

79
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:49,107
They said that disparaging one’s spouse is admonished against like this.

80
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:57,463
I [will not disparage] my husband, and my husband will not disparage me. He should not treat me with disrespect.

81
00:08:57,476 --> 00:09:05,864
We do disparage each other when we harshly say something bad. They say that’s how we disparage each other.

82
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:12,164
Then they said that one is the greatest way to disparage one’s spouse.

83
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:21,552
A man, or if a women fools around with men without her husband’s knowledge, if she lets a man fornicate with her

84
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:24,421
They say that’s the greatest disparagement.

85
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:31,740
Or if a man fornicates with another woman without his wife’s knowledge

86
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:34,153
They say he disparages his wife.

87
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:40,810
They say those are the greatest ways to disparage one’s spouse.

88
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:50,135
What can we young people focus on to, you know, stop doing that, to keep from doing that?

89
00:09:50,817 --> 00:10:01,542
If one wants to keep from doing those, they must listen to their ancient traditional wisdom.

90
00:10:01,873 --> 00:10:11,936
Even if you go to school where they do various things and you are smart, there probably won’t be anything written about how you can be a good wife.

91
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:16,073
Or, there is nothing written about how you can be a good husband.

92
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,042
Though a person is very smart, he will not learn in school.

93
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:30,818
But through these from our Yup’ik elders, and even though I am not an elder, I am instructing you now.

94
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:38,805
If you want to be good wives, respect your spouses.

95
00:10:38,824 --> 00:10:41,899
Or a man must respect his wife.

96
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:44,305
Without committing adultery.

97
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:54,787
One who wants to be a good wife or husband will not "love" others, but will be married to their spouse.

98
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:58,474
But now...

99
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:04,918
Did you ask about how to be a bad wife or husband?

100
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:14,412
If a person is a bad wife or husband, they will not respect their spouse

101
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:20,931
They said that if one fornicates with others, that married couple will not be together.

102
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:26,881
You know, this is admonished against.

103
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:32,350
Many do not heed admonishments these days.

104
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:37,276
There is a multitude. Every little thing has admonishments.

105
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:47,307
You know, if they follow good [advice], they will not do what is admonished against if they follow good [advice].

106
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:58,445
You know how you said that you and your husband started off not loving each other?

107
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,976
What caused your love for each other to grow?

108
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,107
You see, I...

109
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:11,007
I didn’t choose my own husband.

110
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,695
My caretaker chose for me.

111
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:23,501
Because people respected and deferred to each other, I don’t know what made my love grow.

112
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:31,233
But they told us to work in accordance with our spouses if we want to be good spouses.

113
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,221
I’ve been on the verge of coughing.

114
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:49,221
As you watched your husband, what do you like about your husband?

115
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,640
When I took care of them?

116
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:58,734
As I watched my husband, or as he was my husband

117
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:08,072
I like that we treat each other with mutual respect, not disparaging each other.

118
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:18,753
And before my husband started working, I would try to take good care of what little he caught

119
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:23,197
The animals he had caught.

120
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:38,129
In your opinion, are some of the people who get divorced now include those who abuse alcohol or other mind-altering substances?

121
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:49,341
Yes, the good thing that I just talked about at first was what people practiced.

122
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,173
Now, however, how they get divorced

123
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:03,448
The young people are no longer doing right because they take husbands they’ve chosen themselves

124
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:08,598
Because their parents don’t choose for them, and they take wives they choose.

125
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:19,873
They reason for their getting divorced is because they [marry] whom they want, not deferring to their parents.

126
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:21,711
What about this alcohol?

127
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:28,705
About this alcohol, in my observation, there has recently been an increase in alcohol.

128
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:36,880
For married couples, if her husband drinks alcohol, and his wife doesn’t drink alcohol

129
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:42,731
His wife wants her husband to get better.

130
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:49,419
She tries to have her husband stop abusing alcohol.

131
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:56,788
If a person, a woman, a person knows God and prays

132
00:14:56,801 --> 00:15:01,576
God will hear her desire, and her husband will stop drinking alcohol.

133
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:13,195
Or in a married couple if her husband drinks alcohol, and the wife joins her husband after she didn’t drink, they will destroy themselves.

134
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,432
They destroy each other, fight each other, then get a divorce.

135
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:29,645
If they understand that they’re destroying each other if they both drink alcohol, what can they do?

136
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:35,833
You know, if they realize that they’re destroying each other.

137
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:45,914
Now, we know that they stop drinking alcohol, you know, fix themselves and get better.

138
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:53,958
If married couples who drink alcohol understand themselves, understand their [situations]

139
00:15:53,964 --> 00:16:03,964
If they give up their abuse of alcohol when they want to, they can give it up through that.

140
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:08,483
There is no one who can’t. Anything can be done.

141
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:16,702
What about the children who were hurt in their minds or hearts when [the parents] drank alcohol

142
00:16:16,715 --> 00:16:25,265
When when they stop, how can the broken mental health or hearts of those children be fixed?

143
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:42,197
When these alcoholics are drunk, their children are probably hurt very deep inside.

144
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:47,560
If these parents stop doing that

145
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:59,891
Their children, well, if they start having the mind to take good care of their children to make them better

146
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,610
You know, that will probably be a long-standing hurt in a person’s heart.

147
00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:12,179
But if they try to heal, they will heal.

148
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:21,798
You mean only if those two who were alcoholics worked with their hearts?

149
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:32,842
Yes, the alcoholic [parents] these days, you know how alcoholics have help here now?

150
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:38,661
They can get better with the help of their counselors.

151
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:50,755
And married couples, I see many who are in good marriages, and they love their children.

152
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:59,374
But that one thing is the worst thing that destroys married couples these days.

153
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:06,855
When they’re drunk, you know we watch them doing unacceptable things, and they have no self-restraint.

154
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:10,743
And they do things with this woman, "loving" others.

155
00:18:10,762 --> 00:18:13,424
Because they have no more self-restraint.

156
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:27,875
If those people give it up, believing with their hearts, if they give it up in their hearts, they can get better.

157
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:34,137
And they can become better than us who have never drunk alcohol in our lives.

158
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:45,000
When couples separated a long time ago, what would these elders do or say to those who separated?

159
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:47,481
What did they say to them?

160
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:51,382
You see, I’m not too knowledgeable about the distant past.

161
00:18:51,395 --> 00:19:01,457
But when I was growing up, married couples were married couples, and they didn’t seem to separate.

162
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,558
They didn’t seem to separate to me.

163
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:14,758
You know, they respected each other before these [Western things] became a lot, and we lived well in little villages.

164
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:20,783
And we didn’t have a lot to do here in the house because our houses were small.

165
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,771
We didn’t have a lot to do.

166
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:27,684
Do you have anything else to say?

167
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:31,110
Anything important or what?

168
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:42,748
I have something important to say about what brings people to destruction.

169
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:55,042
If a person wants to live well, he can live well by obeying his parents.

170
00:19:55,205 --> 00:20:01,592
We parents will not instruct our children like this:

171
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:06,217
"When you go out, be bad." No, we will not tell them that.

172
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:11,743
We want all of our children to be good.

173
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:20,580
Also, these young people who are getting married these days

174
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:31,636
Their husbands, or when a man has too little respect for his wife, or a woman her husband, it destoys them.

175
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:36,642
They disparage themselves, making themselves more important.

176
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:40,949
I used to hear this when I took a husband:

177
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:51,249
They said that even if our husbands are ugly, or walk with a limp, no matter what they’re like, we must respect them and not disparage them.

178
00:20:51,262 --> 00:20:56,812
The reason that married couples are no longer good these days

179
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:03,319
They choose and take their own husbands without examining their characters first

180
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:10,488
They do that because they have pretty faces, yet their characters are bad.

181
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:15,401
That’s what makes them have rocky marriages.

182
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:27,858
They apparently used to instruct them a long time ago, to marry a person even if he has an ugly face, saying that he will take care of her well.

183
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,433
It turned out to be true.

184
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:40,196
Now, because married couples disparage their husbands too much, or they disparage this boy, they are not good anymore.

185
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:45,578
Because they don’t hear these pieces of traditional wisdom, they don’t know.

186
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:54,097
When a small child goes out from his parents’ when he starts going to school

187
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,397
He’s gone all day long, then goes home tired at night.

188
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,935
He can’t learn much from his parents.

189
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:04,916
Only through school...
