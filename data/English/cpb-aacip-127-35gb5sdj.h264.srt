00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,350
Hello, testing. Testing. Are you getting any reading at all?

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,510
But we are grateful to them.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:28,290
We should not be jealous of or envy those around us, wanting to be good hunters who catch a lot.

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:34,330
We must ponder and listen to the [?].

5
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,235
Am I doing the right thing to him?

6
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:59,785
If we don’t ask questions why he or another or the best of your friends...

7
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,330
...avoided from a good friend or parent or wife or son.

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,380
So, we have to ask questions if we are...

9
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:15,605
...in their mind, to their trial and errors in time of life.

10
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:25,450
To where a person that scrutinizes the other people and their elders that have...

11
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:37,800
...can gain that knowledge to where, just lot of these elders just...

12
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,600
You will never know what you’re [?], the trials and errors that you are doing

13
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:51,775
But you do not understand thinking you’re doing the right thing up until you ask questions.

14
00:01:53,075 --> 00:02:02,045
What led her to [?], then left her on that island to be drowned still remains to be seen.

15
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,650
So, based on that story, you have to...

16
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,550
...want to do to seek the answers.

17
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:23,055
Only through quesionts through your elders can you get knowledge and wisdom on how you’re going to lead your own life.

18
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,830
To take an example, you young people like to hunt.

19
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,290
You just can’t go out there and...

20
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:41,520
[?] how you have to butcher it, you have to seek knowledge from your elders.

21
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:51,245
And if oyu don’t ask any questions, seeing none of it, you just...

22
00:02:51,355 --> 00:03:00,435
...it’s, you know, I remember this traditional wisdom as a legend.

23
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,660
Remembering it now...

24
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,500
In my opinion, God helped with that legend.

25
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:15,185
He said this: "Didn’t my father, didn’t my grandfather..."

26
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,660
...wanted it to grow.

27
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:23,745
And then the spruce tree with the big [?] grew, its branches raised...

28
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:25,565
...it [?].

29
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:31,875
God helped that.

30
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,970
These days, well, we have always...

31
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:45,645
As his grandfather was struggling in his mind, that spruce tree grew as God commanded.

32
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,570
That’s all, and I’ve not said the ending in case you may not know it.

33
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,775
There’s another side to it.

34
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:55,415
At the very last request.

35
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:02,575
A thought came to this woman, but her grandfather...

36
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,210
And that’s where Christianity comes in.

37
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,540
If you truly ask from the bottom of your heart, you’ll get the answer of what you requested.

38
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:16,175
Who are you and where are you from?

39
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:24,095
I’m from Tununak, and my name is Carl, Carl Flynn.

40
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,180
I’m a part of the IRA Council in Tununak.

41
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,870
Now...

42
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:35,485
Really? IRA Council? (Yes.)

43
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:48,310
Okay, so with telling stories as you’ve said, how did it start?

44
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:56,500
Also, please tell us the very first thing you said again.

45
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,610
I’m going to repeat what I said.

46
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:10,730
The true beginning of this legend

47
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:17,815
There was never a compeltely accurate telling back then.

48
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,700
The beginning of a legend is very far from this day.

49
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:32,645
The land was thin a long time ago.

50
00:05:34,555 --> 00:05:40,945
And the little people existed back then when the land was thin a long time ago.

51
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:52,645
And their companions that they call egacuayiit that look human were always common

52
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,210
Before the time of that legend.

53
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,280
Now, I’ve been saying this:

54
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:18,310
If you are smart, if you know the entirety of what you’re like, and if you know how a good person should be

55
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,340
I’m telling you because you’re my [?great-great-great-grandchild].

56
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:41,570
You can make a legend that will help a person live well as a good person.

57
00:06:42,865 --> 00:06:51,645
If you hear a legend, do not accept it as you hear it.

58
00:06:52,890 --> 00:07:03,670
Instead, pretend that everything he is talking about is relevent to yourself, and try to understand it as it applies to you.

59
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:12,405
If you’re wise, you will think like this: "He is telling it to me."

60
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,400
If you strive to be like that legend he is talking about if it is good

61
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:32,025
If you want to be like what he is talking about, treat that legend as if it applies to yourself.

62
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:47,530
Also, some legends apply to what people are like.

63
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,140
They are fun and amazing.

64
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:06,490
But if the fun and amazing ones are not related to what people are like

65
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:17,775
Discard those and only accept the good things into your flesh and heart

66
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:23,505
So that you will become like that when you are able in the near future.

67
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:32,145
When you are able and you start trying to live your own life, choose to be like that.

68
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:37,035
Some legends especially apply to people.

69
00:08:39,880 --> 00:09:01,300
One person, one of my relatives, my own paternal aunt told us three brothers legends because she was to tell us legends.

70
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:07,073
We had fun listening to her. I had fun listening to her.

71
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:15,128
And when she was done, when that legend was over

72
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:23,910
They only told legends in the evening when they had no more chores to do, before going to sleep when they had gone to bed.

73
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:28,942
And they fell asleep to that legend all night.

74
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:38,124
They would tell legends only as they applied to people, what people should be like.

75
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:44,265
My late paternal aunt told us that legend

76
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:55,183
When she was done and finished that story, she said that we should never tell those legends to our peers.

77
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:59,736
She admonished us against telling that legend to our peers.

78
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,494
Instead, she said that it should be ours.

79
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,050
You see?

80
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:11,910
A legend like this is not a cause for irritation.

81
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:17,487
It is also something that has always been. It is also important.

82
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:23,760
A legend like this is also important.

83
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:35,898
You watch TV. You watch TV every evening.

84
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:44,935
When TVs started to come around, I enjoy watching TV.

85
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:51,987
And aside from that, aside from having fun, I apply them to myself.

86
00:10:53,547 --> 00:11:03,256
I do not want to be like what people should not be like and discard it.

87
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,470
And I take upon what a person should be like.

88
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:13,410
I apply what a person should be like to myself.

89
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:23,626
If you hear a story or legend, listen to it completely, and compare yourself to it.

90
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:27,921
You know what you were like in the past.

91
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:35,175
Apply it to your past, apply it to yourself as you listen to it.

92
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:47,922
Since we are alone and I must talk to you and give you lessons, I am giving you lessons.

93
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:51,147
And I have no such restraints to do so.

94
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:53,076
I see.

95
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:54,490
Is that...

96
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:01,141
Yes, you’ve told enough.

97
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:08,905
Look, let me add a missing part of the legend that you haven’t heard.

98
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,448
The legend is about a married couple.

99
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:29,370
The wife is a woman that did not consider herself objectionable.

100
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:31,983
And they bore a small child.

101
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:39,324
That woman didn’t consider herself objectionable, and had no qualms with her husband.

102
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:45,926
THe man however, had many qualms with his wife.

103
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:56,247
And the man didn’t let his wife know of his qualms, and she didn’t know that she was objectionable.

104
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,128
At the dawning of one day, he invited her to travel with a kayak.

105
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:15,899
And then he left her on an island in the sea that would be covered with water, and she dug for clams, qapilaat.

106
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:29,359
As the wife was having fun and enjoying herself, she realized that her husband was traveling away going back home.

107
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:34,299
"Hey you," she was surprised, "hey, are you leaving me?"

108
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:43,796
"With all of the qualms I’ve had with you since we married some time ago

109
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,162
"Pay for all of your objectionable ways there.

110
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,934
"You are tormenting my mind. I do not want to be married to you anymore."

111
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:55,109
He left here where the water would cover it.

112
00:13:56,423 --> 00:14:01,264
Would you envy and choose to be like her?

113
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:10,339
Ifyou think you’re objectionable, go to the elders and ask them questions.

114
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:16,524
Ask them questions. Before you run out of questions, you’ll become an old woman.

115
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:19,197
Let me stop there.

116
00:14:19,344 --> 00:14:20,260
Thank you.

117
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,608
Thank you so much. (Is that enough?)

118
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:23,338
Yes.

119
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,772
Okay, thank you.
