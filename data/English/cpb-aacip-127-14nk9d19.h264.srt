1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,000
Is that my mic? It is my mic.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,000
This one’s yours, this one. (Oh, I see.)

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,800
Ready? (Yes. Maybe, well, yes, okay.)

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,400
For the record, talking to Johnny K. Guy from Kwethluk.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,500
Qavarliar? (Qavarliaq, yes.)

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,400
Alright, Qavarliaq, okay.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,000
It starts with a K [in the old orthography]. [?] (Okay. Okay.)

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now, when you were young back then… (You mean what we used to eat?)

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,800
No, what did youpl go to the mountains for?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Our late father, Guy, used to work with reindeer in the mountains.

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,000
He would work herding reindeer.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Did those people have their own reindeer that they owned themselves?

13
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,500
Did those reindeer also have identifying marks?

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,000
They used to say those reindeer belonged to the government

15
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:40,000
But they would mark reindeer ears in the fall.

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,900
They also got paid for [herding] reindeer.

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,000
They would get paid, but they would never appear [in person].

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
I see.

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,000
Were there a lot of reindeer back then?

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,500
They said there weren’t too many at first, then they increased later and got dirty.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,900
The [herded] government reindeer.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,500
They also got blood from these caribout coming here from Nome.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,700
Why have they depleted now?

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,500
I don’t know. Wolves probably depleted them.

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:34,400
There are now a lot of reindeer that have come over from Nome.

26
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Because they’ve increased over there, they’ve come here.

27
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:50,800
And then, please talk about these… I can’t.

28
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,500
What you were born in time to see, the community house.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,500
They used to have Yup’ik dance festivals here with a huge community house in Kwethluk, over there in the middle upriver from the old church.

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,500
They had a huge community house and would have Yup’ik dance festivals.

31
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,700
Would the old men talk about traditional instructions there?

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I haven’t heard them.

33
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:32,000
But they would also go to dance festivals in Akiachak from here.

34
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,500
At least in the winter and summer.

35
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,700
Would they invite them?

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:46,000
They invited them. The people from Akiachak invited the people from here to go make a community house.

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:55,500
And then they made a huge community house in Akiachak tying it with [?].

38
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
What would they do when they went to the community house?

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,000
They Yup’ik danced. They would have a feast that evening, bring in various things like this

40
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,000
Hides, hides for containers, and caribou.

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,000
They brought those to dance festivals, including animal traps, various things, and cloth.

42
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:35,000
Have you heard about wars a long time ago?

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I used to hear about them, but I don’t know them.

44
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:48,000
They say they had wars here against their fellow Yupiit even going upriver on the Kuskokwim.

45
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,000
But because I’m not knowledgable, I don’t know about them because they didn’t talk about them too much.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,500
Were you born in time to see Aavaaq who used to live here?

47
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:15,000
I was born in time to see him. Aavaaq used to have a house downriver across and downriver from the fishcamp on the riverbank.

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, was he a healer?

49
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,500
He didn’t speak, but he talked with gestures.

50
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He didn’t know how to talk.

51
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,900
Was he not a shaman?

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He wasn’t a shaman.

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He liked to make little things. He even made wooden hairbrushes.

54
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,000
He always made little things.

55
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Yourpl river Kuiggluk here, where did youpl come up with that name?

56
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,500
I don’t know from where, but I heard it’s always been called Kuiggluk.

57
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,500
They say that these houses are on the old Kuiggluk [river path]

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That old river inland from Kwethluk.

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,500
They say it was an old river.

60
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When you were young, would they instruct you on things you would need to use in the wilderness when you were going to go hunt?

61
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They used to instruct me to dress warmly

62
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:58,000
That I had to travel in warm clothes. They also said I would be cold as I wandered in the wilderness.

63
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,900
Did they also tell youpl to bring things that would save youpl?

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:18,500
Yes, we would bring things, and have some food provisions in case anything happened as we traveled in the wilderness.

65
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,700
What about walking staffs that some people talk about?

66
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We always had staffs too. They said that we should cross rivers prodding it like this in case we should fall into the water.

67
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes, these days, those old pieces of traditional wisdom

68
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,700
The people back then used to adhere to them.

69
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes, our ancestors who were born before us used staffs.

70
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,000
They also probably hunted with staffs because they were quick on foot.

71
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:22,700
What about these young people, children, these days, should they listen to those pieces of Yup’ik wisdom?

72
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,000
They should hear about them, and walk around with staffs.

73
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:36,000
But they don’t seem to do that. Some don’t have staffs.

74
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,500
To you, these young people these days

75
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,500
These children that you are seeing these days, are they more mischievous to you than before?

76
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,900
They’re not like before.

77
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They look like they’re getting more mischievous.

78
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,500
They don’t obey their admonishments like before.

79
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why does it seem to be like that?

80
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:19,400
I don’t know. It’s probably their minds when they have the idea to do that.

81
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:29,000
They’ve also probably become like this because their parents, mothers, and fathers do not teach them anymore.

82
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Probably.

83
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,000
They don’t teach their children too much anymore.

84
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,400
They sometimes admonish them against doing that and against using those.

85
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,000
They admonish them, but they don’t listen.

86
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I wonder why these young people are getting disobedient?

97
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:08,500
It’s probably because they don’t listen to traditional wisdom and refuse instruction.

98
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,900
Even though they are told not to do it, they do.

99
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,500
These schools are probably exacerbating that for them.

100
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,000
These schools also get destroyed.

101
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,500
These descendants of before were not like that.

102
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,900
But now, they destroy even schools, various things.

103
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,000
They’ve also started destroyed unoccupied buildings.

104
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Some of the young people from here probably do not understand Yup’ik anymore.

105
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,800
Because the little ones now always speak English.

106
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,500
Consider that [they spoke] Yup’ik before, not knowing English and then they started going to school.

107
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:10,500
And then the people from upriver do not speak Yup’ik too much because they’re Upper Kuskokwim Athabascans.

108
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:21,300
But even though they speak English, do they really understand when they speak English?

109
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:34,000
For you, should our speaking in Yup’ik, our Yup’ik language not be lost?

110
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,500
Our Yup’ik language should not be lost.

111
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Couple it with English, translating what is said in English into Yup’ik

112
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Because they ask us to translate like that, and these Caucasians who aren’t Yup’ik like us ask for translations.

113
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And some Yupiit ask for others to speak to Caucasians for them.

114
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Some of the old people say this:

115
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:30,000
They said that when these churches first came, they ended up reading these written Qaneryarat, what they call the Bible.

116
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,400
They said they read and started understanding them.

117
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:44,500
They realized that they were not different from the old Yup’ik wisdom and traditional isntructions.

118
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Is that true for you?

119
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It’s true for me.

120
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:58,500
When they obey those instructions that the ancestors taught

121
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:12,700
When our earth here was not heavily populated back then, the land was probably thin

122
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:25,000
Or the people probably talked gauging the weather.

123
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Should we not forget passing on traditional wisdom, our Yup’ik way of passing on wisdom to our young people here?

124
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:57,000
A person should not forget traditional wisdom from his father or from other people.

125
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:19,000
They should talk about it, traditional wisdom about nature, traditional wisdom about nature.

126
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,000
They’re probable the voice of [nature].

127
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Okay, we’re rolling. (Rolling, rolling, okay.)

128
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:39,600
The people of old talked about these great hunters.

129
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,000
Are there scarce any great hunters these days?

130
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,200
These days, they’re not like [traditional] great hunters.

131
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,000
And they don’t go hunting at night, early in the morning, anymore.

132
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,500
They’re not like great hunters anymore.

133
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Back then, they probably called those who were good at catching animals great hunters.

134
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,800
They would travel to the wilderness, and go early to far away places on foot.

135
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,500
They probably referred to those who were good at catching animals great hunters.

136
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:42,500
And then, you know our subsistence way of life?

137
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:50,000
It seems that the laws of our Caucasians counterparts is destroying it.

138
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,500
Is that not good to you?

139
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:07,500
It’s because these Caucasians who are not Yup’ik are partially destroying it somehow.

140
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,500
They even have laws against hunting too many animals.

141
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
They have laws against [hunting] some animals we eat.

142
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:30,500
And they sometimes [punish] many who catch a lot.

143
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:49,000
For you, would it be good if we Yupiit who live on our lands started governing ourselves?

144
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,500
They have leaders like this:

145
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:04,500
They are governed by leaders from out of state who tell these villages to elect leaders

146
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,300
And they tell those other villages to elect leaders too.

147
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:18,000
They tell them to meet and govern what they should do.

148
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:33,500
These school that have started appearing in villages.

149
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,000
They’ve already started [appearing].

150
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,500
For you, are they helpful for Yup’ik youth?

151
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:54,000
They will be helpful if they don’t speak or understand English

152
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:02,000
Because it won’t be helpful if they don’t understand what they should do.

153
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:10,000
When they don’t understand, they don’t know what to do.

154
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,000
What about this Yup’ik language?

155
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Our Yup’ik language, we Yupiit speak the Yup’ik language.

156
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:34,000
And then these Caucasians ask to be taught Yup’ik like us

157
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:45,000
Or they ask for translations from a Yup’ik speaking the Yup’ik langauge.

158
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:51,000
They say there a lot of people who don’t speak the same language.

159
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And then… what was I just going to ask you?

160
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,900
Can you stop it for a second? I forgot what I was [going to ask].

161
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,400
Now, this is the last question I’m going to ask you:

162
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:33,800
These young people from here, or even from other surrounding villages

163
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Do you want to tell them anything that they should remember for the future or that they would use now?

164
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I’m not sure what I should say to them.

165
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,000
I don’t really know since I’m not knowledgable.

166
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:14,900
I thought you might want them to hear something from their parents.

167
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:22,800
Parents must admonish their children against doing [bad] things

168
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:32,000
Or even if they’re not parents, they say they should teach them even if they’re not young.

169
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Is speaking Yup’ik beneficial?

170
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:45,000
This Yup’ik language is beneficial for Yupiit like this.

171
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:57,500
Caucasians ask to be taught Yup’ik, and Yupiit ask to be taght English.

172
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:11,500
