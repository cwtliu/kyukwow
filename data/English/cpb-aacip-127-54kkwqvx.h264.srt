1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,940
Well now, Qunuin, come here.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,960
Now, I don’t have any other memories, yes.

3
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:18,285
However, I have memories of the people I was born in time to see.

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,220
I want to tell them about the old ones before. (Yes, okay, yes.)

5
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:27,935
If it is opportune.

6
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:34,695
You see, I grew up over in Chefornak.

7
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:42,805
I grew up in Chefornak. It turned out...

8
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:56,778
And their descendants, they said that the descendants of our descendants would begin what people would be like on this earth.

9
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,550
They will start it.

10
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:17,612
And then they said that their future descendants, it seems that the people have started going through this these days.

11
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:22,531
It seemed they spoke as if seeing it.

12
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:27,481
I reached this age and remember them.

13
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:34,619
They talked about it as if they were looking at the people that would live in these lands.

14
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,738
They said, "Pity."

15
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:50,782
They said that when they have reached the point that they would become like that, even the young people would become like puppies.

16
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:54,626
Look at it now.

17
00:01:55,002 --> 00:02:06,389
I completely understand that those people would talk about this time as if they were truly seeing it.

18
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:14,514
Oh my goodness, and now, these people have reached it, every person from the villages.

19
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:19,608
And none of them was left out as all villages reached it.

20
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:33,871
They said that people would become like when the young people start disregarding traditional wisdom, when they don’t adhere to traditional wisdom anymore.

21
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:43,359
Oh my goodness, also, my grandfather over in Chefornak who was known as Elegtaq

22
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:56,215
My grandfather Elegtaq would tell stories. Apaprently, he grew up across there around Eek, upriver from there.

23
00:02:56,784 --> 00:03:05,346
They called that place Allauguulleq. My grandfather Elegtaq was from there.

24
00:03:05,722 --> 00:03:17,022
I also used to see the old woman they called Aluskaq’s Mother out there on Nelson Island.

25
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:23,729
He said that they were not separated when it was called Allgauguulleq.

26
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:31,647
He said that their lives were not apart from each other.

27
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:46,109
Well, I have just told that story. Consider it like this.

28
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:57,709
And, pity me, even though I didn’t use all of the traditional wisdom, I believed.

29
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:06,472
I believed what little wisdom was passed down to me. I have not obeyed every piece of wisdom passed down to me though.

30
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:13,709
But when I heard people instructing, I would believe.

31
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:19,803
Also, my instructors would tell me this:

32
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:29,816
"Now see here, even if any of your peers do anything to you, never retaliate with bad intent.

33
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:37,216
"Live by treating people well, and never be like them.

34
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:46,204
"Instead, speak of and treat that person who wronged you well until he goes forth as a better person."

35
00:04:46,679 --> 00:05:01,854
Oh my, when a person indeed had done bad, I would be extremely thankful when they would stop looking back. I would be extremely thankful.

36
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:09,698
When we came to an agreement, I would be very thankful for him.

37
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:22,948
Oh my goodness, I just told that story now.

38
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:32,910
I told very little of the story of one of the people I was born in time to see, very little.

39
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:41,842
And now, I’m going to speak about current times, cousin.

40
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:55,267
These days, you see, I had this many children, thirteen.

41
00:05:56,204 --> 00:06:12,392
And now, I cannot succumb to my mind’s dejection, because I will not be doing it to myself when I am dejected, but to those who’ve gone.

42
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:17,555
Also, I fear that they may no longer by worthy to be taken by God.

43
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:25,649
But I thank God because he lets me see those who’ve gone from me.

44
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:32,000
They didn’t show themselves, but God lets me see them.

45
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:40,707
You see, I woke up and night and relaxes, and without deviating, I took my tobacco and chewed.

46
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:52,313
And when I had chewed for long enough, I took them out, put them in, and put up the container. I lay facing the back of the bed, and shot up and stayed still.

47
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:59,514
Oh my, as I was staying still, there was a bright light around me.

48
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:11,695
Oh my, when the light came upon me, I opened my eyes and looked up to what looked like a circle of light above me.

49
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:15,501
There were three people inside.

50
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:24,720
I looked up to find that the light up there enveloped my children.

51
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:35,233
Here was their older sister Pangall’aq, Nanugaq, and the third was Uyanguaq with whom they shared a mother downriver.

52
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:41,602
They were wearing Heavenly clothes that they never wore before.

53
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:46,946
Oh my, there were happy up there and pitied me.

54
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:53,871
I faced the front of the bed toward them, looked up, and watched them.

55
00:07:53,884 --> 00:07:57,884
As I saw them, I thanked God.

56
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:08,428
I thanked him because no other allowed me to see them, only he allowed me to see them.

57
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:26,478
You seem as I stopped and stayed still, up from where they were, because I didn’t look away from them, a man spoke from where they were. Wow, he definitely knows.

58
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:33,709
"Mary, you will also be like this as these are."

59
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:44,978
Oh my, I thought I was going to be pulled away right then, but my dear grandchildren from out there appeared here in front of me.

60
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:54,916
My goodness, when they appeared and watched only me, they, you know...

61
00:08:56,154 --> 00:09:01,741
They don’t stay apart from me. They always gather around me.

62
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:13,372
When they had gathered in front of me, I told them, I told him

63
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:26,529
Only at that moment, when my dear grandchildren here were missing me, I asked them to leave me just for that moment.

64
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:36,073
I told them to be with me as much as they wanted later when it was time for me.

65
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:40,929
Oh my, I was disconcerted.

66
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:51,873
When I was finished, when that was finished, the light up there was starting to go out. And they had me watch them as they were in some place.

67
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:59,017
They had me see them as they were there before the light started to go out.

68
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:05,561
When I stopped watching them, it started to go out, and winked out.

69
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:15,136
Also, I didn’t not sleep but given new awareness like this, cousin, I was giving new awareness.

70
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:25,805
My goodness, young people, what a paradise. The paradise where everyone wants to live in.

71
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:31,417
It was very bright. There is no light like it.

72
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:39,561
It seemed that as I looked around from here, like this, I wasn’t sleeping

73
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:47,968
It seemed that the world was like this as the land meets the horizon.

74
00:10:49,162 --> 00:11:00,725
The grass on the land was extremely green, seeming like the green [ulvaiyaaq].

75
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:06,037
The land there was too beautiful to behold.

76
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:19,956
And when I briefly watch TV once in a while and see something green, I wonder why I don’t remember that extremely green place.

77
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:31,512
It seemed that the land in the entire world all the way to the horizon was like that.

78
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:37,643
And there was no tundra like the tundra that we have here.

79
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:46,912
It was so smooth, and I didn’t see a lake or a creek in there.

80
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:54,506
My goodness, as I turned my neck like this going this way

81
00:11:54,725 --> 00:12:07,450
When I turned this way, I saw three people standing wearing long white robes.

82
00:12:08,581 --> 00:12:16,519
When I watched them over there, I realized that two of them over there were accompanied by Jesus.

83
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:24,044
I gave greater thanks for seeing Jesus.

84
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:33,494
Also, I started expecting to see him first and foremost during the fall at the time.

85
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:37,432
I kept expecting to see him.

86
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:42,282
And the things outside at night when sleep left me

87
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:55,989
When the things outside started clamoring in the night, I would get up after trying to lay still and look around outside, and look at the stars above.

88
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:00,477
When nothing else would happen, I would sit and lie down.

89
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:10,165
You young people, you see, that world, oh my goodness, it is such a wonderful world.

90
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:20,759
That paradise had nothing bad. There was nothing bad to be seen. That world looks very good.

91
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:31,584
It was very bright, extremely bright. And yet there was no sun in that world.

92
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:39,035
And yet it was bright, very bright, [without a source of light].

93
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:44,623
Oh my goodness.

94
00:13:45,142 --> 00:14:00,167
As I was looking around liek that, I would watch those people too. As I did that, they would disappear and I wouldn’t know where they went.

95
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:11,423
When they disappeared, I would pull back my neck and look in front of me to see two of them still in front of me.

96
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:17,911
And since they were a little far, I wouldn’t recognize Jesus’ companions though I tried.

97
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:32,192
Oh my, I looked in front of me to see two people, the taller one on this side, and the one next to him was shorter.

98
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:41,680
I looked at those two and it seemed that the taller one on this side was Qayuq’s father.

99
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:46,406
I felt that I recognized him by what his mannerisms.

100
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:55,750
It was certainly Qayuq’s father that started to live here, the one who started to live here.

101
00:14:56,925 --> 00:15:01,988
That’s all for that.

102
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:17,275
You see, when I stopped seeing them, after I watched those two, I lost sight of them with no idea where they went even though I was watching them.

103
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:28,713
Oh my, it seemed that after that, our pitiful world that we live in without thinking anything of it

104
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:44,557
When my mind came upon where I was together with them, it seemed it was a little red when I was alongside them

105
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:50,863
Because we live in this world without thinking anything of it.

106
00:15:53,357 --> 00:15:55,382
Oh my goodness.

107
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:10,101
After that, I pulled my neck back and I was slow as if my body were closing up.

108
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:24,676
When it closed up, I realized that I was sitting on my bed where I sleep. I was sitting on my bed.

109
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:32,751
I was in distress through I was like this imagining being in that paradise.

110
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:40,583
And I thought this as I was standing there, when I thought I was standing there:

111
00:16:40,920 --> 00:17:00,160
Oh my goodness, where are all those young people. Oh my goodness, I wish that they would live in that paradise in great joy forever with no worry about what may happen in the future.

112
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:17,274
"And they would have no worries about what may happen to them. And they would live there with no worries about what we call death if they live by the instructions given to them."

113
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,418
You see?

114
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:31,181
Now, I imagine these things because I do this repeatedly.

115
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:39,487
Something causes me to do that. I don’t do it by myself. Whatever it is sees me and causes me to do that.

116
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:50,781
It also gives me light like this seeing how I am. It probably takes pity on me.

117
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:58,106
You see, we also used to learn about the Bible over in Kwigillingok back then.

118
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:08,550
You see, when I went out and would be on my way to cross over, I would think first about my request.

119
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:18,550
When I crossed, because I would only leave your dear cousin in the house

120
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:26,613
Light came upon me in a circle around me like this.

121
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:29,888
It turned out that it started.

122
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:35,575
Starting from there, it comes upon me when it wants to.

123
00:18:36,263 --> 00:18:49,250
However, my mind does not grieve over my many children because they’re not anywhere else, and they are not lost.

124
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:59,725
Since the first ones appear to me, I think that they are not lost

125
00:18:59,726 --> 00:19:06,188
Also becaues the younger ones go before they come upon anything bad.

126
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:18,164
But the ones that grew a little who were going to go, I would understand because they were clear, I would understand.

127
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:26,801
And the little ones, you know, would raise their hands and be happy.

128
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:35,495
But my mind does not want to [disregard] how they were like that.

129
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:46,283
But now, I think about going after them, going after them.

130
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:54,758
I do not want to think of my fellow people in any way except through love.

131
00:19:57,689 --> 00:20:04,589
I only want to think of every one of you, my family, my fellow people, with love.

132
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:13,858
I have the mind to see with my entire body what I’ve seen.

133
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:24,496
The people that I was born to see back then lived hard lives.

134
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:30,584
Because they obeyed the wisdom passed down to them, they lived long lives.

135
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:36,290
And we didn’t hear of any misfortune in the village I grew up in.

136
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:46,296
Only after a very long time, one of the people who had gotten old would pass away.

137
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:52,559
And they were nothing like how it is these days.

138
00:20:53,172 --> 00:21:00,134
They wouldn’t know of any misfortune for a long time. And they would hear of misfortune from areas around them.

139
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:08,297
They would finally hear of something happening to someone after a long time.

140
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:11,522
But only after a long time.
