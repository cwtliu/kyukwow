1
00:00:00,942 --> 00:00:04,455
Yes, he first wants to thank you for coming.

2
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:10,567
Also, I will say his name.

3
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:15,706
This is Fred Ollie. He’s the principal of the school here.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,806
Especially for the adults and the young people who speak Yup’ik

5
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,514
It was given to them.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,694
And so, he said that he would want to do that with this...

7
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,569
... he wants to do it specifically for you.

8
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:45,585
Twelve years ago, I came to Alaska and went to the village of St. Mary’s to begin teaching.

9
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:51,289
And needless to say, I didn’t know much about Alaska.

10
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:54,028
I didn’t know much about Western Alaska.

11
00:00:55,105 --> 00:01:02,659
And I met, one of the first people I met was a nun, was a Catholic nun by the name of Sister Scholastica.

12
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:06,570
And some of you in this room know Sister Scholastica.

13
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:09,326
She’s still doing the laundry at St. Mary’s.

14
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:15,408
And she gave me the best advice that anyone ever gave me.

15
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:21,911
She said, "You’re new to Alaska. You don’t know anything about these people.

16
00:01:22,913 --> 00:01:30,278
"So what I want you to do is to say very little and to listen, because there’s a lot you need to learn."

17
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:38,215
And it was very, very good advice, because even now, twelve years later, I still find that I do too much talking and not enough listening

18
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:42,358
Because there’s still a lot that the elders of this area can teach us.

19
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:48,454
What do they call nuns again?

20
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:57,222
He said that he came to know a nun by the name of Sister Scholastica.

21
00:01:58,547 --> 00:02:08,095
When I was at St. Mary’s, I met students from all over, all over the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in the coast.

22
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:18,253
And in 1974, I had a class of students who I was particulary fond of.

23
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:22,532
And those are these students here.

24
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,263
And I promised them when I left St. Mary’s

25
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:34,370
That no matter where I went, I would alwyas keep a picture of that class in my office, and I always have.

26
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:42,178
I lived in Juneau for a while, and I kept a picture of these students on my wall in Juneau. And now here in Bethel, I keep them on my wall.

27
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:50,543
And one of the reasons I do that, is because I look at these various individuals and I still keep in contact with them.

28
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:58,697
And it makes me realize how much things have changed in this area

29
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:02,496
Because I can see the change in these students as they grow up.

30
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:14,382
And when he came here, he said that he kept it in his office.

31
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:21,223
He uses this because he watches things changing.

32
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:25,806
He can see that they are not like before...

33
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:29,074
Pass this around. Some people want to see it.

34
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,361
When I look at the pictures of those students, and I think about what they’re doing now

35
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:42,758
One thought comes to mind...

36
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:48,441
...being happy, living at home, or living somewhere else, but happy with themselves.

37
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:56,810
Students who feel good about who they are are the students who did exactly what I think this conference is all about.

38
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,711
They’re the students who took time...

39
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:01,371
...people in their villages, and I really mean that.

40
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:06,113
When I look back, and I see the students again who are happy and successful...

41
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,514
...to learn from people who have lived a long time and have had many rich and wonderful experiences.

42
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:15,962
And then...

43
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:20,276
I want to conclude by again welcoming you to this week.

44
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,455
I want to thank you for taking the time to be with us.

45
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,410
I’m very excited about it because this week, I get to be a student too.

46
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:37,118
I’m going to try to sit in on as many of the talks as possible so I can learn just along with everyone else.

47
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:44,457
So once again, I want to thank you for coming to Bethel, for sharing your experiences with us.

48
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:50,662
And if there’s anything I can do to make your stay happier and more enjoyable, please let me know.

49
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:02,425
Thank you very much.

50
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:11,824
Recently, when Nastashia called me to talk about this

51
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:25,129
When she asked me to talk to you about how to continue our way of life or our culture

52
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:28,057
I was daunted.

53
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:33,214
Though I was anxious, I was daunted.

54
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:36,327
I was thinking like this:

55
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:50,422
Since I am younger, I thought it would be better of our elders took care of it.

56
00:05:54,561 --> 00:06:00,462
I will work on this as best as I can

57
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:04,329
But I will not go for long.

58
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:14,933
Some of you probably know that there was a meeting up in Kasigluk

59
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:19,685
Our elders from here on the Kuskokwim and the Yukon.

60
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:29,065
I wasn’t there. I was not deliberately absent.

61
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:38,008
I wanted to be there, but since we are not always free from work, I wasn’t there.

62
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:43,272
But I was told that when you held the meeting there

63
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:57,065
That you worked on what our way of life is like.

64
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:09,534
For the benefit of those of you who have some limited understanding of the English language, let me paraphrase the main points.

65
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:19,633
Very recently, when Nastashia Martin called me to speak on the issue of how you could continue with the Yup’ik language

66
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:21,800
I’m sorry, Yup’ik values

67
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:28,928
Although I was enthusiastic about it, I also had some reservations

68
00:07:28,943 --> 00:07:36,808
Primarily because of the fact that I feel that it’s an issue that can best be addressed by our elders.

69
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:43,907
I am young, and because I am young, I feel that I have a lot to learn.

70
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:52,886
But I’m going to try my best under the circumstances.

71
00:07:53,808 --> 00:08:02,326
Very recently, there was a conference at Kasigluk where the elders of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta were the prime people who attended the conference.

72
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:07,176
Although I did not have the privilege of attending this conference

73
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:13,382
I understand that the main focus of the conference dealt with the issue of preserving our way of life.

74
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:20,248
I would like to have been there, however, circumstances sometimes relating with jobs prevents that.

75
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:27,964
And so, I just mentioned what I would talk about

76
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:35,418
I had thought that our adults would be better suited to cover it.

77
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:44,645
Our elders here instruct us

78
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,212
And they show us what’s in store for us.

79
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:59,014
It’s because they know what’s in store for us since they’ve lived.

80
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:04,581
Look, let us examine it.

81
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:13,141
Before we started having school in English, our elders saw it.

82
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:20,524
It’s clear that we will start speaking only in English.

83
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:32,269
Some of you probably know Pavila who was from Qinaq.

84
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:34,425
My grandfather.

85
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:41,078
He would tell me this:

86
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:51,276
He said that when he traveled with a sled when he was young, he would come by two Caucasians by chance.

87
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:57,382
And the one day, he said to me

88
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:06,921
Yet sometimes now, there would be two Caucasians in one village.

89
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:12,305
Now, the date of that is around the late 1950’s.

90
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:22,155
He mentioned this: "Their tongues are increasing.

91
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:28,155
"And it would probably be better if you learned their languages."

92
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:35,035
That’s his wisdom, though he never spoke English.

93
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:50,604
The wisdom of our ancestors appeared like that through my grandfather.

94
00:10:55,732 --> 00:11:00,228
At that time, I didn’t understand what he was saying, nor what he meant.

95
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:09,709
Yet now, as I’ve started working and observing, it turns out that what he said was absolutely true.

96
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:22,221
I somehow feel that the main speaker this morning on this subject, how you could continue with Yup’ik values, should be one of the elders

97
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:33,626
Because in my opinion, they are the real people who should be giving us this guidance on the issue.

98
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:43,129
It is them who have given us guidance so that what is left of our values can be preserved.

99
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:49,999
It is them who had the wisdom to push for a Western type of education

100
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:55,846
So that we could be able to at least see and hopefully understand what is happening today.

101
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:11,062
For example, my grandfather Pavila who is from Qinaq was telling me that in his youth, when he was traveling throughout the region with a sled

102
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:15,877
That sometimes, he saw more than one white man in the whole region.

103
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:29,129
He said, however, in the late 1950’s, he said there are more and more of them in the region.

104
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:33,835
And sometimes, there are even more than one white person in a village.

105
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:44,379
He said at the time that you should learn their tongue, you should learn their language

106
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:49,684
So that you could at least understand what is it that you want.

107
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:59,192
It was through him that the wisdom of our elders was brought forth.

108
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:09,128
He saw much in advance, what was going to happen today.

109
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:17,748
I’m very thankful that through his wisdom that they pushed us for education.

110
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:22,316
Going forward.

111
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:27,584
Let’s go over my work.

112
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:36,087
How Yup’ik culture will continue.

113
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:49,247
You know that I work with land at Calista Corporation

114
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,524
And I work with how to take care of the land.

115
00:13:56,345 --> 00:14:03,443
It is not difficult to merely take care of the land

116
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:16,132
But it gets difficult when we try to combine our ways and Western ways to take care of it.

117
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:29,247
Our ancestors, we, and our descendants originate from the land.

118
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:41,803
Our ancestors utilized this land.

119
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:52,000
You see, when we go outside, or we breathe what our counterparts call air.

120
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:56,230
And if we don’t have that, we will suffocate.

121
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:11,411
Our people utilize this land for survival, for absolute survival.

122
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:23,672
We hunt animals from the land, then put our catch on the table and eat them.

123
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:41,246
And then sometimes when we hunt, we would use sometimes use the hide to make clothes, make skin boots, or those old skin boots.

124
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:53,328
I’m talking about those with this in mind: this land keeps us alive.

125
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:06,722
And then, the things from the ocean keep us alive.

126
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:19,279
When this land gives us anything through our creator, let us be thankful

127
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:24,886
And be humble.

128
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:35,672
And I think it would be good if we help those around us through what we get.

129
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:48,280
As most of you may know, one of my major responsibilities with Calista Corporation is to run and manage Land and Natural Resources Department.

130
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:55,197
Land management in and of itself is not difficult.

131
00:16:57,754 --> 00:17:06,869
But if one were to look at land management strictly from the standpoint of Western land management

132
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:22,935
However, it gets difficult when one begins to look at land from the standpoint of Yup’ik values and trying to put Western values into it.

133
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:31,952
The very basis of our society is land, the Yup’ik society.

134
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:40,919
Our ancestors looked at land much the same way that we look at the air we breathe today.

135
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,187
We need air to breathe so that we may survive.

136
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:56,429
In the beginning, and even today, the Yup’ik people have always been land users.

137
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:04,088
We survived with the land and what the land provided us.

138
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:08,473
Land provided us with clothing.

139
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:21,274
We needed to dress ourselves so that we can protect, we can be protected from any kind of weather.

140
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:29,407
The sea also provided us with clothing and food.

141
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:43,297
My point here being: land is something our society has needed and will probably need for a long time to come to survive.

142
00:18:45,505 --> 00:18:55,560
What it has provided us, we must receive thankfully, humbly, and we must share that wealth with others.

143
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,660
Continuing on.

144
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:12,209
But how will our way of life and our culture continue?

145
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:24,033
We are told, "Please focus when you’re in school."

146
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:35,286
And then when we are requested or told that, "Focus when you’re in school," what does it mean?

147
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,879
And then who will teach us?

148
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:55,495
Now, let us ask ourselves, "Who will teach us?"

149
00:19:56,517 --> 00:20:04,979
Now look behind you, and look at those next to you, or look around here.

150
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:11,297
Those who will teach us are sitting here.

151
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:28,736
Since they have lived, if they, our elders here, talk to us about our way of life

152
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:38,176
If we obey them, we may one day live with little hardship.

153
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:47,451
Let’s do it.

154
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,396
When our elders speak to us about something

155
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:57,044
And we are thankful when they instruct us

156
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,528
Let us listen.

157
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:09,649
And if we don’t stop at listening, but obey some of what they say, we probably will not have much difficult times.

158
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:14,330
Just who is to be our teacher?
