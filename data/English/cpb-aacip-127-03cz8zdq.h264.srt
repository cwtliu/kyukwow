1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
That’ll be useful.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Yes.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Right, we’re ready.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Okay.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay, for the record, speaking to James Guy, Kwethluk.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Were you born in time to see those who lived in the community house?

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,000
I was born in time to see them.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And I always went to listen to them speaking right after they took fire baths.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,500
I would go listen to the words of the old men the men I thought of as old because I was a small boy.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:57,000
I thought it was fun when they spoke. They would speak as they were.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,500
And even when they knew what he was talking about his peers would listen to him.

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
And then when he made a small mistake, they would tell him that he had made a mistake.

13
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Yes.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Whatpl did they used to talk about?

15
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Various things, those who were shamans, shamans with some power.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They would talk about those, even how they held running races.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,500
And how warriors attacked, because there had always been warriors that shot each other with arrows.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,000
They would talk about those.

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,000
I see.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,900
You see…

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Were those community houses like schools?

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,500
They weren’t like schools.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Also, when someone misbehaved like this down there what we call those who’ve stolen people’s tools

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:18,500
When these elders were done taking fire baths, they would get him telling him that there had been trouble in their village.

25
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,900
They wanted to try him, to assuage [the situation].

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,500
And then they brought him, then admonished him together not to do that again.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,700
Saying that stealing is bad.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,900
That’s what they revealed to me.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Also, my wife and I last winter, because I can’t work very hard ever since I became weak

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,500
We2 would get salted fish last summer telling my children2.

31
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:06,000
And then last winter, we2 went to get it because there were three [containers of] salted fish.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,500
Two of them, and half of this barrel, someone had taken half, and only a little [was left].

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I was sad because they wouldn’t be returned. I didn’t say anything.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,500
That’s why I really want to say something now because people will hear it.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,500
This is what it’s like,

36
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:45,500
It’s also in those ancient commandments, [the] Ten Commandments, it’s in there: “Thou shall not steal,” “Teglegyaqunak.”

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes, that’s why I’m admonishing all of the people of the land now

39
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:11,500
I’m admonishing them that even if they see a person’s things or even if they come upon fish camps not to take anything.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,500
But if they want to take anything, do this:

41
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Write on a piece of paper that a person is taking that much and write his name.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,500
If [s]he does that, the owner will be grateful.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
[S]he will also say this: “[S]he probably let me know because [s]he’s lacking. I’m thankful that [s]he did that.”

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let the owner know with a piece of paper even if [s]he’s gone.

45
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,000
And when I was young and healthy, that person… You know Pinky.

46
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:55,000
When I was lacking up in the mountains, because I lacked sometimes

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
When I came upon his camp, even if I wanted to use something, I never did.

48
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:12,000
And then when I saw him, I would tell him that even when I lacked even though I came upon his camp that I didn’t touch anything.

49
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,000
He would instruct me like this:

50
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:22,500
The next time I am lacking something important his provisions are put inside the barrel.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He said that I should open it, look for what I need, and take it

52
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,500
And he said to write my name, and how much I’ve taken from that barrel.

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,500
But I never did that.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I haven’t completely lacked anything important

55
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,000
Because I always traveled in the wilderness over there when I was young.

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Also...

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,500
What about these, were you born in time to see Aavaaq?

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
Yes, I was born in time to see him.

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,500
I’ve heard, I’ve probably heard wrong, that he was a shaman.

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The poor guy wasn’t a shaman.

61
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,000
Poor guy, I see.

62
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,900
The poor guy wasn’t a shaman.

63
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,000
But he was, you know, treated by a shaman [in utero], yes.

64
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,000
People said that he was treated by a shaman [in utero].

65
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,000
They only say that he was treated by a shaman.

66
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,000
How?

67
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,900
That he was treated by a shaman.

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,500
He was named Taqukaq to keep him clinging to life. (Shamans used to treat them in utero by giving them names.)

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,900
He didn’t [treat] himself?

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,900
Yes, shamans did that to him.

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,900
They say that that’s why when he was crawling when he did this, eating plants, grass

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,500
This part where he ate grass would turn green.

73
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,700
And they say that his mother never admonished him [against that].

74
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,500
The poor guy wasn’t a shaman, but he was treated by one like that.

75
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Were you born in time to see these…

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,900
What are reindeer in Yup’ik again?

77
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,500
You mean tuntut?

78
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,500
Tuntut. (Yes.)

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Were those…

80
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,900
I was born in time to see them. (Please talk about them.)

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes, because I liked to go with my father to mark reindeer

82
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,500
I used to go with them to herd reindeer in Akiachak.

83
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,500
In the morning, they would go up from Akiachuk to mark reindeer.

84
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
They said that they would corral them from a massive meadow over there.

85
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,900
And from there, they said that they would take them to the waiting area so that they could look around.

86
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
The fences had names.

87
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,500
And from the waiting area there, they would bring them in through the corraling path.

88
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,500
The corraling path wasn’t long. It was narrow.

89
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The reindeer would go through there one at a time.

90
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,900
Those who were fast were dangerous.

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,700
They would even suddenly stand and tread over the others.

92
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,500
And one person would count them.

93
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
[S]he never made a mistake, holding large papers, calling out.

94
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And over there, there were four wrestlers coming out of that corraling path.

95
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,500
When it was overflowing over there, the wrestlers would wait to catch them across from each other like this.

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,500
And then when its head appeared, they would take it right away, wrestle it, and mark it.

97
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
However, they would let out those that were marked.

98
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
They would only mark the ones that weren’t marked.

99
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,000
What do you mean maagluki?

100
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,000
Mark them on their ears. Yes.

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
With a knife?

102
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,500
Yes, with a knife.

103
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,500
You see, the callers knew the reindeer.

104
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,900
[Belonging] to that person…

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,900
I never forget something.

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,500
I was amazed at that extremely white one.

107
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,500
How did this reindeer get white?

108
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,500
One day, it went through that corraling path through what they call the nutek.

109
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
When it arrived, someone over there called it.

110
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
I’ve never forgotten this, what he said:

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
“Qayaksuk’s there.”

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That reindeer apparently belonged to Qayaksuk.

113
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,900
The callers knew them by their ears.

114
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,000
And when they took them out of that wrestling area over there

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,500
They brought it out again to the fence.

116
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
They wouldn’t let them go about right away either.

117
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,500
When that last [area with a] fence was full

118
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
They would open them and let those reindeer out.

119
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,000
And they closed it when they were all through.

120
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,500
They freed them, except for those that were still to come.

121
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,000
It was fun watching them have fun.

122
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,900
The workers [on the field] also had workers down in the camp.

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,500
They had cooks.

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
They probably paid their cooks with reindeer.

125
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,000
When I went down, I would see that they used half of a tank as a cooking pot.

126
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,000
They probably put the entire reindeer herd in.

127
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And so, because that multitude would go along with women

128
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,500
The [women] with less responsibility who were not taking care of children

129
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:22,000
The people would finish that huge pot, half of a tank, when they had lunch.

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In English, they would have break time, lunch break time.

131
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
There were no Caucasians.

132
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They would say it’s time to eat at 12 o’clock.

133
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Were they the only ones…

134
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,000
They used to in Akiachak.

135
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But when they did it towards here up on Akulikutaq Corral, that’s where they went.

136
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,000
But because I thought it was far since I was small, I didn’t go with them.

137
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It was also because I was a student at that time.

138
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,000
But when they went to Akiachak, I would go along since it was close.

139
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Back when youpl herded reindeer, were there wolves?

140
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,000 -->
Yes, there were.

141
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There always used to be wolves.

142
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,000
There were always wolves in my old man’s stories.

143
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He would say this:

144
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,000
“It drove the reindeer and killed one, those wolves.”

145
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But when the reindeer declined, when they were taken under the governement

146
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
When those reindeer were taken under the government

147
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,000
He stopped herding, he stopped herding.

148
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
They also said that reindeer would sometimes go, go over a hill, and they disappeared from the end.

149
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,000
They think that the legendary little people took them.

150
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Eventually, they said that the reindeer…

151
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It had become covered in reindeer all over, up in the marsh, mountains, and across there.

152
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,000
But that happened; wolves aren’t the only ones that depleted them.

153
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:45,000
But that said that they were quickly depleted when they vanished like that.

154
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
This is what I heard:

155
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,900
They said that the government brought those reindeer herding places here.

156
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And then they said that they had teachers from outside

157
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
They brought a Saami person here to teach people how to herd reindeer.

158
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:25,000
And then they said that when they left, Yupiit took care of reindeer herds and they were depleted because they didn’t take care of them well.

159
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,900
Is that true?

160
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,900 
No, that’s not true.

161
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
They weren’t taken care of badly.

162
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,500
That old man of mine used to talk about them like that.

163
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,000
He said that wolves weren’t the only ones that depleted them, but they vanished.

164
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,000
When they go out of view like that behind hills, they vanished.

165
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
They say that’s mostly what depleted them.

166
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,500
They were extremely dirty.

167
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,00
After they were taken under the government, they say that were extremely dirty.

168
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And then they were depleted.

169
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:08,000
One day when they were depleted, I started traveling up there.

170
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,000
Also, I dropped out of school by my own choice when I was going to turn 15 years [old].

171
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:24,500
I started helping my father make money from the wilderness.

172
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,500
There were no jobs in the villages, only by [trading] fur.

173
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Villages didn’t have donated money, what they call grants.

174
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,500
People only got [money] mostly through [trading] fur.

175
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They also worked on lumber in the summer.

176
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
They worked hard to get money.

177
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,000
They would even carry loads of wood down from the trees.

178
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But my daddy traveled a lot.

179
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:11,000
We2 would go right after fishing in August up to the mountains to hunt for squirrels

180
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because squirrel skins were expensive.

181
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,000
Back when I first started, one coat cost $15.

182
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,500
But because we would be short [on money], we would go hunt squirrels.

183
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I see.

184
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And so to you, the young people these days

185
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Even outside of here, they’re starting to be mischievous even in other villages.

186
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes, the young people, our descendants,these days are becoming mischievous.

187
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And they have nothing to do at night, and tend to wander about.

188
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,000
They’re not like us.

189
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
In our time,

190
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:22,000
And when the child of this one who spoke before me enjoyed each others’ company, we went home early at nine [o’]clock and ten [o’]clock after playing.

191
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,000
These days you see, at night, and after midnight

192
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,500
Because they have vehicles, they’ve started going around with snow machines and even fourwheelers these days.

193
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Also, these young people, these little Yupiit

194
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Their mothers make the mistake of raising them without speaking [in our language] as we were.

195
00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:00,500
They learn, these children learn to speak English in school.

196
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Some days, here and over there outside of the school

197
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,500
I admonish these little Yupiit speaking in Yup’ik like this.

198
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Those big boys would answer me, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

199
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,500
It’s not right that we should lose, start to lose our language.

200
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And then sometimes, they would answer when I speak to them

201
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That that is not written in their high school books.

202
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,900
They’ve started converting to the Westerne ways in our region.

203
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,000
It’s probably because they always speak English to them.

204
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
They’ve also started losing their traveling ways.

205
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
They can’t walk a little ways over there either

206
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Saying that they don’t have that [vehicle].

207
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Back when we were boys, when the land [became walkable] like this

208
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Even though we had dogs, we left them behind and traveled with packs on our backs.

209
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,500
But we always had walking staffs as we were instructed.

210
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,900
We always had walking staffs even here in the village.

211
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Even when we walked through the village, we held a walking staff

212
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Because we were instructed to.

213
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:59,500
In Yup’ik instructions, Yupiit have a lot of instructions and traditional wisdom.

214
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:09,900
For you, what is the most powerful of those instructions

215
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Or the most important traditional wisdom of the people back then?

216
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:28,500
I just talked about the most important one: do not take other’s things. Do not steal.

217
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,000
That’s the most important because we all get disappointed from loss.

218
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's the most important.

219
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:42,000
Next, if we go anywhere, even inside the village, do not leave the walking staff.

220
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And if we should go on ice, we should [test it] with a pointed tool.

221
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Even in the village, make a long walking staff out of wood and hold it.

222
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,500
Even in the village, and even when we went up mountains

223
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,000
We always walked around holding a walking staff.

224
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,000
That's the next [piece of wisdom].

225
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,900
And sometimes, it would save us.

226
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,900
When we’re going to fall, we upheld ourselves with a staff.

227
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And sometimes, when we cross streams

228
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,500
That staff lets us know which parts are deep and should not be crossed.

229
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,000
We look for another path instead.

230
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,000
Even streams are dangerous up in the mountains.

231
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:48,000
The snow, as our ancestors back then used to say, if we travel without [?probing], we will fall into hollows in the snow.

232
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,000
Sometimes when we poke what looks good here, the [hollow] beneath does not close in.

234
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,000
They told us to always have staffs because we might fall into those

235
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,000
What they call neruinilluta.

236
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The area beneath, though this is all snow, the area beneath [?has a large hollow].

237
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,900
Because we might fall into those, they told us to always have a staff even in the village.

238
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,000
And when we’re going to cross, always examine it even if it’s narrow.

239
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Was there also…
