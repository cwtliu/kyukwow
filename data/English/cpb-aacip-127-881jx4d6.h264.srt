1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:07,320
And when we washed their clothes, our mothers would have us separate the men’s clothes

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,760
And they had us separate us women’s clothes, because they greatly respected them.

3
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:19,880
They used to do that because of the hunting that you just talked about.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,940
A woman’s clothes must be washed separately, only women’s clothes [together].

5
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:35,260
I also did that. I do it because I have many male children.

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:44,950
And, we don’t put the men’s clothes into that water used to wash the women’s clothes.

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,680
They would have to fill them with fresh water to wash the men’s clothes.

8
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:58,515
They would instruct us like this: not to take care of them altogether out of respect.

9
00:00:58,515 --> 00:01:03,310
One day, I asked, "Why do you have them [washed] like this?"

10
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,100
I used to ask my mother about what I didn’t know.

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,670
Then my mother said this to me:

12
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:21,400
She said, as you’ve been speaking about now, that they do that for their hunting, so that they will be good at catching animals in the wilderness.

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,220
I’ve said what I wanted to say about what I understood since we’re almost out of time.

14
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:39,150
Then we women who took care of food would treat what the men obtained with respect.

15
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,950
Whether fur-bearing animals, no matter what they we were, we took care of what men obtained with respect.

16
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:51,175
We tried to practice that instruction.

17
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,090
We didn’t make a mess of them.

18
00:01:55,095 --> 00:02:05,185
We didn’t make a mess of the bones, the craps, and the guts of what they caught as we took care of them.

19
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:13,585
I would ask my mother about everything, because I was my mother’s only child.

20
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:18,540
Since I didn’t have a lot of relatives, I would ask about them.

21
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,860
Then she would say this to me:

22
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:30,355
She said that if I make a mess of what my spouse caught too much

23
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:35,345
She said he will become unlucky in hunt, and won’t be able to catch anything in the wilderness anymore.

24
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:42,215
She said that will happen if I make a mess of them.

25
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:46,610
Animals he hunts will not give themselves.

26
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:54,440
And I believed them. I believed that happens to them.

27
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,100
I also just said

28
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:11,610
Since we women who subsist are not sedentary, since we try to gather from the wilderness, we also had practices.

29
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:22,140
Out of respect, we would be told not to go to a person’s place, a person’s gathering place.

30
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:30,090
Since it was that person’s gathering place, it required respect so as not to offend them.

31
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:38,180
We would only go to our spots, not in any random place.

32
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:45,310
I also used to hear people giving instruction

33
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:50,375
These men who hunt

34
00:03:51,190 --> 00:04:02,370
Things that will spoil, they do not put anything that will spoil there in the fish trapping spot, and drift netting spot.

35
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:20,145
They said that if a fish spoils in that drift netting spot, the fish will be low the next year.

36
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,290
There will not be that many [like the year before].

37
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:31,125
And that implement, the fish trap that is set there in a creek

38
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:36,335
They said the person who subsists in that creek reveres it.

39
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:41,305
He doesn’t want anything to spoil there because he subsists there.

40
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:49,425
They said that if an animal, or some other thing they caught, spoils around the fish trapping spot

41
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:55,495
The next year, it will not be as plentiful as it used to be.

42
00:04:55,495 --> 00:05:00,835
You see, we didn’t doubt those back then.

43
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:08,470
People back then respected everything, even the wilderness and even the land.

44
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:16,230
As I just said, before the land started looking unpleasant

45
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:23,465
Before it was covered with cardboard and empty cans, the land was pristine.

46
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:29,160
And the area far out around the villages would look good.

47
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:36,800
These days, you can tell every area that a person came across.

48
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:46,970
The place a person had come across, they would throw things, and there are their trash, what they used.

49
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,060
These days, the land has become like that.

50
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,550
It’s not pristine anymore, including the wilderness.

51
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,600
I think they don’t respect it anymore.

52
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,790
That’s all for that.

53
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,355
Okay.

54
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,440
She says that...

55
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:13,265
...plants, rivers, (And lakes), and lakes, those things.

56
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,600
We revered and respected them.

57
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:21,775
Yes.

58
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:35,185
Back then, here on the Yukon, here on the Kuskokwim, and likely on the Yukon

59
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:43,849
Yupiit have a traditional instruction to preside over this river with reverence.

60
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:56,056
They said that for us, in the spring or in the summer too

61
00:06:56,468 --> 00:07:13,118
We have an instruction from our ancestors back then that in the summer, we should never throw white-fronted geese from the summer of the previous year.

62
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:25,025
They said that when the food from the last summer are thrown there, fish won’t stay there.

63
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:36,013
Like those creeks that she just spoke of, that area will not have good fish populations.

64
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:43,326
But they said not to throw those things from the previous summer into that water.

65
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:50,358
They said we should dig and bury them in a pit there, and not have them be visible.

66
00:07:50,370 --> 00:08:04,358
But they said we can throw the guts and intestines of these fresh fish down [in the water], but where people will not trod.

67
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:14,383
They said to dump them in a deep area where people won’t trod, and where it doesn’t get exposed at low tide.

68
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:26,539
Now, they’ve started throwing things, turning the bank into fish [waste], because they don’t heed traditional instructions now.

69
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:38,033
That’s is how we should reverently treat the river, the huge river down there.

70
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,927
Okay, as far as the rivers in spring or summer

71
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,890
The rules of their forefathers were that they were told not to throw

72
00:08:50,909 --> 00:09:03,259
If there should be leftovers that can’t be eaten from the winter, that you do not throw these into the river.

73
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:09,228
If you do, there’s a chance that the new fish will not come to that river.

74
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:22,304
In case they might misunderstand that since they don’t know, and this person is from Fish and Game.

75
00:09:23,816 --> 00:09:27,491
We cannot throw food away.

76
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,572
And I haven’t heard of a Yup’ik person throwing [food] away to this day.

77
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:39,523
But the Caucasians among us throw food away. That’s all.

78
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:51,173
He didn’t want any misunderstanding of throwing away.

79
00:09:51,179 --> 00:10:01,629
He’s saying that the Native people as a whole are told that you don’t throw away food.

80
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:08,198
He just wanted to make that clear because he doesn’t [?] they do that.

81
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:24,830
But he has seen, you know, people, you know, who don’t have that kind of rule, throwing fish away, just the way they are.

82
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:33,486
If you treat something with respect, even if it’s food

83
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:44,655
How, you know, you used to cut them with as much respect as you had.

84
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:50,331
Or can that fish be cut in any way?

85
00:10:50,343 --> 00:11:00,793
We had admonishments concerning fish back then, and it probably also concerns marine animals down there.

86
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:11,887
We were told not to cut fish with axes, but to cut them with ulus if they’re thawed.

87
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:16,393
They said to only use those [ulus].

88
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:24,412
We were admonished against using axes on those fish

89
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:30,906
Unless they’re cold, and the dogs who’ve come on land are going to eat them.

90
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,331
They also admonished against using an axe on them in a river.

91
00:11:34,344 --> 00:11:45,344
They said not to use an axe to cut that fish that’s come up down there or in the Akula region. That was an admonishment.

92
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:54,526
That’s what that’s like, not to use an axe in the Akula region or here.

93
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:59,632
They didn’t like using axes [on fish].

94
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:11,332
Our caretakes said they [?inforn other animls], and that there are no more fish there when we are sloppy taking care of those fish.

95
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:14,857
Yeah, he has that answer.

96
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,770
Eliza, "piqertuaraqan [when he uses an axe]?"

97
00:12:18,777 --> 00:12:19,927
Axe.

98
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:22,009
Okay, okay.

99
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:30,196
There's a way that you cut rather than hitting motion like an axe or whatnot

100
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:33,902
Unless they're frozen and can't be taken any other way.

101
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:37,890
Then you show respect if it's thawed.

102
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:43,996
Dried fish, dried fish that we call neqerrluaraat

103
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:52,572
When we have leftovers, we give them to someone with dogs, a person with many dogs.

104
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:55,054
We give them as gifts.

105
00:12:55,073 --> 00:13:00,635
And he also wanted to say that if they have leftover, like with...

106
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:09,823
Various plants, and those berries

107
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:19,817
But we leave what we didn’t pick though there are a lot of berries, you know, what hasn’t been taken.

108
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:26,011
When they leave some, they will [return and] get the berries.

109
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:31,442
If one walked inland, they’d carry them on their back.

110
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:39,305
If one gets a lot, they will leave them there where they will not be tampered with

111
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:43,137
Then go and get those berries.

112
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:51,999
Or if a person has help, they will not leave any behind.

113
00:13:52,006 --> 00:14:04,506
Also, even if there are a lot of berries in the wilderness, they were told not to intentionally stop on these salmonberries [cloudberries] and crowberries.

114
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:07,813
Instead, step over them as if avoiding them.

115
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:12,782
Though one may try not to, we step on them when they’re too many.

116
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:19,526
Also, those plants that we eat

117
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:32,526
Sourdock, sourdock, and wild rhubarb, and berries among trees

118
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:42,376
You probably don’t know some of them, high-bush cranberries, red currants, black currants.

119
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:47,151
We also pick those berries from trees.

120
00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:50,839
However, some are admonished against.

121
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:56,795
You probably don’t know baneberries.

122
00:14:56,808 --> 00:15:02,933
This plant has many berries clinging to it, and is red.

123
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:05,564
They call those "crow’s food [baneberries]."

124
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,858
If we eat those, we will get sick.

125
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:23,239
Also, we are admonished against eateng that thing muskrats eat in the wilderness, what we call poison water hemlocks.

126
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:27,520
Those are deadly, poisonous.

127
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:37,046
Being careful with those, we should point out to our children that they’re bad.

128
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:43,696
We should also point out those plants that are edible.

129
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:50,684
Even those wild celeries that we eat

130
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:56,653
And how we eat greens, what they call spinich in English

131
00:15:56,665 --> 00:16:05,828
They have different ways of gathering from the land, including those fireweeds.

132
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,140
Also, when the leaves of these trees newly growing

133
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:17,009
Also eat those before they get hard.

134
00:16:17,016 --> 00:16:24,616
Pull those out with your hands and eat them, chew them immediately and eat them.

135
00:16:25,473 --> 00:16:29,623
Those are good when they’re newly grown.

136
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,417
Those are the plants we eat.

137
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,492
You probably know some plants.

138
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:41,455
You probably know some things.

139
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:48,574
I don’t know some of them.

140
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:57,718
What are the things they call water lilies in Yup’ik again?

141
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:03,218
I didn’t understand what you just said in English.

142
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:11,118
You know, those things with large leaves that float in lakes and oxbow lakes.

143
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:15,943
Those things? What do they call them again?

144
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:18,831
I know them. (Its name is obvious.)

145
00:17:19,062 --> 00:17:20,462
Might be paparnat.

146
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:21,381
Paparnat.

147
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:25,894
I don’t know how those are used.

148
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:27,776
I don’t know either.

149
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:32,382
I spoke of some of the plants that I remember.

150
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:35,457
Will you add to what he said?

151
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,683
Let me add a little.

152
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:37,708
Okay.

153
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:45,370
What [he said] just now are part of the plants in this paper

154
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:50,164
And these plants just spoke of, and these.

155
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:58,677
Something, they didn’t need an excessive amount, and we didn’t need to gather a lot in our time

156
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:08,446
What would be wasted, if it’s going to be wasted if it’s too much, some of what we obtained would be wasted.

157
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:20,203
They would only have us gather what was suitable for us, what wouldn’t be thrown away, and that we would finish.

158
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:24,703
It’s because people back then respected the wilderness

159
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:31,166
And they respected the areas where they subsisted as I just said.

160
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:39,785
They told us not to gather too much that would become surplus.

161
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:44,904
They said not to take what would become surplus.

162
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:50,230
It was like they feared the wilderness, though it was wilderness.

163
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:14,306
When I didn’t expect it, they told me over the phone to speak with you.

164
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:15,812
I see.

165
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:17,369
I’m happy now.

166
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:19,763
Okay.

167
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:28,538
Over there, Ayalpik told me when I went to go eat at Ayalpik’s

168
00:19:31,364 --> 00:19:41,126
They told me to speak to the students

169
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,689
But I didn’t speak to them.

170
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:53,045
I didn’t speak to them.

171
00:19:53,814 --> 00:19:59,627
This, no, don’t take it, it’s okay. It’s for the camera here.

172
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:07,352
Start by telling a story.

173
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:15,746
Now, I’m going to speak.

174
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:27,584
As they’ve asked me to, I’m going to tell a story of my earliest memories.

175
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,490
I’m going to tell them about my earliest memories.

176
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:42,572
I will also talk about their traditional instructions.

177
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:47,734
Young men, or girls...

178
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:49,253
Now go.

179
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:51,434
Now? (Yes.) Okay.

180
00:20:51,447 --> 00:21:05,660
Boys and girls, I want you to listen to our traditional instructions when we were small, and when I was a little boy.

181
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:15,435
They used to instruct us first and foremost to love.

182
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:23,422
Love is in the Bible as an instruction, that we should love one another.

183
00:21:23,728 --> 00:21:25,728
Look at that.

184
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:34,885
However, the women, old women, old men in my earliest memories

185
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:44,023
Without anything around them, and not knowing the Bible

186
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:55,904
Yet they instructed and admonished against everything that was written in the Bible.

187
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:04,435
This is the first, the first [instruction], to love one another

188
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:08,635
Something we should remember.

189
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:22,310
A boy or girl who stands with the traditional wisdom passed down to them does well, stands in the right.

190
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:35,235
However, one who forgets, doesn’t follow, or practice the traditional wisdom passed down to them

191
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:44,036
(S)he gets in to what they call [?bad spots].

192
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:51,673
Their peers, those around them, their fellow people criticize them.

193
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:59,779
They look at their [character] and criticize them.

194
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:07,780
And some don’t hold back with them.

195
00:23:09,124 --> 00:23:18,774
However, they don’t do that to an obedient person, and one who remembers their traditional wisdom.

196
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:24,568
There’s no one speaking unfavorably. There’s no one speaking unfavorably.

197
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:30,606
All of their fellow people treat them with compassion.

198
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:42,231
Now, these days

199
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:50,987
I don’t hear those pieces of traditional wisdom.

200
00:23:51,337 --> 00:24:06,862
But I’ve heard those pieces of traditional wisdom passed down to us through people speaking here on KYUK.

201
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:15,768
Though villages stay separate, they speak of one traditional wisdom

202
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:21,825
That we should love one another, to put love first.

203
00:24:21,825 --> 00:24:32,763
Their admonishment was that we should never take what’s not ours, what we call stealing.

204
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:36,488
They strongly admonished against that.

205
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:46,651
Then their instructions concerning these people whom they called decrepit.

206
00:24:46,664 --> 00:24:55,026
They would call those who are no longer active and healthy, decrepit.

207
00:24:57,302 --> 00:25:03,964
They were told to try to make them feel only gratitude.

208
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:13,952
They said to never make them feel offended or sad.

209
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:22,296
Instead, try to make them feel happy by duming their honey buckets, or hauling water.

210
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:26,715
Those were their traditional instructions.

211
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:32,677
What the meaning of that instruction? What meaning to they ascribe to it?

212
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:43,171
They said those who make others happy will stand for a long time.

213
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:47,777
He will live for another day for a long time.

214
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:56,796
That’s the outcome for one who practices making others happy.

215
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:04,778
They said he will stand for a long time, living to see another day.

216
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:09,103
That’s how they explained it.

217
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:15,903
They have a lot of traditional wisdom.

218
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:27,047
You see, they also used to speak in metaphors, using these things we know as metaphors.

219
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:38,528
One time in the summer

220
00:26:40,741 --> 00:26:51,866
We see fish appearing, and we don’t recognize them or know what they are though they appear.

221
00:26:51,885 --> 00:26:58,847
They would also use that as a metaphor, a parable.

222
00:27:02,198 --> 00:27:17,085
They say that one who offends those around them, or makes them sad, or makes fun of them

223
00:27:17,098 --> 00:27:21,910
The meaning [of that metaphor] is their lifespan.

224
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:30,923
The length of their life is not recognizable like the fish that appeared.

225
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:39,542
Oh my, how little is the length of that life.

226
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:48,055
The lifespan of one who disobeys wisdom is like the fish that appeared.

227
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:59,632
There's an accompanying one, wood.

228
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:09,014
Sometimes, there are good pieces of wood, with its surface looking good.

229
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:14,270
It's straight like this. It's good.

230
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:26,989
The inside of that piece of wood, however, is very twisted and can’t be split.

231
00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:39,765
Say that that jealous people who do not root for those around them are [like that].

232
00:28:39,997 --> 00:28:47,472
Jealous people who don’t root for those around them are like that.

233
00:28:47,916 --> 00:29:00,116
They only want those things for themselves, not for those around them.

234
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:10,010
They say that their mind, their mind inside is like the twisted piece of wood.

235
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:13,548
They don’t love those around them.

236
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:17,654
They’re like a twisted piece of wood.

237
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:28,048
They would instruct us through parables

238
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:40,405
Those things, those old men and old women [would teach us].

239
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:57,305
Also, the old women would refer to the girls who’ve had their first menstruations as young ladies.

240
00:29:57,324 --> 00:30:01,574
Those who haven’t menstruated yet were girls.

241
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:06,056
And these small [males] were called boys.

242
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:12,712
And they called one who was almost ready to take a wife, a young man.

243
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:17,350
They would instruct them.

244
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:26,687
They would instruct them on proper behavior, pointing out proper behavior.

245
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:40,831
One who remembers, those who remember, those who remember traditional wisdom live right.

246
00:30:41,018 --> 00:30:45,168
They [live] well.

247
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:54,024
They stand in the right, and those around them do not speak unfavorably of them.

248
00:30:54,030 --> 00:31:04,105
Those around them do not criticize them, those who practice traditional wisdom.

249
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:06,886
They’re like that.

250
00:31:07,024 --> 00:31:14,712
Please tell us about growing up in Eek, what they were like back then.

251
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:18,737
Why do they call Eek Ekvicuarmiut [People of the Small Cliffs]?

252
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:35,025
In my earliest memories, I found that Ekvicuarmiut, [formerly] Ekvicuaraat [Small Cliffs] downriver was wilderness.

253
00:31:35,582 --> 00:31:39,532
I started seeing them as a little boy.

254
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:45,739
It was a wilderness with no settlements, no people.

255
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:55,346
But were the Iinrayaq River across there goes out downriver to Eek

256
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:02,721
Iik has the same mouth as Iinrayaq across there.

257
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:12,421
Close to the mouth, well, at the mouth, there was a village with the name Akilirarmiut.

258
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:19,553
They called them Akulirarmiut.

259
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:31,853
When they relocated, they became Ekvicuarmiut, the village of Eek.

260
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:36,653
Ekvicuaraat downriver used to be wilderness.

261
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,988
And no one salvaged them.

262
00:32:40,007 --> 00:32:47,732
You see, the beginning of when they were established as a village was Uyaquq.

263
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:56,226
How was Eek established as a village?

264
00:32:56,239 --> 00:33:07,989
Like that, Uyaquq, where was he again? I think he was upriver.

265
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:22,883
Then they brought him downriver, since over there, there were, you know

266
00:33:23,665 --> 00:33:34,790
Since there were Moravian priests, they had him brought downriver to there.

267
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:41,071
He went to Akulirarmiut downriver.

268
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:50,547
Then when they arrived with him, they made him a house through the Ekvicuar village.

269
00:33:50,722 --> 00:34:00,822
Then Akulirarmiut relocated there and became Ekvicuarmiut.

270
00:34:04,229 --> 00:34:14,041
Only when Uyaquq went to them, they followed him to the Moravian church.

271
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:23,767
Though [the Moravians] would go to them, they wouldn’t comply [with the church].

272
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:30,667
Did you grow up when it became highly populated or when there was few people?

273
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:36,292
There were quite a few people.

274
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:40,324
In my earliest memories, there were pretty many people.

275
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:44,336
Villages would have a lot of people.

276
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:48,867
But they’re deserted now.

277
00:34:49,098 --> 00:34:53,773
And Qinarmiut here is now deserted.

278
00:34:54,704 --> 00:35:02,904
But Tuntutuliar downriver that didn’t use to be there are the only ones.

279
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:13,948
Also in Quinhagak, the first people who were at Quinhagak are gone.

280
00:35:13,954 --> 00:35:21,254
Only those who weren’t there and those who were boys live downriver in Quinhagak.

281
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:29,161
Some villages are now deserted there.

282
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:43,080
There also used to be the village of Apruka’armiut toward the water from Eek downriver, not far from the Kuskokwim.

283
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:49,467
They say it’s gone now. It’s already deserted.

284
00:35:53,148 --> 00:36:07,873
All of them, all the people who were in the villages in the past are decreasing, decreasing.

285
00:36:08,054 --> 00:36:11,179
Now there are only those who were young back then.

286
00:36:11,198 --> 00:36:22,185
Napaskiak downriver is only popuated downriver by those who were young back then.

287
00:36:22,198 --> 00:36:25,810
There are no more of those first people.

288
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:37,873
And downriver in Napakiak, there are no more of the first people.

289
00:36:39,311 --> 00:36:50,948
Only those who were young, only some of them were born way back then.

290
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:55,911
Some of them are from way back then.

291
00:36:56,593 --> 00:36:59,443
Those the same age as you?

292
00:36:59,462 --> 00:37:04,525
There are no more who are the same age as me.

293
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:14,500
Downriver in my village, there’s no one the same age as me. They’re all gone.

294
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,912
You’re the oldest?

295
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:25,568
Yes, I’m the only oldest one.

296
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:32,512
And my spouse went to the hospital over in Anchorage.

297
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:47,581
In your opinion, what has [helped] bring [us] to this day?

298
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:59,256
In my opinion, God has brought this day.

299
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:19,276
They say that God gives that person a certin number of days to live when they’re born.

300
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:30,116
Then that person stands [alive], then when they reach their time, they pass away.

301
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:34,077
That’s what would be in my mind.

302
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:42,561
When summer sets now, they start traveling by boat.

303
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:56,122
And a long time ago in the past to this day, we Yupiit have started using these life jackets of our [Western] counterparts.

304
00:38:57,254 --> 00:39:05,204
What can you instruct those going boating all summer that they should watch out for?

305
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:16,041
Now, they have floatation devices to keep a person afloat.

306
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:20,926
One should not be without those.

307
00:39:21,557 --> 00:39:26,707
And since they’re not heavy, they’re easy to travel with.

308
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:35,989
In the summer, now they always travel in the summer.

309
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:42,351
Back in the past, however, there were none of those life jackets.

310
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:48,695
And they wouldn’t travel by boat, but row kayaks.

311
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,008
That was their traveling device, the kayak.

312
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:57,996
Now, however, they have boats and boat motors.

313
00:39:58,008 --> 00:40:02,608
They have an easy time traveling.

314
00:40:02,627 --> 00:40:12,202
That’s why you should keep those life jackets.

315
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:23,146
Now, we know, we now know that a person’s potential misfortune is right in front of them.

316
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:37,983
You know, after someone is happy, and bursts out laughing, then when they leave their peers, they disappear.

317
00:40:37,984 --> 00:40:39,646
You see?

318
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:48,147
A person’s potential for misfortune is always present. It’s right in front of them.

319
00:40:48,429 --> 00:41:03,004
That’s why you shouldn’t forsake these instructions about these Western things.

320
00:41:03,023 --> 00:41:12,060
And keep those life jackets with you. And they’re not heavy to keep with you.

321
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:19,823
And even when using them, they’re easy to use since they keep you afloat.

322
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:37,355
And traveling with boats now

323
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:42,887
We always hear about people drowning now.

324
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:48,212
Please speak about those.

325
00:41:49,531 --> 00:41:50,768
Okay.

326
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:59,581
Compare drowning when going fast and slow, which has more drowning incidents, and why.

327
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:06,513
Now, please speak about that.

328
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:21,919
Back in that time, they traveled with kayaks.

329
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:34,938
Then when the wind picks up on them, they had light pullover garments made of bearded seal intestines

330
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:40,464
Seal gut pullovers that they put on.

331
00:42:40,464 --> 00:42:47,101
[Cover] the kayak cockput with that, you know how they’re round?

332
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:49,876
Did you used to see kayaks? (Yes.)

333
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:52,239
You know how they’re round?

334
00:42:52,258 --> 00:42:57,577
He would cover the kayak’s cockpit with his hem.

335
00:42:57,577 --> 00:43:06,064
Then they would bind it with a handmade rope of sealskin.

336
00:43:06,077 --> 00:43:08,002
They called that securing it with a rope.

337
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:16,233
Though waves do this to him, it cannot go in his kayak.

338
00:43:16,796 --> 00:43:20,821
That’s what they did.

339
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,990
Water cannot go in his kayak because it’s in his hem.

340
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:36,409
Then these boats haven’t sunk.

341
00:43:36,434 --> 00:43:48,084
But this thing they abuse, what they try to abuse brings them to misfortune.

342
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:54,341
What’s called alcohol is the cause of their misfortune.

343
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,623
When that didn’t exist, no one met with misfortune.

344
00:43:59,623 --> 00:44:07,485
We didn’t hear of anyone getting into misfortune in the summer, anyone drowning.

345
00:44:07,486 --> 00:44:19,248
Now, every person of the villages don’t want their youth to abuse this.

346
00:44:19,749 --> 00:44:23,136
Even those who aren’t young abuse it.

347
00:44:23,149 --> 00:44:29,286
It’s like it scatters them [their lives] like this.

348
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:34,911
That’s how I compare it, like scattering them [their lives].

349
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:45,249
You know, when we scatter things, they scatter, and what we call saltshakers scatter [salt].

350
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:59,143
It truly seems when I ponder that what they abuse makes their [lives] scatter.

351
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:04,543
People back then didn’t know of any [misfortune] when that didn’t exist.

352
00:45:04,543 --> 00:45:10,530
When that didn’t exist, they wouldn’t come to misfortune.

353
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:20,743
And their means of travel back then weren’t big like that. Kayaks were their only means of travel.

354
00:45:22,062 --> 00:45:32,862
This one too: now, we always hear that traditional wisdom is not heard anymore.

355
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:39,806
In your observation, why don’t our elders speak about traditional wisdom too much anymore?

356
00:45:39,806 --> 00:45:52,619
It’s because the people back then, there are no more of our elders.

357
00:45:52,631 --> 00:46:06,644
Because traditional wisdom had no more of our elders to speak of them, there is no one who speaks of them.

358
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:13,981
Some of them probably know about them.

359
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:21,688
They probably hear of the ancient traditional wisdom.

360
00:46:21,688 --> 00:46:28,138
It’s because no one speaks about it anymore.

361
00:46:28,145 --> 00:46:37,957
Look, the people I was born in time to see

362
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:47,820
They would speak of their instruction without changing it, where one was one and the same [every time].

363
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:52,502
When this person gave instruction, (s)he would speak of it.

364
00:46:52,502 --> 00:46:58,439
Before long, when another gave instruction, (s)he would speak of it.

365
00:46:58,452 --> 00:47:08,602
Because they don’t have those who’ve become elders to speak of them anymore

366
00:47:08,621 --> 00:47:20,409
They don’t speak about this traditional wisdom because those who spoke of them are almost gone.

367
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:28,784
Our elders always give instruction like this.

368
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:41,303
They give instruction. It seems they place [the blame] on young people, saying that we do not heed advice anymore.

369
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:47,366
Why is it like that now?

370
00:47:47,385 --> 00:47:55,785
Now, you see, we’re doing what they spoke of.

371
00:47:56,104 --> 00:47:59,892
We’re doing what they spoke of.

372
00:48:01,342 --> 00:48:06,855
The one is given instruction, (s)he cannot practice it.

373
00:48:08,442 --> 00:48:14,942
After one listens, they go and leave it behind.

374
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:26,724
Some of them would speak with that in mind.

375
00:48:26,749 --> 00:48:29,562
This is what they spoke of.

376
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:36,818
I also used to hear that people would stop practicing traditional wisdom.

377
00:48:36,818 --> 00:48:47,943
I used to hear way back in the past that when they have no more instructors that they will stop practicing traditional wisdom.

378
00:48:50,612 --> 00:48:58,387
Now, do you think that what you heard about people not practicing traditional wisdom has come true?

379
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:03,618
Yes, yes, it’s come true now.

380
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:15,025
You see, it was like people back then knew the far off future.

381
00:49:15,025 --> 00:49:17,587
It’s like they knew.

382
00:49:23,888 --> 00:49:40,000
Something that you want to leave with us, what kind of instruction would you leave with us young people or those of us who are listening?

383
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:40,951
Yes.

384
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,033
What would you leave with us?

385
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:48,527
I leave with you what I want to leave with you.

386
00:49:48,527 --> 00:50:00,152
Now, love each other, young people, love each other. Do not offend those around you.

387
00:50:00,183 --> 00:50:05,933
Be like a family.

388
00:50:05,965 --> 00:50:21,065
Now, you see, one easily goes the wrong way when [disobeying] traditional wisdom, or starting from being offended.

389
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:28,859
[Men and woman] the same way, even women have become like that.

390
00:50:28,865 --> 00:50:40,815
They go the wrong way when they are offended, go wrong because of that.

391
00:50:41,934 --> 00:50:57,584
But like this, you see, if you do not try to offend those around you, your fellow youth, or even if they’re old men or old women

392
00:50:57,603 --> 00:51:05,278
So it’ll be like you’re in a safe shelter.

393
00:51:05,297 --> 00:51:14,184
Remember this even when I’m gone.

394
00:51:14,222 --> 00:51:19,684
Yes, thank you. Thank you for telling us stories.

395
00:51:20,797 --> 00:51:22,197
You’re welcome.
