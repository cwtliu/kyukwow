1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,390
Yes.

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,550
Okay.

3
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:16,905
Ready? Okay.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,090
Imguuq, Martha H. Jackson, Kwethluk.

5
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:25,685
Even though I’m not originally from there.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,930
Where are you originally from?

7
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,100
I was born in Tuluksak.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
I see.

9
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:49,175
So, were you born in time to see the people of old who lived in community houses?

10
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,500
I was born in time to see them but just barely.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,450
I see.

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,360
I just barely born in time.

13
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:04,875
I was born in time to see their practices.

14
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:16,000
And people had their own separate bowls made of hollowed out wood like this.

15
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,890
We all had our own separate bowls.

16
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:33,235
I would think afterwards, "Even though they didn’t know about doctors, they didn’t share bowls."

17
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:41,265
After my stroke, the left side of my tongue is paralyzed.

18
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:44,155
I see. It’s okay. I can understand you.

19
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:47,395
Probably. I may be understandable.

20
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:49,695
Yes, it’s good. It’s good.

21
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:57,855
So, some of the traditional wisdom our people had

22
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:09,410
Now, we want to hear about them in case they help these young people.

23
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,020
Would you like to say any piece of traditional wisdom?

24
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:27,590
I would like to say something, but I wasn’t observant when I was young.

25
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:40,025
I would wake up to someone speaking because I would not move but stay still and listen.

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,860
I would listen to them as they were speaking.

27
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:50,975
These various things:

28
00:02:51,005 --> 00:03:03,355
Stealing, and a woman who does not listen to teaching, also because women were separate, different from the men

29
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:12,285
A woman instead does what she traditionally does.

30
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:32,136
And they would say this to us: "We always hear about traditional wisdome every day, and during the evening."

31
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:40,272
They would also tell us about instructions on how to be.

32
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:52,319
Because these poor descendats of ours probably are not taught by their mothers

33
00:03:54,404 --> 00:04:00,792
They do unacceptable things, and they also have children out of wedlock.

34
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:06,672
And two of my grandchildren have illegitimate children.

35
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:18,153
I think that it’s because I hold down my tongue and do not speak to them

36
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:27,306
Because they speak English, not Yup’ik like us.

37
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:40,674
The wisdom surrounding women, they would also tell us women this:

38
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:52,093
"Look, dear one, you’ve grown this much. When you see a boy, your lips rise."

39
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:58,056
They said that she would give the boy a big smile.

40
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:10,058
I would fear that. They would do this when they passed each other: "That one doesn’t smile."

41
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:18,913
They would say this to me because it was scary.

42
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,837
There is actually a multitude of traditional wisdom.

43
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:35,245
But because we’ve forgotten them doing that, we don’t bring them up with these young people, also thinking they won’t believe them.

44
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:49,412
Since they are educated in English, we don’t think they will believe the traditional Yup’ik wisdom that I remember.

45
00:05:55,888 --> 00:06:05,377
To them, my goodness, it’s embarrassing when they have children out of wedlock

46
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,590
What kind of face we should put on.

47
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:27,177
And when we’re going to pass these boys and the wind is blowing from their side, we would think this:

48
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:32,057
"I which way I should pass him?"

49
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:46,954
I would pass him on the downwind side, remembering the traditional wisdom passed down to me.

50
00:06:48,149 --> 00:07:00,229
They had traditional wisdom for everything including stealing, and taking something from another person and eating it.

51
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,724
That said that we were stealing.

52
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:08,294
It is dangerous.

53
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:21,360
May he hear of it somehow.

54
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:33,345
Some of the young people here and the boys who drink become different.

55
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,780
They tend to steal.

56
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:43,925
That is the first reason that they tell us.

57
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:58,960
They would tell us, but we would forget it then remember it.

58
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,180
It would come up in our minds.

59
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,340
That’s all, right?

60
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:11,345
Yes.

61
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:23,250
Is our Yup’ik language, the way we are speaking in Yup’ik now

62
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:29,785
Should we not lose it today, and why?

63
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:42,475
I don’t know. Some of them are also amazed as if hearing it for the first time.

64
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,185
They watch us.

65
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,910
The instructors would like it when we did that.

66
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:01,350
And watch him without looking away from his mouth. They said to try to [set it] into our hearts.

67
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:12,210
Oh pity me, I am not a good person, and my children do not listen to instruction.

68
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:19,585
It’s unfortunate that the admonishments we speak of seem to be for naught.

69
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:28,490
The admonishments that we feared seem to be of no importance to them.

70
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:37,575
But this, among the traditional wisdom passed down to them

71
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,140
If one keeps the traditional wisdom with him and goes forth with it, he will do well.

72
00:09:49,425 --> 00:10:01,975
Because I have a paralyzed side of my tongue, it keeps me from speaking well.

73
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:08,035
It seems to affect me more like this, but I am understandable.

74
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:16,574
Then back when the churches first came here

75
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:23,970
And when people started hearing about the church’s Bible

76
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:34,357
They heard it and found that it was not too different from Yup’ik wisdom. (Yes.)

77
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,123
Is that true?

78
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:43,721
It’s true. It is true, but it’s unfortunate that we do not adhere to them

79
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:52,284
Because we don’t adhere to them, and we do not teach them to our children.

80
00:10:54,338 --> 00:11:01,710
Some of them... I am grateful. I am grateful for Lagilek over there.

81
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:09,091
For Carrie.

82
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:17,125
She would adhere to the traditional wisdom passed down to her long ago.

83
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:24,050
I would think, "Wasn’t she inattentive when being taught?"

84
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:31,906
It’s because some people keep them in their hearts.

85
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:40,852
They would tell us that it is true.

86
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,428
Are there few great hunters these days?

87
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:56,859
It’s unfortunate that these people don’t know anything about being great hunters.

88
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:04,847
And when we’re going to encounter those who pass by, they would look down and pass by us.

89
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:21,766
This is part of what I just said.

90
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:36,081
Did people have ancient social interactions since ancient times?

91
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:47,956
They seemed to have social interactions. And when a guest came, they would always invite him to eat when I had moved here to Kwethluk.

92
00:12:48,578 --> 00:13:02,328
I remember what my late older sister Qaltayak used to do

93
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:21,954
They would probably also talk about how hard it is for guests to go to villages where they don’t know anyone.

94
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:29,632
They would also probably tell them to be sociable with guests.

95
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,888
That’s what they would tell us.

96
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:40,232
They say that an unsociable person has no close friends. He has no relatives.

97
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:56,532
However, a person who is spoken to or given a small admonishment seems to respond affectionately, as if he were treated with affection.

98
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:08,087
Even a little admonishment such as "Don’t do that" is enough.

99
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:21,221
To you, have the young people these days become mischievous?

100
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:26,988
It seems they now lack common sense.

101
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:33,176
They only seem to think about what kind of fun they can have.

102
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:39,321
In contrast, they would be respectful to people before.

103
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:46,254
When a person was traveling with a sled and found something, he would put it in.

104
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:54,043
When he returned and was finished eating, he would take that thing and go out.

105
00:14:54,354 --> 00:15:01,843
It turned out that he would show it to people without stealing it.

106
00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:09,432
When he had found the owner, he would give back what was lost.

107
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:16,955
Now, I would hear that people have things that were lost.

108
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:30,587
The traditional wisdom passed down to us comes up in my mind. It turns out that we who have become old women like this remember them.

109
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:36,499
When one’s mischievous phase has passed.

110
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:50,088
The poor peolpe back then probably lived difficult lives.

111
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:55,932
They lived extremely hard lives, and we felt the need to respect them.

112
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:06,944
And out of embarrassment, we would obey right away, adhere to their admonishments, and obey right away.

113
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:12,654
We wouldn’t want to be bad like that.

114
00:16:19,943 --> 00:16:29,498
What about now, wouldn’t girls have admonishments surrounding boys?

115
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,654
Yes, they had admonishments.

116
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:41,010
And they would make that man do things only husbands do if a woman makes love to him.

117
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:45,477
It was so scary it made our hearts skip a beat.

118
00:16:52,513 --> 00:17:10,256
And some of them say this: back then, they would only very rarely hear about people taking their only lives, young people killing themselves.

119
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:15,443
They said that they would only very rarely hear about them.

120
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:21,510
Is that something unfortunate to you concerning our young people?

121
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,344
It’s not an accident, but something admonished against.

122
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:34,933
Someday in the last day, they will appear.

123
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:43,065
That’s what they did.

124
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:57,432
They tell them not to do that. And our life as we breath, try not to destroy our life.

125
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,121
They would tell us to keep moving forward.

126
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:05,388
After struggling, they pass. It turned out to be true.

127
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:10,154
I’ve started experiencing it now since I’m not young anymore.

128
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:20,055
Try not to destroy your life.

129
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:26,410
Instead, try to move forward with what is right.

130
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,954
I have a lot of spittle.

131
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:42,266
Oh, I thought I saw... do you have any questions that you want to think of?

132
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:45,577
One other.

133
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:55,699
Is this Yup’ik language, you know... maybe I asked already.

134
00:18:57,121 --> 00:19:03,021
The Yup'ik language, you know how we're speaking in Yup'ik now?

135
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:14,010
Do you want to keep the young people from forgetting it? And why don't you want our Yup'ik language to be forgotten?

136
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:25,343
Well, they tell us to be still and observe. And they would also say that when they talk to us about this langauge.

137
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:36,744
We must only pray for God to help us.

138
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:51,221
Becoming like this, people apparently become unable like this. My arm also deters me.

139
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:58,854
I feel helpless.

140
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:07,755
When my daughter over there travels anywhere, I feel extremely helpless.

141
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:18,210
Yet I scold her and shout at her for not listening to me.

142
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:29,887
My grandmother would also speak to me like this as if she were shouting at me.

143
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:39,688
Is there a meaning behind an elder speaking to a young person as if shouting?

144
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,932
They would tell them not to look away from the person’s mouth who’s speaking of good things.

145
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:53,310
They said it was so that it could be stored in the heart.

146
00:20:55,633 --> 00:21:03,644
If he’s going to do something, he will remember that admonishment.

147
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,154
He would end up not doing it.

148
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:24,799
Do you want to say anything that you want the young people of the Yukon and the Kuskokwim here to hear?

149
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:39,065
Oh my, I am not disinclined. I can’t see papers either. My eyes have gone bad.

150
00:21:39,943 --> 00:21:45,377
They can’t see anymore. And with writing, the paper looks white.

151
