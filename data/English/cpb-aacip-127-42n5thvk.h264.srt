1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,000
...when they’re green, freshly grown.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,830
After putting them into a bowl, pour seal oil onto them, add in dried pike, then eat them.

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,340
They are very good.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:27,250
She said that she used to use those things to eat [?], and they mixed them with seal oil.

5
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,429
And then they also...

6
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:34,716
They were healers.

7
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,946
Because I’ve never gone to shamans, I don’t know about them.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,800
They said that shamans... I don’t know them because I didn’t see shamans around.

9
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:52,130
I’m not telling them about what I don’t know, but only what I do know.

10
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:58,011
I say I don’t know what I don’t know. I don’t know how shamans work.

11
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:08,543
She said she didn’t go to any shamans, so therefore she can’t tell you.

12
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:13,271
And she can’t really talk about something she doesn’t know.

13
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:16,791
I used to hear about urine.

14
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:32,911
To someone on the verge of freezing, someone who is very cold in the wilderness on the verge of freezing, on the verge of freezing with his whole body cold

15
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:41,692
I heard that the person who found him would immediately have him drink his urine.

16
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:45,668
His urine?

17
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:53,007
The person that came would give his urine for the one on the verge of freezing to drink.

18
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:06,216
She said that the one example that she knows is when urine was used

19
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:15,605
Was when a person almost freezes or goes through hypothermia, when the body is already cool

20
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:27,279
She said the person who rescues that person or comes up to them would pee and let that person drink that urine.

21
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:34,276
Nass’, I heard that for the...

22
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:45,267
I heard that he gives him his warmth, that person who is well would help him by giving him his warmth.

23
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:50,948
She said that it was usually the one who...

24
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:54,908
...through that urine, the warmth, let it go through their body.

25
00:02:56,527 --> 00:03:00,805
Back then, urine was also used medicinally.

26
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:15,998
Urine in those days was also treated as medicine.

27
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:18,937
How would they use it?

28
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:26,066
Now, you see these days that there are not a lot who do that.

29
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:36,377
But since people are cleaner, they have stopped breaking out with sores that they would call impetigo.

30
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,136
People are cleaner these days.

31
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:48,622
The germs from dirt can no longer penetrate the body and cause it to break out because they consistently wash.

32
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:54,343
Back when they didn’t consistently wash, urine was used medicinally.

33
00:03:55,238 --> 00:04:03,327
Some children’s, and even some adults’ heads would break out with impetigo.

34
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:09,588
And some of their scalps would get hardened crusts from those stores.

35
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:13,960
But urine would make them better.

36
00:04:14,944 --> 00:04:24,899
After soaking them in seal oil to soften them, you know how the discharge from inside those sores would harden

37
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,670
After soaking that in seal oil to soften it, then when it softened

38
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:45,632
Finally, they would use aged urine, not fresh, that has become potent to wash their heads.

39
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:59,516
And after washing them, they would warm up less potent urine and was their heads again, taking off the scabs.

40
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:07,835
And then after removing them, they would apply a little seal oil to keep them from drying out.

41
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:14,401
They said that those washed with urine would not break out again for a long time.

42
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:22,364
Go ahead and translate it now. You’ll forget what it’s about.

43
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:27,326
[?] Let me mention something about what I know.

44
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:28,614
Affter translating this.

45
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:30,654
After translating it.

46
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:40,817
She says the other use for urine was, she said you see nowadays that nobody uses urine...

47
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:42,750
Yes.

48
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:48,725
Those willows are native to the Akula region.

49
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:57,921
Then out here on the Kuskokwim, the big trees on the Kuskokwim have completely different names.

50
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:06,219
(Yes.) You know some of the willow shoots (Yes.) [?] you know their insides are delicious. (Yes.)

51
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:13,370
And do they add their branches into soups?

52
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:16,977
You know we add them in the summer? (I never have before.)

53
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:21,447
We add them in the summer before they harden.

54
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:22,833
Did you mention them?

55
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:24,926
I didn’t mention them.

56
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,834
Because you’re talking about trees.

57
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:36,998
Then two weeks ago, I’ve never gathered them before, I went to Anchorage and my daughter said this to me:

58
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:42,302
”Mom, why don’t you make food out of trees?"

59
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:44,760
"Out of what?"

60
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:48,808
"And why don’t you make food from the leaves of willow shoots?"

61
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,906
I said to her, "I don’t know them."

62
00:06:51,302 --> 00:07:06,324
And then my daughter told me that her friend fed her the leaves of willow shoots in seal oil from Unalakleet.

63
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:09,792
She said they were very good.

64
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:17,712
And then I said, "Wow, there’s so many willow shoots on the Kuskokwim."

65
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:31,300
Now, I’m preparing to put willow shoots in a jar with seal oil when summer sets. My daughter really wants me to.

66
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:35,252
It turns out we don’t know what we can eat.

67
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:41,066
I just talked about what food we can prepare.

68
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:52,104
This is Elena Nick and their cousins. She says, you know, there’s so many different...

69
00:07:55,767 --> 00:08:07,633
They take care of frostbites by trying to thaw them out. Frostbites don’t thaw right away.

70
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,725
They would take care of them by trying to thaw them.

71
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:20,589
How exactly would they do that?

72
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:27,109
Leave me and don’t ask me about that. I don’t like it.

73
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:36,812
Her husband got really frostbitten. He almost died. She doesn’t want to talk about it.

74
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:39,587
That reminds her of...

75
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:44,917
[?] there is treatment for frostbite.

76
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:55,067
Well, they, when I was younger, we used to have frostbites on our cheeks when we played too long outside.

77
00:08:55,377 --> 00:09:05,767
And then the old people would let us put a little bit snow on the frozen part for a while and then let it go.

78
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:14,042
And stay in the hosue and try to thaw it out with our hands, not by the stove.

79
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:24,052
Because they say when you put something warm on it, the cold part will go inside, and that’ll rot the skin.

80
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:28,342
So, that was the only thing we knew.

81
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:38,832
Do you know how the snow is supposed to help them...

82
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:43,637
I don’t know. They said it’s supposed to bring out the frozen part...

83
00:09:58,262 --> 00:10:02,782
We can go into another break, fast ten minute break.

84
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,287
Today, they...

85
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:14,217
I apologize. (It’s okay.)

86
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:17,927
You can go to the bathroom. (Okay.) Okay.

87
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:47,627
My husband went out looking for that boy that was missing since Saturday, George Guest Jr., I mean, George Guest.

88
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:59,552
He was gone since Saturday, and then my husband went out looking for his three-wheeler yesterday by plane.

89
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:04,227
And then he found a three-wheeler somewhere between here and Atmauthluk.

90
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:07,832
Then they started looking for him.

91
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:16,322
Every time when George landed, he was right there. He takes off, he didn’t see him, he was right there, close to the three-wheeler.

92
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:25,012
They found him this morning. And they went out, and George brought him in, and he’s not supposed to carry passengers.

93
00:11:28,217 --> 00:11:29,877
He could hardly move.

94
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:31,842
Poor thing. He’s still alive?

95
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:33,632
He was still alive.

96
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:35,412
[?] to Anchorage?

97
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,347
I don’t know.

98
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:40,517
He said she was still there, his mom and his sister were there.

99
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,817
Ran out of gas or something?

100
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:45,784
Something wrong with his three-wheeler.

101
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:51,319
He was gone since Saturday. Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.

102
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,319
Three days? (Poor thing.)

103
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:38,267
Those tall cottongrass, you know that we eat the insides of tall cottongrass? We split them and eat what’s inside.

104
00:15:38,293 --> 00:15:47,448
Cloudberries would be contained in woven bags out of those, big woven bags. They were big like this.

105
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:57,253
After she picked berries in the summer, my late mother would put them into one of those.

106
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:06,679
Then she would make a deep pit, digging into the tundra all the way to the permafrost below.

107
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:11,739
And after digging it, it would get filled with water.

108
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:19,369
And when it was filled, that woven grass container filled with cloudberries

109
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:31,525
They would weave tall cottongrass into containers with gaps of a certain size circling them around like this, weaving them into circular patterns like this.

110
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:34,660
And then closing off the bottom.

111
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:41,474
They were like those sewn things you call baskets.

112
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,747
But they had wide gaps.

113
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:49,943
And then they would fill that with berries.

114
00:16:49,949 --> 00:17:01,289
After filling it full, they would tie it there, then weave a cord into by weaving grass.

115
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:05,711
They closed the rim off tightly.

116
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:16,251
And then after doing that, she would put it into the pit she dug filled with water.

117
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:22,550
Then after putting it in, she would line the sides with trees, then close off the mouth with dirt.

118
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:25,764
It would stay there all summer.

119
00:17:27,365 --> 00:17:32,876
And then in the fall as it was going to freeze close to winter, she would take it out.

120
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:38,160
Before it froze and got stuck, she would take it out.

121
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:46,678
She would take them out and they were very good. They were like freshly picked berries in that woven grass container.

122
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,744
They were very good.

123
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:58,918
And the other ones, the sourdock, you know those green sourdock.

124
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:09,323
She boiled them, and when they were cooked, she would ladle them out, cool them off, and put them into a woven grass container.

125
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:20,261
The same way, she would bury them into a put like that so that they would be submerged.

126
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:30,504
And she left them. Then it froze, and as they were going to get stuck, she would take it out like that cloudberry container.

127
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:35,226
She kept them cool, kept them frozen.

128
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:39,729
That’s what they did to their winter food supply.

129
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:43,830
Would you make a sourdock-berry mixture here?

130
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:48,754
Would you make sourdock-berry mixtures?

131
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,534
Would you add blueberries to the sourdock?

132
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:56,376
We didn’t do that.

133
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:59,734
They would make sourdock-berry mixtures up north.

134
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,597
They cook the sourdock.

135
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:14,509
After they’re cooked, they mix blueberries with it, and then let it [?] she described in the ground.

136
00:19:14,564 --> 00:19:24,697
And when it’s cooled off in the fall time [?]. And that’s another way of preserving the blueberries because the blueberries are harder to keep than the salmonberries.

137
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,974
So are you going to translate that?

138
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:35,468
She was talking about her mother that...

139
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:36,502
What?

140
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:39,779
The seal blood...

141
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,831
Tell him I don’t live where there’s seals. I live here. Tell him I don’t know about seals.

142
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:52,043
But the coastal people, tell him to ask the two old men that joined us this morning.

143
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:55,544
Tell him they’re coastal people.

144
00:19:56,136 --> 00:19:59,925
Please tell them. Tell them over there.

145
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:08,005
We’re not from the place where there’s lots of seals or those things.
