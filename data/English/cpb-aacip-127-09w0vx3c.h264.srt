1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Is it going?

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,500
Now, please say your name in English and in Yup’ik.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My name is Martha Sarah, and I’m Uliggaq in Yup’ik.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,500
How old are you?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Seventy-nine.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Please talk about your children, grandchildren, and if you have any great-grandchildren.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have four children, and 17 grandchildren, [and] 11 great-grandchildren.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,000
First of all, February is nearing its end now

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,900
How did they prepare to go to their spring camps back then?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When they were going to go to spring camps, they would start preparing in April.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,000
They also prepared their food supplies for the spring ahead of time.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,000
And they went to go set their tents.

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,000
And… I’ll slip into English, you see.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And, you know, they would bring their boats and canoes.

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
They would bring what they would need to their spring camps.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And then after the middle of April, we would move.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We would arrive to our settlements.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It was very nice and wonderful.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Have you heard about how they gauged whether it would flood?

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,500
The people back then would look at the snow when there was a lot.

21
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,800
And the ice when there was a lot.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,800
When it was a little frozen between the snow

23
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,800
There were repeated warm periods.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They said that when there was lot of snow, and a lot of snow upriver from us, there is a lot of water.

25
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,900
They would say that there was a lot of water.

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,000
Did you see the snowiest time?

27
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,500
There was a lot of snow back when we were small; there used to be so much snow.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,500
And those mission houses down there were the only ones most elevated.

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,000
[The snow] would reach their roofs [sloping] down.

30
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,000
We would go up there and slide.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And when the entrance porches were shoveled, it would be like an animal den to the doors.

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,900
Were they wary of floods when that happened?

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes, they would be worried that it would flood.

34
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:54,500
But sometimes when it melted slowly, they said that the water went away.

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,500
It probably evaporated and drained.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There wouldn’t be a lot of water when it [melted] slowly.

37
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,000
Then how did women prepare to go to spring camp?

38
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:16,000
Women back then prepared by making waterproof skin boots, putting soles on waterproof boots

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Also because they didn’t use shoe packs.

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
They made waterproof boots out of various things.

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,300
They made waterproof footwear for the men when they were going to move.

42
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,500
And even the women wore waterproof skin boots.

43
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,700
It was because the women back then used to sew to prepare what they would need.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They weren’t like us; they weren’t lazy.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is the snow not like how it was back then?

46
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,000
It seems that now, [un]like back then

47
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:57,000
Well, when I first started school back then, there used to be a lot of snow.

48
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,000
Very big snow banks; it was quite wonderful.

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:10,500
We also dug tunnels, and made houses in big snow hills.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,500
Now, you see, that doesn’t happen anymore.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,500
It seems like there’s a lot of snow now, but it’s not like that.

52
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,400
The snow hasn’t reached the roofs either.

53
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,500
How far… and then after spring camp, would they go to their summer camps right away?

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:40,500
They would go back depending on how green the plants became in June.

55
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,800
They would go home when they became green in June.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,900
And sometimes, they would be weatherbound by the late melting of the ice

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Unable to travel by crossing rivers and oxbow lakes.

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,900
They only returned when it melted

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,800
And they would portage to the Kuskokwim.

60
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,000
And when the ice broke up on the Kuskokwim, it was noticable even in the Akula region.

61
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,900
It was audible when it happened.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
At this time of year, what did they do, including Yup’ik dance festivals?

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What did they call it? They said that they used to have the Sharing Festival [Avgarutaaryaraq].

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
After they held Yup’ik dance festivals, villages would invite others

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Villages downriver and upriver from Bethel would compete.

66
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,000
They called that Avgarutaarluteng.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Even if it was just the people from here, yes.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They would compete against each other, inviting the village at the end and [giving] them things.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They would bring various things to the community house, traps and all kinds of things.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Is there anything else to add?

71
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
That’s all they did in my presence.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
They would stop when they started moving.

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,500
It was fun watching them compete.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,800
The last ones to finish would win.

75
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,800
What kinds of contests did they have? How [did they go]?

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,700
The last one to invite like that, and they would bring things to the community house.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,500
And then their competitors over there would stop without reciprocating.

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,900
That [inviting] village would win.

79
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,900
Did they have prizes?

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No. No, they just… (They just had fun.)

81
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,000
They were fun.

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, that’s enough. (Yes.)

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Okay, like Martha just now, please say your name in English and Yup’ik.

84
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,500
Okay, they called me Kumangulria in Yup’ik, and Matthew in English.

85
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,500
Please talk about your children [and] grandchildren.

86
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,000
I have nine children of my own

87
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,500
And only six grandchildren, and no great-grandchildren.

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Where did you grow up? (Wait, wait.)

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ready?

90
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,500
Where did you grow up? [Please] talk about how you grew up.

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,600
I grew up on the Yukon [in Acacaryun]

92
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,500
But I went to school in Holy Cross back when I was small.

93
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:40,500
After I stayed for 11 years, qula ataucimek allrakunek, after going home I went again to Mt. Edgecumbe.

94
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,000
After I was there for ten years going to school

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,000
And after getting a job there, I came here to Bethel.

96
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,800
I moved and worked inland at the hospital.

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I worked for 17 years.

98
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,000
When I got tired of working at the hospital and moved to the BIA [school]

99
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,500
When they told me I couldn’t work anymore after working for six years

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The doctors had me quit working because I got an ailment in my midsection.

101
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
What did you see when you grew up on the Yukon?

102
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,500
Like, what did they do when [the season] became like this?

103
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:33,000
In the spring on the Yukon these days, various fish including these blackfish become scarce.

104
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,000
That’s why what you call Kanruyauciq [February] here is called Unguurvik [Time of Driving Game] up on the Yukon.

105
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:48,000
In this month back then, they only subsisted by driving hares.

106
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,400
Did you observe a lot of snow on the Yukon or somewhere else?

107
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Yes, there used to be a lot of snow back in the 1930s when I was a boy.

108
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:09,000
Sometimes when there was a lot of southern winds and snowing, they would say the the marsh cirmiggluni.

109
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,500
They said it froze.

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,500
Even though there’s a lot of snow now, the tundra here is not frozen.

111
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,400
Sometimes, though there’s a lot of snow like this, it doesn’t flood even with a lot of water.

112
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,000
But the ice [?melts in the region] late.

113
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,000
They say that it repeatedly freezes and depletes its [flood] water.

114
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,000
Only when it’s frozen and can’t do that, there is flooding.

115
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,500
Also, when these rivers have a lot of snow, the ice isn’t thick.

116
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Because it’s not as thick as it usually is even with a lot of water, I don’t think it’ll flood because of that.

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,200
Did the people back when it used to be extremely cold

118
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,900
You know that it’s not like now.

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Did you hear about people freezing to death?

120
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,800
We didn’t hear about anyone freezing to death because we had warm fur clothes.

121
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And even though it’s cold now, it doesn’t reach the cold it used to.

122
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,000
Because we don’t have appropriate clothes anymore now

123
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,000
When it’s a little chilly we like to say it’s cold.

124
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Did you used to hear about how they gauged whether it would flood or not?

125
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, I just told you about the marsh here…

126
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,400
What did they look at to find out?

127
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,000
Did they watch the area upriver or downriver?

128
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,400
Even though there’s a lot of snow like this now, it only gets foreseeable in the spring.

129
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,000
When it gets cold at night after being warm like this, they call that repeated freezing.

130
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,800
Until when would it be cold?

131
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,000
Sometimes when summer was late

132
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:10,000
When summer came late up on the Yukon, the ice melted on the 10th of February.

133
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:21,900
When that happened, summer started to set past the middle of May.

134
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I think it was about 1936.

135
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Now, Easter is also late. And now…

136
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Summer will set later than it usually does.

137
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,000
These days, they also use Easter to gauge the seasons.

138
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,400
When it’s later [than Easter], they would say summer will set late.

139
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,000
When it’s before Easter, they also say summer will set early.

140
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,400
So we don’t observe groundhogs?

141
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
We don’t know about those.

142
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:05,500
From what you saw growing up, what would they do this time of year? How would they do them?

143
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
They didn’t do too much back then.

144
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:14,000
I grew up mostly in the wilderness; we didn’t live in settlements.

145
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,000
We only tried to gather these various things.

146
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
And at that time, there was no fish in the Yukon.

147
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,000
My late father also told me back then

148
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,000
When he was a boy also, there was [a time of] no fish too.

149
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,500
When the Yukon has no fish, it apparently has no fish for four years.

150
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,000
The fish wouldn’t suddenly disappear; the fish declined every year.

151
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:51,000
When that happened at the time, because my earliest memories are when there was no fish

152
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,900
We stayed mostly in the wilderness, not in settlements

153
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,500
Including my blood siblings.

154
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,900
Our peers Yup’ik dance, but we siblings never Yup’ik danced.

155
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Neither did our mother and father Yup’ik dance.

156
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,000
But they didn’t explain why we didn’t do that.

157
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,800
How did youpl prepare to go to spring camps?

158
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Right after Easter back then, we would prepare by moving our boats, even setting up tents.

159
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,500
And fish traps, they [made] fish traps in the spring.

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What about the women?

161
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,900
And back then, women would make grass packs to store the meat they dried

162
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Because they dried blackfish, even pike, and dried these birds.

163
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,000
Those dried meats in the summer

164
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,300
Because fish might be our only food, they dried birds also because we didn’t have freezers here.

165
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,000
How did they use like freezers?

166
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:18,500
You know, my older brother made one out of the land by digging the side of a cliff.

167
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,400
In the winter, however, he would fill them with ice

168
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,800
Lining them with grass that he sawed there.

169
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
When the things that needed to be stored in the spring were stored there, they wouldn’t spoil too much.

170
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,500
But, that’s how they lived without freezers like we have here now.

171
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Have you ever seen an extreme flood that was very high?

172
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,000
That happened once.

173
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,500
Also, when I moved here, it was [over]full here once.

174
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,200
The bridges, qeraryarat, down and over there

175
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,000
It almost made the bridges on Kepenkuq float.

176
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:14,000
When it was going to flood like that here, we escaped to the Yukon because [Acacaryun] there is on the mountains.

177
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,500
When we went north, it turned out that all of the marsh here had water

178
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,000
Because the [ice] apparently choked downriver from Mountain Village.

179
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,800
Hills were the only land [above the water].

180
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,700
It seemed like the ocean around us.

181
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,900
When it started getting [over]full up north, we came toward here again when the tide was going out.

182
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,500
It was also extremely [over]full here.

183
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:50,000
Before they elevated these bridges and roads, it almost [flooded] over them when it was [over]full then.

184
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,000
I saw the Kuskokwim get that full.

185
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Also, I think it was in 1937 when the Yukson was [over]full too

186
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,500
And because we wouldn’t travel with planes through there, the marsh there was completely covered with water.

187
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,500
And when we went hunting for muskrats, because my older brother and I always went together then

188
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:26,500
When the water level was increasing, we went to our family whom we found because the land was completely covered with water.

189
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:36,000
But our ancestors would apparently have spring camps in places the land wouldn’t be covered [with water] even when it was [over]full.

190
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,500
Because they had known that since time immemorial

191
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
As they hunted in the aftermath of [the land] being covered

192
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:53,500
They established settlements like that because they might be in dire situations if the water reached them.

193
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Is that all? (Yes, thank you.)

194
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,000
What’s your age, date of birth?

195
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,000
I’ve turned 65. I’m going to be 66 this year.

196
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,000
I’m still a boy. (When? When?)

197
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
March 22nd.
