1
00:00:06,094 --> 00:00:12,805
[?] was saying [?]. You think it could be leukemia?

2
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:18,545
Or, she was [?] and her skin was really dark.

3
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:23,195
Was her blood bad?

4
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:29,048
Their ailment was in her blood, and it was bad.

5
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:31,589
It could be some other kind of sickness too.

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,986
We’re not enough of the story [?].

7
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:44,655
What about these, [?] is that, they call them chickweed that we have growing?

8
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:49,029
It’s what I was just trying to get, but we’d have to see that.

9
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:58,151
I have bag of them out in my office, but they’re from a Western store.

10
00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:03,145
But they really like those, those kind of flowers.

11
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:18,506
Yeah, but my friend got that tea for me, and looks really like that.

12
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:31,976
Those things, Lucy, since these can’t see those false chamomiles, though they hear the name, they don’t know exactly what it is.

13
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:33,618
Yes.

14
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:38,188
I think they were wondering...

15
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:43,379
Those false chamomiles grow in old settlements.

16
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,684
Yes, he over there knows them.

17
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:02,151
I’m not a good translator.

18
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,270
No, it’s not that. Did she get sick after taking medicine?

19
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:07,667
No, she...

20
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:12,760
She was already sick from something in her blood. There was some disease in her blood.

21
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:16,696
[?] six months to a year.

22
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:30,101
Her hair was coming out. Her skin was turning dark.

23
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:33,109
Does that ring a bell?

24
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:36,117
And that’s when she started that medicine.

25
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:40,070
How long ago was this?

26
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:46,745
How many years did that last?

27
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:48,569
Her sickness?

28
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,908
Yes, [since] when?

29
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:55,265
This past winter, and last year

30
00:02:55,267 --> 00:03:00,478
She’s good now. She’s gotten better now. She’s back to normal.

31
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,213
Just now?

32
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,380
Yes.

33
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:07,143
And what year [?].

34
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:13,162
The years now, she started here, you see.

35
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,826
She started this year, and now, she’s been good these two years.

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,740
Okay, must be ’81. (Three years.)

37
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:24,155
Probably. I don’t know those [years].

38
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,108
[?] daughter is healthy now?

39
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:34,390
Three years as compared ot six months that she was [?].

40
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:44,326
Who was that, and where did the doctor examine her?

41
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:52,667
Here. Yes, she has caretakers here, and she always used to go to Anchorage.

42
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:57,573
It’s because we want to find out what her sickness was.

43
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:58,603
Yes.

44
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:01,446
The doctors here...

45
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:09,371
She also has a doctor here inland. Her caretaker is inland at the hospital.

46
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:21,844
Half of it.

47
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:28,315
She said half of a berry [?].

48
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:32,707
Let’s take a break.

49
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,939
Let’s stop for a bit.

50
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,591
I have a headache.

51
00:04:53,284 --> 00:04:55,907
...when they do that, they stop bleeding.

52
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:04,946
She said if they got a deep cut, they usually put Tobasco on it.

53
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:09,418
People have slightly different saliva...

54
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,365
...they would do that to it.

55
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:13,740
I don’t know that.

56
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:15,188
She doesn’t know it.

57
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:16,943
Has anybody ever heard of that?

58
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:22,691
...if they’ve used anything other than [?] oil or something.

59
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:24,192
Other than oil?

60
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,478
I mean, what was used traditionally.

61
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:31,973
When they have earaches.

62
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:42,000
A long time ago, what remedy would they use for earaches?

63
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:50,450
I do that too now. When my children have earaches, I pour some oil and fill them inside.

64
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,439
Would they use anything else?

65
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,468
Oil, would they use anything else?

66
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:05,742
But I used to watch some of them

67
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:10,799
How many times have I watched it? It was dangerous.

68
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,200
They would roll up a piece of paper like this so that it had a sharp point.

69
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:23,240
After they rolled it to a sharp point, they’d put it here in the ear of the one with the earache.

70
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:31,070
Then they’d light a fire there. It would burn down and spark, then they’d get better.

71
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:35,740
So are these false chamomiles?

72
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:39,144
Those are absolutely false chamomiles.

73
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,399
See, those are false chamomiles.

74
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,944
What are they called?

75
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:58,500
Chamomiles. Chamomile.

76
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,242
What are they?

77
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:03,589
C-H-O-M-I-L-O-T?

78
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:19,737
They’re talking about how we would pour oil (Yes.), yes.

79
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:22,156
That one with an earache.

80
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,859
The top parts of false chamomile.

81
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:28,777
(S)he saw them.

82
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:39,147
And these, these too, the bark of the branches of these little trees.

83
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:48,156
Some of those children have sores on their mouths, the sores going from their throats inside going out to their mouths.

84
00:07:48,174 --> 00:07:55,808
Then their bark, not doing anything with them after removing their leaves, these kinds of trees here.

85
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,564
They wouldn’t use just any trees for medicine.

86
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:05,266
But it would be clear which ones, these ones that are [?].

87
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:16,011
You see, after ripping off the barks from these, when they put them on sores, huge sores with pus

88
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:19,434
They get wrinkly.

89
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:23,114
Do you know how this flesh gets wrinkly?

90
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:31,743
You know how when you wash clothes or deal with water for a while, the skin of the hands becomes abnormal?

91
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:39,426
That [happens] when these are in contact with sores.

92
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:46,404
For those with sore throats, and bad sores in their mouths, keep these in their mouth.

93
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:52,126
Because they taste so bad, the inside of the mouth becomes different.

94
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:54,390
Their bark is also medicinal.

95
00:08:54,405 --> 00:09:01,038
Though they grow out there, rip them off, and overlap the inner parts of their bark.

96
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:07,261
Open sores heal right away, not grow for long, sores.

97
00:09:07,805 --> 00:09:11,816
You know how some of children tend to get sores in their mouths?

98
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:15,285
Those are also medicinal.

99
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:24,087
Have them keep it in their mouths, but though they swallow their saliva, let them be, keeping their throats in mind.

100
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:27,443
That’s how we used these.

101
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:37,373
She was talking about these kinds of bushes.

102
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:47,324
They could use these like I said, take out the bark, and take off the black part from the outside, and use it.

103
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:53,079
How can you translate ”peqlirtellria [wrinkled skin]" into English?

104
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:56,831
I don’t know.You know how the flesh becomes different?

105
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:03,717
And something, you see, when you keep these in your mouth, your mouth becomes different, wrinkled.

106
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:19,059
Well, that’s when it’s sore inside, and it turns like that, I think. It gets wrinkled. Your mouth is sore on the inside, and it gets to the point where it’s wrinkled like that.

107
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:25,792
When we use those, [?].

108
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:29,905
Peqlirnarqelluteng [Making it wrinkly], I don’t know how you can describe that.

109
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:33,152
But they’re kind of strong.

110
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:38,010
When you put them in your mouth, they’re bitter, and they’re kind of...

111
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:41,061
...kinds for sores in the mouth.

112
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:50,400
And you can use them anytime, even in the summertime.

113
00:10:55,284 --> 00:11:03,306
When we’re playing outside when I was young, we used to eat the shoots from these kinds of trees.

114
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:06,390
You know the leaves that are just coming out?

115
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,904
We eat those.

116
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:13,718
And then those, there’s all kind of plants that you can eat.

117
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:17,469
And some of the plants that are dangerous

118
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:21,316
If you don’t know them, you don’t have to eat them.

119
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:27,506
But anyway, she didn’t mention those. But we used to eat...

120
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,141
[?Yuuquq]. A yuuquq is here on this paper.

121
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:43,625
Oil, we Yupiit would clean out our guts with real [seal] oil, the oil of the marine animals, seals.

122
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,980
You know how we render oil from those?

123
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:59,755
During the year, you see, they would have us take a remedy once to clean out our guts.

124
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:12,691
I also practiced cleaning out my guys for a long time like that.

125
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:23,553
And as I had a lot of children recently, I would use it when I had a lot of children when I became a woman, because we practiced it.

126
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:29,846
Though I wasn’t sick, though nothing was wrong, I would take that remedy some winters.

127
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:35,852
A cup, filling a cup halfway with seal oil

128
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:47,843
We would start the morning when we woke up [like that] before there was anything in our stomachs, before food, with nothing in it.

129
00:12:51,187 --> 00:13:01,443
We would fill that cup haflway with seal oil, and drink it in the morning right when we woke up.

130
00:13:01,454 --> 00:13:06,754
We struggled. We’d finally finish it, oh my, because it’s strong.

131
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:13,343
Since we tried to make ourselves healthier, we would have it like that.

132
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:20,822
Then we’d sit still, sit still right then.

133
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:27,044
Our stomachs would make sounds, get bad and make sounds.

134
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:39,744
Then when we needed to defecate and went to the bathroom, a hard piece of feces from inside would come out.

135
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:50,589
Why would they have them clean out?

136
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:57,492
Then when it came out, only when the hard feces came out

137
00:13:57,499 --> 00:14:05,877
Then warm fish broth

138
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:14,582
We would take occassional drinks from that fish broth, putting salt in it.

139
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:23,818
When we occassionally drank that, we would defecate a lot.

140
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,596
It would clean out our guts inside.

141
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:36,471
But we wouldn’t eat, or drink anything hot until that broth came out from our guts.

142
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:44,775
We would eat, or drink anything hot since tea makes us stop defecating.

143
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:56,229
We would only drink what we call broth, fish broth, until we stopped defecating.

144
00:14:56,234 --> 00:15:04,367
Then one day, I examined what had come out of my guts inside.

145
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:19,525
I had no more feces to defecate, and the ones that came out last were hard, and were varying sizes. Some were big.

146
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:21,691
They were very hard.

147
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,464
A lot came out, and some were big.

148
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:35,389
Then out of curiosity for that big one, I took a stick from there and split it open.

149
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:42,678
After it couldn’t, it split open and I found that what was inside looked like a Western fruit [apple].

150
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:49,690
You eat Western fruits [apples]. Their inside are like that.

151
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:54,484
Though it was very hard, it split open and the inside was white.

152
00:15:54,491 --> 00:16:02,880
The inside looked like an apple, like those Western plants we eat.

153
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:08,646
The insides of those hard ones are apparently like that.

154
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:21,292
Though I tell you about what I used, I don’t know some of those remedies that I heard of but didn’t use.

155
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:27,170
But I told you something true. I’ve been telling you about what I used.

156
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:32,926
And just now, how I cleaned out my guts by taking that remedy

157
00:16:32,937 --> 00:16:40,515
The hard ones that came out last were green, very green

158
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:44,432
And their surfaces were hard.

159
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:48,669
I just talked about how I split that kind open and examined it.

160
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:55,268
During the year, they’d always have us clean out our guts.

161
00:16:55,282 --> 00:17:04,393
And though we weren’t sick, when we didn’t want to eat and our stomachs wouldn’t get hungry, they’d have us clean them out.

162
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:12,910
It makes you hungry, you see, it makes you want to eat after cleaning out your guts.

163
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:27,313
That’s how we used that seal oil, but we wouldn’t always do it.

164
00:17:27,325 --> 00:17:34,181
But we would do that in one year as a remedy.

165
00:17:51,198 --> 00:17:55,620
Joanna wants to take a break [?] for a while.

166
00:17:55,624 --> 00:18:07,236
She was saying that she used to use seal oil once a year to clean their insides, the inside of their stomachs.

167
00:18:07,245 --> 00:18:10,812
And they clean once a year.

168
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,567
She says she still does it now.

169
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:23,364
And sometimes in some winters, not every year now, but then she does it in some winters now.

170
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:28,303
She said they used to use it even when they weren’t sick.
