1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,723
Oh my, I was going to make frybread so that we would have some when I was done.

2
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,525
Let's stay here for a while.

3
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:18,380
Yes, I prepared, yes.

4
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:22,689
Yes, I'll make (?) so we can drink something hot.

5
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,034
And, you know, Kakianaq wanted you to walk outside.

6
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:27,564
Yes, oh my, I don't want to go out.

7
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:33,061
Or do you watch something out from the patio?

8
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,323
You soend leisurely time.

9
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:37,123
It'll probably be broadcast on TV.

10
00:00:37,883 --> 00:00:43,319
You know, you wanted your Waves of Wisdom recording to be translated?

11
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:43,873
Really?

12
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,640
Then when it's translated, we will use it.

13
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:49,660
What's your Yup'ik name again?

14
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:53,200
Elena, oh, Narull'aq.

15
00:00:54,101 --> 00:01:03,990
Now, please tell us stories about people would go to pick berries long ago when you were small.

16
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:12,621
Okay, I used to go berry picking when I was a little girls in Nalqigliq, going along with them.

17
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:18,097
I used a square five-gallon gas can as, you know, my berry container,

18
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:21,260
Because we poor people use square gas cans.

19
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:24,902
Then I filled it full and brought it home.

20
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:31,830
Then when I went home, my mother made Yup'ik ice cream with all of it and fed it to people.

21
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,870
We would pick berries like that, but did you just ask how they would be kept all winter?

22
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:45,092
Yes, how did people store them before they had freezers?

23
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:50,493
I used to see... see, I don't know how they picked berries.

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,740
In barrels, they would be in the porch.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,050
You know, our food would be in the porch and they would be cold.

26
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:06,260
I used to see our store of berries in the porch in a wooden barrel.

27
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:13,900
When you made Yup'ik ice cream, before there was shortening, what type of fat would you use?

28
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:20,010
My mother used to make Yup'ik ice cream out of tunut, you know, tallow, tunut.

29
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,090
Reindeer tallow.

30
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:34,969
She dried them, then after drying them, when she was going to make Yup'ik ice cream, she would them into a frying pan,

31
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,900
Then she would heat them on the stove, you know, like bacon.

32
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:46,281
Then they would boil, sizzing, then it would render.

33
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:50,180
And those pieces she cut up would bunch.

34
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,050
Then she removed them and, you know, wrung them like this.

35
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:05,478
She took them out, then that tallow, you know how bacon renders grease?

36
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:11,990
She would add the fat, you know, the real fat, tallow.

37
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:18,850
They would get snow, you know, that snow, little hailstones.

38
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:26,848
That kind. Then she would make Yup'ik ice cream, you know, periodically adding in that snow.

39
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:31,765
And when she made Yup'ik ice cream, she would tell us not to make any sound. I wonder why?

40
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:34,041
We would stay quietly.

41
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,182
That's how she made Yup'ik ice cream. I'm not sure at what stage she would add berries.

42
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:43,033
That's how I used to see that.

43
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:49,323
What else did they use? Would they sometimes add oil/fat?

44
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:57,730
Well, if it's all [solid] tallow, it would be very hard. You know how hard tallow gets when it's cold?

45
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,490
Then when it's added and mixed with oil,

46
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:09,930
It can probably be whipped into Yup'ik ice cream. I don't know of any other.

47
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:15,030
Do you know when they started using shortening?

48
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:21,240
Oh my, I do know. It was recent.

49
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,846
I was making my own living in Nunapitchuk.

50
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:33,130
I tried to make my own living. Then my male cross cousin who moved over there, Iilgayaq, Bristol Bay.

51
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:38,238
When he came as a guest, I said I had no Yup'ik ice cream.

52
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:43,452
I make Yup'ik ice cream out of tallow, adding in oil.

53
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:46,851
I used to do that without any knowledge of shortening.

54
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:53,070
Then that man instructed me when I said this, "See, I don't have any Yup'ik ice cream."

55
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,020
He said that if I want quick Yup'ik ice cream to use shortening.

56
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,489
Then when I took out my shortning

57
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:03,918
He took nothing but shortning like this into a mixing bowl

58
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:08,952
He told me to whip it into Yup'ik ice cream occassinally adding water.

59
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,251
They also add in Wesson oil.

60
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:16,734
I personally do it with milk.

61
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
Yes, it seems to be different in these lands.

62
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,790
Then ever since then

63
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:28,412
I never used kaugaq, tallow, but only shortning.

64
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:31,270
It's really quick.

65
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:38,270
Would they add in anything else like this, like tall cottongrass tubers or sourdock?

66
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:46,109
Yes, tall cottongrass tubers, one with sourdock. The one with nothing but tall cottongrass tubers,

67
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:49,490
By itself, I used to see it with nothing else added.

68
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,050
And this sourdock, they would add in berries, mixing them.

69
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,324
Is it here around Bethel or on the Kuskokwim,

70
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:03,852
Would you gather tall cottongrass tubers?

71
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:10,010
I don't know about them here on the Kuskokwim, but in the Akula region, inland in Nunapitchuk.

72
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:20,296
We had a place to gather tall cottongrass tubers over there, you know, there would be some there.

73
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:26,759
Well, what were the tubers' plants again?

74
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:37,022
Places with those have those tubers. Tall cottongrass, places with tall cottongrass.

75
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:48,431
Do you know how different villages have slightly different ways of making Yup'ik ice cream?

76
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:53,160
People from the Yukon, or other places?

77
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:01,390
Maybe. I know, I think it's people from up there on the Yukon.

78
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:07,569
They like to make Yup'ik ice cream, I mean, they also make Yup'ik ice cream with meat, you know, meat

79
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:15,170
White fish meat, after cooking it, then deboning it, then taking off their skins

80
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:20,024
Then wring them, then make Yup'ik ice cream.

81
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,806
You know, it's like they use them as snow.

82
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:29,190
Then this, what does it do? It rises, rises.

83
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:32,447
Well, I don't know those.

84
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:35,659
Except for the people up there, Yukon.

85
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:40,224
Then recently, that person invited me to go eat.

86
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:47,260
I had Yup'ik ice cream with meat, you know, with whitefish meat added. They do that.

87
00:07:47,378 --> 00:07:50,531
But how do they make aged salmon egg ice cream?

88
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:56,632
In the past, did they made salmon egg ice cream when you were small?

89
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,370
They made salmon egg ice cream with, you know, fish roe from the Kuskokwim.

90
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,461
You know they hang them to half dry?

91
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:12,536
Then they encase them. (Only king salmon?) Any kind, dog salmon, they would hang any kind of roe to dry.

92
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:18,265
Then my spouse and I had a lot of fish roe when he had a lot of dogs.

93
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:24,480
When he made food for the dogs, he would add in roe from there into the meat.

94
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,320
Then when we wanted to make salmon egg ice cream, the roe beneath inside.

95
00:08:30,462 --> 00:08:32,739
He would take some like this.

96
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:37,799
Some say, "Just like cheese." They say they are cheese.

97
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:41,430
They say it's like Western cheese.

98
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:47,380
They would make aged salmon egg ice cream out of that soft part that wasn't hard.

99
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:54,563
And now, they make fish egg ice cream out of whitefish roe. It's very good.

100
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:56,160
That's the first time I heard that.

101
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,287
Whitefish roe is very good, you know, crushing them.

102
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:04,740
They have no odor. Those [others] are, you see,

103
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,874
Roe from the Kuskokwim have an odor, you know?

104
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,397
They are, you know, rich.

105
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:21,769
These whitefish roe is very good, but after crushing them.

106
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:25,891
Then remove those things that look like hair.

107
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:30,392
They have things that look like hair. It's porbably the membrane from the roe.

108
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:33,177
They'd also make fish egg ice cream with those.

109
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:41,030
Do you happen to know any legends from long ago about Yup'ik ice cream?

110
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:47,180
I don't know. You know, I don't know legends.

111
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:50,811
You know, I didn't find anything fun.

112
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:55,966
Since I'm the one who visits others the most, I get suffocated easily.

113
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,681
Now, I don't know about any legends.

114
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,125
How did you go berry picking long ago? With kayaks?

115
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,057
We rowed boats.

116
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:11,864
One time from Nalqigliq downriver, at the old village sites across Napakiak.

117
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:14,651
You know, they're all gone now.

118
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:19,360
And my friend from Kasigluk died.

119
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,180
Tinker's wife.

120
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:25,729
She and I always played together, and liked to go with each other.

121
00:10:26,036 --> 00:10:29,804
We went along with those who went to pick berries in Nunapitchuk.

122
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,911
We kept rowed, you know, rowing like this.

123
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,350
Well, they rowed.

124
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:44,613
We rowed up to Nunapitchuk, very far away.

125
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:45,978
Would you camp?

126
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:50,008
But we would camp, how many [several] days.

127
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:59,190
Then my friend and I would watch over our containers, you know, the berries we picked.

128
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:03,903
Those, it was probably a five gallon bucket.

129
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,603
That's what I used for a container.

130
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,043
The other had a hole in it.

131
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,440
You know gas had metal [containers]?

132
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:19,980
They had [those] containers, five gallon. That kind. We didn't know of any plastic.

133
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:27,153
But after picking crowberries, how did you store them until you used them?

134
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:30,952
I would see them put into those things,

135
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:33,519
They stored them in empty flour bags.

136
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:41,650
Then they submerged them in water. You know, they used the water like a freezer.

137
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:45,809
It's because they would be good there where it's cold.

138
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:49,589
And I know, my husband and I did this.

139
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:53,843
We let that sink across from us in the water.

140
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:56,172
Into the river?

141
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,254
Into the river.

142
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:59,500
But it was a major river.

143
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:06,630
Somewhere across there, I think it was in Nanvaryugyaq where it wasn't a path, where the boats wouldn't go through.

144
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,280
Then when it got cold, we raised it, took it, and put it in a container.

145
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,790
What about blueberries? Would they do that with blueberries too?

146
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,079
Blueberries, well, I didn't have any blueberries, you see.

147
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,781
But we do get blueberries and eat them right away.

148
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,853
We only ate them right away.

149
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,649
We didn't do that with them because they spoil easily.

150
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,838
But they don't spoil in freezers now.

151
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:40,560
Would they make Yup'ik ice cream with anything else? Other things?

152
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:45,888
Cranberries? They also make crushed whitefish roe ice cream with cranberries.

153
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:48,120
Whitefish roe ice cream. Do you know about it?

154
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,884
How do they make it again?

155
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:54,986
We would make crushed whitefish roe ice cream out of whitefish roe, also crushing it.

156
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,585
Then after crushing it, we would also crush, you know, the cranberries.

157
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:02,546
We crushed them without adding anything.

158
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:07,280
But salmon egg ice cream takes a lot of work. Do you know about it?

159
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:14,090
When they were made into crushed whitefish roe ice cream back then, wouldn't they be like yogurt?

160
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,889
Yes, and they wouldn't add anything to that crushed roe ice cream.

161
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:22,531
Crush it, then after crushing it, after taking out those things that look like hair

162
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:25,805
Then add berries and crush the cranberries.

163
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:29,960
After crushing it, mix it, adding sugar.

164
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,086
Does crushed roe ice cream have fish roe?

165
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,040
It is made of fish roe. They make crushed whitefish roe ice cream out of roe, whitefish roe.

166
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:41,873
I only know that they only make crushed whitefish roe ice cream out of those.

167
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:48,926
Then, you know, it would be fluffy. Then when it became like that, they finished it.

168
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,764
But they would eat it with seal oil, a little bit of seal oil.

169
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:56,786
Well, thank you for your stories.

170
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,970
We're finally done.

171
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,870
Stop.

172
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,280
I’m shy.

173
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,140
Did you pick these crowberries from here?

174
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,550
Yes, when they picked berries here last year.

175
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,920
[?(S)he gave me food], I think two five gallons, all of them.

176
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,510
Because she loves to pick berries, she would bring them probably because she had no more room.

177
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,330
Your mom loves to [?].

178
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:49,690
When she was a girl, would go travel together like that? (Yes.)

179
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,520
That’s what [?] has always been like.

180
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,550
She finds everything, you know, enjoyable.

181
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,300
And recently, in Fairbanks...

182
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:02,085
I wonder if she can do it in English?

183
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,840
Something for Caucasians to lsiten to. I don’t want to keep translating what you said.

184
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:14,460
Yes, but [?Napaskiak] today.

185
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,040
They came to sew very [?]. She and my sister sewed.

186
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,610
[Sewed] what?

187
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,960
The grant we received...
