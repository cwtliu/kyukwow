1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:07,130
After having me paid, (s)he was daunted by landing.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:14,060
Then when (s)he asked us to go down, two of us went down.

3
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:25,250
And later, I stayed for a few minutes here, and the one I was going to go with called me.

4
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,950
He said the [?] were going to go inland.

5
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,020
He told me to go down quickly, and I went down.

6
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,840
Starting off

7
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:48,010
When they had an election about alcohol, it didn’t pass, and it’s how it has been.

8
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,730
What do you think about that?

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,260
It didn’t pass?

10
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,440
That alcohol regulation didn’t pass, the one where they tried to sell alcohol here again.

11
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,470
Yes.

12
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,910
What do you think about how it didn’t pass?

13
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:24,930
I absolutely do not support selling those at restaurants

14
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:35,810
Because I’ve always known that this [alcohol] is not used correctly.

15
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:44,940
I know that many of our young people are caught in that, drowning

16
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,920
And married couples get divorced.

17
00:01:50,710 --> 00:02:04,010
Also, when this married couple get out of hand, they take their children and have better people take care of them.

18
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:13,510
I absolutely do not like that because I’ve watched them from way back when I was young.

19
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:21,430
Because I used to see them before I was drafted here by the army

20
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,580
When I would come here to Bethel by snowmachine

21
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:38,570
Since I watch and know those who misbehave, I do not want them to sell that in restaurants here.

22
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,540
I’m very thankful since yesterday

23
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:54,910
Because I listened to the news anchors reporting that nay was the majority.

24
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,070
I’m very thankful for that.

25
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,740
However, without having established it

26
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:15,820
My mind will leave with you the next thing, because it says this:

27
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:29,130
They may not seel them in restaurants anymore, but it won’t stop coming here by plane.

28
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:37,580
I also just heard that this morning on the news.

29
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:46,830
Also, the one asking for signatures holds a petition.

30
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:55,230
They said that it will be put there

31
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,850
So that they will stop coming here by plane.

32
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,130
I will also keep a very close eye on that.

33
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:18,720
Without your knowledge, I have knowledgeable people help me to understand it.

34
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:30,800
Having reached this age this day, since it’s like I lose everything

35
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:39,170
I forget things and can’t understand some words.

36
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,110
I’ve also started forgetting what I’ve put down in here.

37
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,950
Though they’re right there, I forget where I put them.

38
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,780
I’m very happy for what was [passed].

39
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:04,560
So, it’s still like this now: they can bring in alcohol.

40
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:15,650
In your observation of that, how do you compare selling alcohol back then, and being able to bring it in now?

41
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,920
It’s not good.

42
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:36,160
I don’t want sellers to sell

43
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:44,020
And I don’t want a liquor store here in our town.

44
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:53,340
Our young people who’ve just stood up, who came after us

45
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:02,270
The young people know nothing about our traditional instructions

46
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,110
Our traditional Yupiaq instructions.

47
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:13,470
When spoken to, their mouths hang open.

48
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:20,010
When I speak to my grandchildren in Yup’ik, their mouths hang open.

49
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,760
Yet when I speak to them in English, they go.

50
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,450
All of them have become like that.

51
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:38,720
And when I go to little villages, these Yupiat would only speak English, these little boys.

52
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,320
I am by no means happy about that.

53
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:55,860
When it’s in plenty now, and I was part of the tribal council back then

54
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,060
Way back before these people grew up.

55
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,340
As a part of the council, we fought for it.

56
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:20,600
When it was time to vote when we noticed it was time to vote, we voted to stop that.

57
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,070
It was a lot [accomplished].

58
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:31,220
We had all of the [liquor] stores close up.

59
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:41,820
We Yupiat, when there weren’t a lot of Caucasians, overcame that right away then.

60
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:54,390
If several people like this, even five, speak with one mind, they are very strong.

61
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,000
But do not disregard God.

62
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:11,190
As he said, if three people are gathered in his name, he is among them.

63
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,920
And it’s true.

64
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:24,690
When I was in the army, I walked in a dangrous place when the Japanese went down there

65
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,230
When they came through the points down there.

66
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:40,260
When I was going to leave here, our pastor Makneq, he’s already died.

67
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,070
Makneq’s instruction:

68
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,730
"Do not give up praying."

69
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:57,070
Like that, that was the extent of his instruction to me.

70
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,800
It’s very true.

71
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:10,230
When I stopped among my peers, I would always remember it.

72
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:18,160
Also, though my peers misbehaved, I was with them and watched them.

73
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:27,300
And every evening, we would have parties when we were in school

74
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,770
There was alcohol among them, nothing but beer among them.

75
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:46,290
Because I knew about it, I tried not to take it up

76
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,100
Because it goes wrong, and ends with misfortune.

77
00:09:51,680 --> 00:10:04,190
My Caucasian friends here would encourage me to drink one can.

78
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,850
He eventually got mad.

79
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:17,530
But he didn’t lay one fist on my body here. Not once did a fist land on me.

80
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:25,660
When he started yelling at me, when they started yelling at me

81
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:35,580
I would answer them, would answer them in English as in their language

82
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:45,840
I said that only when he buys me a pop, any kind [of] pop, that I would drink with him.

83
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:55,090
After he was angry and pounding the table

84
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,670
He’d get better later and buy me a pop.

85
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,750
He’d have a beer, and I’d have a pop.

86
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,950
It was good.

87
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:16,890
Though I keep admonishing my fellow Yupiit

88
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:26,990
And James Active inland from the same village as me, though I keep admonishing them

89
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:36,150
If I weren’t with him, James Active inland would always be in jail

90
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,340
Because he likes to [party] with these Caucasians.

91
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,930
I treated him like my baby.

92
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:53,660
I would wake him up in the morning so that he wouldn’t be late.

93
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:05,260
Also, though these Caucasians drink, because they don’t break their rules in the army

94
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:10,060
The First Sergeant always woke up very early.

95
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:16,840
He would whistle outside of them, going around to wake them up.

96
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:27,920
Then they would always have alerts at night, [in the middle] of the night...

97
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:36,940
Without any excuses, when the fire alarm blared

98
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:44,750
We’d get ready, go out, and wake up everyone who was asleep.

99
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:51,330
Then we’d go inland, inland from the houses to the area between the spruce trees.

100
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:57,090
We’d hide in what they called foxholes.

101
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:08,010
Then the sergeant would arrive and circle us when it was almost time to go back.

102
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:16,960
When there’s almost a fire in Anchorage, a siren sounds at night.

103
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:30,960
I heard that you were one of the first mailmen here on the Kuskokwim. Please tell us about that too.

104
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,930
I wasn’t a mail man.

105
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:44,770
One time, I went with the mail delivery.

106
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:55,060
Downriver in Kuiggaq where it’s called Oscarville

107
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:01,660
That mail man lived there and had a trading post.

108
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,350
He’d taken over a trading post.

109
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:14,930
They would speak of that Caucasian

110
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:22,950
That he would row upriver here on the Kuskokwim to deliver mail.

111
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:35,190
And when going upriver downriver from Kalskaq, we would enter the little creek on the left.

112
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,570
We went upriver through there.

113
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:49,920
You see, three of us traveled from here to deliver mail.

114
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:59,600
The boat, we loaded a huge wooden boat with mail here.

115
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:08,760
You know, I know that they weren’t all mail at that time.

116
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:16,720
They were mostly beavers, you know, beaver skins.

117
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:25,140
They would put the mail in those huge mail carrying bags and lock them.

118
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,070
We stacked and pressed them down.

119
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:38,200
We loaded the boat, then covered it with canvas.

120
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,420
Then we covered the canvas with plastic.

121
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,170
We nailed down the outer edges so it wouldn’t open.

122
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:56,700
But where we would sit, the front, and the back would be empty.

123
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,550
We would put our gas reserve in the rear.

124
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:10,890
And there were no huge new boat motors back when I went.

125
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:20,220
That storekeeper placed a new seven horse Evinrude motor on the boat

126
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,530
And put a gas reserve in there.

127
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:33,280
And those things that have sails that they call Columbia.

128
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,990
The Columbia boats they use to travel the ocean down there.

129
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:53,600
We used one of those those that wasn't very big with a motor in it.

130
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,740
We pulled a vessel with that boat as we went upriver.

131
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,370
When we reached Kalskag, we anchored it in the water near them.

132
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,950
We went inland with that other vessel we pulled behind us.

133
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,370
He looked for one who wasn't lazy.

134
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,020
They called him Matvi, Matvi Brasken.

135
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:34,660
He used to be from Lomavik.

136
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,980
When we did that before Lomavik was deserted

137
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:53,560
My companion’s wife was that limping man’s sister.

138
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:08,040
Then one of the men looked strained wanting to go with us.

139
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:17,560
There were three of us men, with one woman as our fourth.

140
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:24,470
We went downriver, then went upriver through the creek over there.

141
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:31,510
It was narrow. Here on the banks of Cingik, things would be flattened.

142
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,730
It would be [?up on the bank].

143
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:42,620
Apparently, those were black bears’ fishing areas.

144
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,580
Then we arrived as we went upriver.

145
00:18:49,580 --> 00:19:01,850
The standing radio pole had another spruce tree placed on its side like this.

146
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,970
It had wires up there.

147
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:13,010
On the side of the that pole was a winch.

148
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:22,570
Stuck on the side of that was where you operated it.

149
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:28,580
We brought our boat to that.

150
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:35,770
We [?secured it] underneath at either end.

151
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:44,320
We raised it with the winch and set it askew.

152
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:51,150
We placed it into a square sled.

153
00:19:51,150 --> 00:20:00,610
And then we would go, pushing the sled.

154
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:10,420
The spruce trees were placed on their sides measuring steps like this.

155
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:20,950
Then on the trees placed on their sides was the path for the metal wheels.

156
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,640
That had those wheels.

157
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,500
We went inland through Qass’uqitak.

158
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,280
In watery paths, we would slightly bend our knees.

159
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,280
And when we went up on the tundra, we crossed through the tundra.

160
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,690
We arrived and there was a pole like that on the riverbank.

161
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:56,910
Apparently, it was at the end of the river Kuicaraq inland

162
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:04,490
The mail delivery path went downriver from its headwaters to Tumkuvigpak.

163
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:12,660
The metal sled stopped on that path there.

164
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,880
Then we put in our boat.

165
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,440
There were houses there on the banks of Kuicaraq.

166
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:35,810
That plywood house inland form that pole had various fish traps in it, even had wooden fish traps in it

167
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,150
Because the people from Kalskag fished there.

168
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,540
Then we went downriver on through Kuicaraq.

169
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,120
We went downriver following its current.

170
00:21:51,440 --> 00:22:03,680
Then the fork, the right fork when going downriver

171
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,630
We slipped into the little creek.

172
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,180
As soon as we slipped in...
