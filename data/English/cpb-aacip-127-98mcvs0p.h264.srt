1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,490
Through this, we used to try to get land and river animals, and fish.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,790
We would obtain [animals]. When we tried to gather and strived, we would get things.

3
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:23,670
And the one who didn’t try had nothing, was poor, and had no food.

4
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:31,505
That’s how they talk about that person that doesn’t try to gather.

5
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:35,775
But they said that the one who strives gets things.

6
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:48,487
In our time back then, the widoes, and, you know, the ones we call poor

7
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:50,931
And orphans

8
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:58,306
There were those kinds of people at that time who had no money to take care of them

9
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:04,494
Because there was no welfare at that time.

10
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:14,876
But the people that were able to do things themselves, who could catch things from the wilderness, the ones who subsisted

11
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:18,945
They are good at hunting and gathering, and gather food.

12
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:31,464
They said that those people were given the gift of catching things by the caretaker, God, who had them receive those gifts.

13
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:38,077
Our parents would always say this to us:

14
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:44,746
"When you are [on your own], when you start taking care of yourself

15
00:01:45,753 --> 00:01:54,953
"For the people, if you have some of your own, if you get things that are of help

16
00:01:55,947 --> 00:02:03,672
"Give as much food as you can for one who has no food

17
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:10,878
"Especially for widows, the poor, and orphans.

18
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:22,228
"And not only with food, if you have clothes for him, and spares

19
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:27,791
"Help him with the clothes he [needs] if you have any.

20
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:37,760
"If you can help that person if you have any to spare, you must do that."

21
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:47,917
Those people would also tell us

22
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,936
Not only that

23
00:02:50,943 --> 00:03:03,030
Some mornings when I was young back then, my mother would tell me when I got up

24
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:12,143
"Now, go check on the people out there.

25
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:20,893
"[Some] will have no water, no wood, they will lack something.

26
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:26,893
"Go to them and check on them, including the women and those who have no providers."

27
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:40,468
So, as she said, since I knew that those women and those without providers needed to be [helped] like that

28
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:44,474
The ones who couldn’t get wood and water by themselves

29
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:52,674
I went to them and helped them with my physical power even though it wasn’t food.

30
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:58,999
Being without wood, because they also said that wood was for food preparation back then.

31
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:02,162
They said that wood is like food.

32
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:08,306
THey said that one cannot cook food without wood.

33
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:15,550
That is what I wanted to share from those who raised me, telling me to do that

34
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:22,663
"Now, go check on the people out there, and help them with what they lack.

35
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:34,375
"Also, if you have any food, and you know someone [who is without], try to give that person food.

36
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:42,269
"You see, that person’s gratitude towards you is very great."

37
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:51,244
Watch, they said, our caretaker, the Spirit of the Universe will exchange his gratitude in greater amount.

38
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:57,407
This is all for this sharing.

39
00:04:57,414 --> 00:05:07,051
To help and give each other what they lack, depending on how much [they need].

40
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:12,551
This is all I have to say about this.

41
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:17,364
Okay. I just wanted to...

42
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:26,539
Helping each other is an ancient practice.

43
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:37,558
And back then, those who helped others wouldn’t want to take payment. The people long ago would help others without payment.

44
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:46,447
They would help others without needing payment.

45
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:53,885
The families, relatives, would stay together in houses, in one house.

46
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:57,266
At that time

47
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:08,022
The families, relatives in one house, a large house, in a sod house that had wooden furniture

48
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:10,541
They lived [there].

49
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:21,392
Across there, the two who made their own living up there, and here the two with children, four of them would live in a house like that.

50
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:29,455
I was also born on the cusp of that time, when they lived in traditional sod houses.

51
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:36,917
Relatives were tight knit. People back then loved each other.

52
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:44,161
And now, my ancestors are from Qinaq.

53
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:50,111
I am from the same village as the one from Qinaq who stood up and spoke this morning

54
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:57,136
That boy who was the very first one to open our meeting.

55
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:01,349
My ancestors, my parents were from Qinaq.

56
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:08,893
Back in my earliest memories, that village had one resident Caucasian.

57
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:21,006
That village is part of my first memories, where the houses were across the river from each other.

58
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:26,143
That village had that man as their one resident Caucasian.

59
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:35,149
It is unfortunate that helping others is no longer practiced these days.

60
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:44,730
Though these young people are able, they cannot help those who cannot provide for themselves to prepare.

61
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:49,230
They can’t do it without payment, any small payment, anymore.

62
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:54,143
Apprently, those people back then practiced love.

63
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:08,775
And those who can’t fish, and those who don’t work and can’t drink Western tea

64
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:16,044
All winter, they would have people eat the gifts they were given.

65
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:26,638
And in my earliest memories, my earliest memories of when I was very small and my father passed away.

66
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:38,514
And after that, from the place where I had my first memories

67
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:50,717
My maternal aunt’s husband brought us upriver here to Elumarvik.

68
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:56,627
I also stayed downriver at Elumarvik until I became aware.

69
00:08:56,634 --> 00:09:01,476
And ever since then, I’ve had become fully aware.

70
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:09,778
People took care of us, with my mother having no providers.

71
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:21,314
The gifts were cause for great thanks, food, and clothes

72
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:25,834
Clothing that covers the body here.

73
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:32,469
People’s gifts were extremely great in my mind.

74
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:35,918
I was extremely thankful for them.

75
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:46,835
I would covet families with fathers, those with large familes, with many siblings.

76
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:59,231
The people’s helping others, taking care of others, helping each other

77
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:09,752
Those people back then who helped others gave me something to say today.

78
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:13,242
I am extremely thankful for them.

79
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:21,156
Now, you see, you know you say that people’s behavior has changed these days.

80
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:24,908
We know what has changed.

81
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:29,335
Relatives, close relatives do not act as relatives anymore.

82
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:38,370
And they don’t know some of their relatives, their mom’s relatives, and their father’s relatives these days

83
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:44,621
Because the way people [used to] love each other has changed now.

84
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:55,006
And then when I asked after that time, " How did those people in that house live?“

85
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:57,804
My mother would tell me this:

86
00:10:57,827 --> 00:11:13,541
"In the live those people lived, one didn’t have any possessions, and this one didnt say their food was running out, and no one said [food] ran out.

87
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:19,416
"The extremely close-knit family ate from one store.

88
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:24,574
"And no one refused to share."

89
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:31,858
She said that those relatives helped out their relatives as much as possible.

90
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:40,528
They wouldn’t refuse them anything, and even if it was their only one, they would have them use it without payment.

91
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:55,693
These days, you see, every little thing needs payment that should be given as assistance, as gifts.

92
00:11:56,719 --> 00:12:00,890
We also had traditional instructions.

93
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:14,258
Even though we were women, just women, and though we couldn’t buy anything, they said we could help people out.

94
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:21,707
I thought this when I heard this: "I wonder what I will use to help others out?“

95
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,144
My mother said this to me:

96
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:33,720
"If you say something to someone who feels hopeless, you will help him if you tell him something good."

97
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,802
Then she also said this to me:

98
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:51,239
"The one who has torn clothes with no one to sew them, if you sew the torn parts closed, you will help him."

99
00:12:51,249 --> 00:13:01,691
You see, this is how we helped others in our lives back then when we had no money to help others.

100
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:04,753
That’s how we helped others

101
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:12,498
And because I used to do that, sewed close these [torn clothes].

102
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:18,447
You see, someone can learn to do it if they start this.

103
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:25,605
Then when they see torn [clothes], they will think, "Let me fix this."

104
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:30,866
One learns that way. You can learn anything.

105
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:35,548
When I did that, I learned how to do it.

106
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:42,552
Even if they’re Caucasian, no matter who they are, when I see them, I want to [help] them.

107
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:47,295
And I think, wanting to sew that tear closed

108
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:51,666
Because you can learn to do anything.

109
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:57,276
There are many ways you can help a person.

110
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:19,566
We understood a lot about a part of helping each other through food

111
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:27,018
Because we would help each other in our time back then, giving to each other.

112
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:37,396
And because people would have great scarcity of food in the winter, those who don’t catch anything, don’t fish, and are unable

113
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:46,332
Because through that, we go down to the water until they have food.

114
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:57,975
But now, we’re going to move on to this subject, helping each other

115
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:03,373
Helping each other.

116
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:11,914
Helping each other in accordance with something.

117
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:16,956
Or in vilalges, we sometimes practice that.

118
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:25,938
Sometimes, one of our own has a great job to do

119
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:30,073
Or trying to build a house

120
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:43,499
Or because they had wooden houses, because they didn’t have plywood at that time, and because there was no plywood at that time.

121
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:52,272
But because people here on the Kuskokwim would gather wood to make houses

122
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,392
Because people aren’t using those too much anymore

123
00:15:57,403 --> 00:16:12,374
And though they used what they called mud houses in my time, because they had those at that time in spring camps, fish camps, and winter camps

124
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:15,283
They used those for a long time.

125
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:25,922
But in these villages, when these small vilalges work on things, they ask for help because they find them difficult

126
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:34,131
And because these logs are not light, and we didn’t have machinery to pull them at that time

127
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:39,185
Because they only took [and hauled] things by hand.

128
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:57,200
Also, it’s because they speak to each other to notify those around them when they do something that requires help.

129
00:16:57,835 --> 00:17:05,164
Then those people who live in that small village

130
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:17,344
THey tell us to come even though they’re not working on something great that requires us to help.

131
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:28,590
When those adults work together on something and they order us to do things

132
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:38,345
We get that insignificant thing, and when they order us to get some tool or something, we would get it.

133
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:46,897
We’re like the arms of those adults when they work on something

134
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:58,680
Because when they’re going to make houses, they bring those inland to where they’re going to work on it, bringing them inland from the water here.

135
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:03,277
Or also

136
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:19,037
A long time ago, these villages would ask for help when they were going to work on this community house

137
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:27,305
Because making a community house was a huge job, and it needed huge pieces of wood for the structure.

138
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:34,012
They would invite villages, kelegluki.

139
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:43,394
When they thought that they didn’t have enough people, they would invite other villages to their own.

140
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:51,514
Saying that they were going to work on a community house, asking for help.

141
00:18:51,976 --> 00:19:01,862
Then that village that was invited arrived, they arrived because they were invited there.

142
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:07,399
The wood they were going to use was already ready down there.

143
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:19,160
Then the several villages, even two, that they invited worked together, helping each other.

144
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:26,684
They worked together on that huge sod house, that community house.

145
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:32,166
And because they would cover those community houses with sod

146
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:47,875
And because they would cover them with sod after they put in grass so it wouldn’t crumble when the wood they put on their sides were finished.

147
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:58,295
They worked on that like that until it was finished.

148
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:06,095
But when it was finished, the villages they invited, the gathered villages

149
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:12,334
They would have what we call today a potluck.

150
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:21,026
At that time, they would have a feast, a mini Messenger Feast potluck when that community house was done.

151
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:32,425
Then they would dance as a form of payment to them, giving them a joyous time.

152
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:42,492
After they had given them a feast, when it was done, they ended it with that feast.

153
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:48,899
They had a potluck, enjoyed themselves, and even danced.

154
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:54,333
It was like a [community] corporation, helping each other.

155
00:20:54,705 --> 00:21:04,019
Because they would help each other like that with one person’s job

156
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:13,052
With what they were going to do like that, they would help that person.

157
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:22,751
They even told us to helo like that, staying with them [in case they needed anything].

158
00:21:23,104 --> 00:21:33,318
Also, these villages, even though they weren’t [going to help] that one person

159
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:45,265
When they bring up something that needs help when this village wants to do something

160
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:57,796
They would say in the vilage down there, also because there weren’t a lot of villages

161
00:21:57,806 --> 00:22:04,735
After the Moravian mission first started

162
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:12,144
The people helped each other, and these missions’ plywood [houses] got built.

163
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:21,922
Starting from the missions, we made boardwalks upriver to what they called the big store.
