1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,690
Traditional wisdom, you know, for the young people today.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,020
You know, ask him about whatever he wants to talk about.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,020
You know, admonishing them or something.

4
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:19,525
Please start now.

5
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:22,615
Is it time now?

6
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:30,334
Now, these young people, before, when we were young

7
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:38,603
Our descendants now have completely left what we were like when we were young in the past.

8
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:42,525
What makes it worse is that they do not lack anything.

9
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:47,770
Because when we were young, everything was scarce for us.

10
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:52,642
Clothes, and all food, everything was scarce for us.

11
00:00:52,852 --> 00:01:00,443
However, it’s like the boys of the next generations these days do not know anything.

12
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:04,939
They don’t know how these ancestors worked hard to survive

13
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:12,949
Because they can easily take anything they want or need.

14
00:01:12,963 --> 00:01:21,181
In the past, we only used kayaks and rowed all the time.

15
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:26,286
I never saw a boat motor once back then.

16
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,948
And we had a [traditional] mud house.

17
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:35,088
And I never saw a Caucasian even once. Caucasians didn’t come anywhere near us.

18
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:44,330
Now, however, since there are now a lot of Caucasians, these young boys have become different.

19
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:51,688
Alcohol especially affects them. Alcohol makes them act crazy.

20
00:01:52,463 --> 00:02:02,463
Sometimes, they make me very despondent when they do that too much, using the wonderful days that are God’s gifts the wrong way.

21
00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:06,560
Without saying anything, that makes me very despondent.

22
00:02:06,657 --> 00:02:11,229
Also, when they blaspheme against our lord

23
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:18,363
For them, sometimes, my mind wants to say something thinking like this:

24
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:24,956
"We didn’t create ourselves. God made us. It’s okay if I don’t say anything to him."

25
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,497
You see, God made people for himself.

26
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:32,983
But they are divided now.

27
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:40,715
So, I hope that today, after this, one of these boys will come to a realization

28
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:46,837
May he come to a realization in case he is doing that the wrong way too much.

29
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:54,375
Now, we will not live for too much longer.

30
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,835
I have also taken upon many years. I had thought that I would have been gone already.

31
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:05,467
But I am thankful to God that he has allowed me to live this long.

32
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:14,401
If these boys always turn to him for help and go with him throughout all of their life

33
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:20,140
With everything he does, he may sometimes be given what he asks for.

34
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:30,618
You boys here, all of you boys here who are listening, remember this:

35
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:37,704
You were not born of yourself. However, God worked on you and made you to be born.

36
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:40,498
So that you would be his child.

37
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:48,282
However, you are not going by yourself. Also, you bring yourself to misfortune.

38
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:55,950
No person will help you as you try to live here aside from him.

39
00:03:55,961 --> 00:04:02,024
Only God will help you if you boys ask of it.

40
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:08,019
All of you who are listening now, let me tell you. Hear me.

41
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:15,404
A long time ago, before we had this these, every single person was extremely good.

42
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:25,385
We didn’t hear about anything that made us [?sad], well, and people going missing.

43
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:35,478
Now, however, for you boys who are listening, everything has become commonplace.

44
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:43,693
Every single things has become commonplace, including hearing bad news about something at random.

45
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:46,888
When something is put, it’s already gone [stolen].

46
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:53,227
If you remember that God made them, you would live life without paying them any mind.

47
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,484
Now, try to live life well from this day forward.

48
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,569
This too...

49
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:05,509
Is that all?

50
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,953
What was I going to say again?

51
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:28,098
Now, I am going to speak about what I’ve been thinking about lately.

52
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:37,098
Now, we have absolutely no respect to our creator, God our creator.

53
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:44,419
His nativity, Christmas, and Quyavik, Thanksgiving

54
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:50,703
You prepare for them the wrong way. You boys who are listening, listen now.

55
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:54,193
You prepare for them the wrong way, the wrong way.

56
00:05:54,201 --> 00:06:00,101
Yet what you are supposed to prepare, your heart inside, you do not prepare for God.

57
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:08,358
So after this, remember [not to] prepare the wrong way.

58
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,913
You see, we have no other help.

59
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:23,404
Since I also want to help you now, and I want to make you repent from the wrong ways of your mind. But since I’m not God, I can’t make you repent.

60
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:32,075
But you must kick yourselves off. You must kick your lives off, but only by yourselves. No one will help you.

61
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:35,241
Only he will help you.

62
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:44,695
Now, I am very thankful to these people who came from somewhere far away and had me speak about what I wouldn’t have spoken about, what I’ve been wanting to speak about.

63
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:51,300
And sometimes, when I come across KYUK over there, I want to speak.

64
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:57,963
I have been wanting to say this in case one of the boys might come to a realization.

65
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,935
Now, hear what I said, all of you who are listening.

66
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:15,936
And the people aroung you, and even here in Hooper Bay, I hope that some people, even just one, will say that in their mind.

67
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:21,723
Especially this thing that makes life end badly that you keep using

68
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:30,504
If this alcohol that you keep using were a traditional instruction, no one would use it.

69
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:34,265
You keep using it because it’s not traditional instruction, but an admonishment.

70
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:40,069
Yet you do not follow the traditional instructions.

71
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:49,531
Yet they are broken [from doing] what are not traditional instructions.

72
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:54,981
But I am thankful that I have spoken even though it wasn’t a lot. Thank you very much.

73
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:57,581
Goodbye and have a good day.

74
00:07:57,595 --> 00:07:58,584
Thank you.

75
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,406
Who are you in Yup’ik?

76
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,649
Cimiciaq

77
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:07,336
(Who?) Cimiciaq.

78
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,039
"Jimmy-and-Jack," Cimiciaq.

79
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:15,969
Cimiciaq.

80
00:08:17,486 --> 00:08:18,819
Cimiciaq.

81
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,637
It’s like English names, "Jimmy-and-Jack."

82
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:28,611
Cimiciaq.

83
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:31,231
How old are you?

84
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:38,279
Seventy-six years old. I’m almost 78. Seventy-six years old.

85
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:45,737
Without gray hair.

86
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:50,180
Do you have a husband?

87
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:54,095
No. (Did he pass away?) They passed away.

88
00:08:55,943 --> 00:08:58,420
Long ago, long ago.

89
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:01,770
How many children do you have?

90
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:03,930
There are four of them.

91
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,247
What about altogether?

92
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:11,084
Altogether, including the ones who passed away...

93
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:19,415
...and Nathan have a [?fisher’s]...

94
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:31,524
These are the medicine that we’ve always had starting from our ancestors, rosewort roots.

95
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,773
The roots like this, these rosewort roots

96
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,713
Our ancestors of old would peel them, peel them

97
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:52,687
A long time ago, when their children had sore throats, they would chew then then do this.

98
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:55,393
They [?] for them.

99
00:09:55,762 --> 00:10:04,518
Then when thye had other ailments, they would also put them on their sores.

100
00:10:04,747 --> 00:10:10,758
It helped them, but after they peeled, removing their outer layers.

101
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:19,148
And sometimes, they would peel them, put them into a pot, and boil them

102
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:26,632
They would also apply it here when they had sores or rashes, and here too.

103
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,728
You know, it was like an ointment.

104
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:41,602
They used to use these a long time ago, including the other ones, wormwood. People even drank them.

105
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:44,756
Do they also drink these?

106
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:45,551
What are they?

107
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,807
They’re, you know, (Rosewort roots?) rosewort roots.

108
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:55,260
These things (Yes.) I chew them when there are sores or rashes.

109
00:10:55,277 --> 00:11:01,977
When we have sores, they get better, and we use them when we have sore throats.

110
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:07,745
We only swallow their liquid, but don’t swallow these parts.

111
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:12,936
You know you told me earlier that you had a lot of sores before?

112
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:14,221
Ii-i.

113
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:15,383
Did you use those?

114
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:23,915
I used these when there was a sore outbreak in Hooper Bay including among the small children.

115
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:32,970
I used this because I heard that there is no kind of medicine [for sores] all over.

116
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:41,276
The sores grew large. And on my bottocks, they started pulsing along with my heartbeat.

117
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:47,070
Then I started thinking, remembering what the people up north said.

118
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:53,449
That urine, I went to get Amaurrlugaq’s urine [?].

119
00:11:53,461 --> 00:12:01,538
I went to get it with a container, washed myself with that, whoo, very strong.

120
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:05,350
And my body was burning, sore.

121
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:10,366
It was sore here. And I washed the slime of my buttocks.

122
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:17,477
I had been discharging slime. It’s like fish slime from the sores.

123
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:26,972
When I was done, I dumped that and replaced it with these [rosewort roots] that I’d boiled, and rinsed these [sores].

124
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:32,044
I rined with their liquid. I rinsed when I was done.

125
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:37,575
Them my body was in suffering, and it seemed that all of it was pulsing

126
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:43,033
Too many sores in my body, mostly in my sit[ting area].

127
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:49,668
They grew large, and they pulsed from my heart, along with [my heartbeat].

128
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:59,040
And next day, when I finally got better, I kept breathing it in. It’s like I smell it for long time.

129
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:03,457
It seemed it couldn’t get out of my mouth, my breath.

130
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:13,302
Then the next morning, you know, I woke up and they had become clean, had dried up.

131
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:22,234
And when they dried up, following that, they were getting better, until eventually they were gone.

132
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:26,990
And after that, I never went through that again.

133
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,638
What are those in English again?

134
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:35,553
Root, root...

135
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:40,444
What are these roots in English again?

136
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:46,108
Roseworts. Yes, these are roseworts.

137
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:51,876
Would they also use these rosewort roots for drift nets?

138
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:54,196
They probably also used them for drift nets.

139
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:56,073
(No.) Are they different?

140
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,561
(Those different ones.) These are different.

141
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,121
Those are yarrows.

142
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,508
No.

143
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:06,561
Yarrows... (These are rosewort roots.)

144
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,993
They’re rosewort roots.

145
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:13,601
The yarrow roots below...

146
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:15,870
THey use them on drift nets.

147
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:24,224
When they use them on drift nets, this drift net starts catching a lot.

148
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:26,425
From there...

149
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:32,594
They’re like Vicks. Others, other kidns are also like Vicks.

150
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:35,857
Yarrows are not those. Those...

151
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:40,827
Ready?

152
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:46,507
I know when I was a boy.

153
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:59,925
I was born, and I know when I was born, 1902.

154
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:06,077
I am 88 years old.

155
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,628
I am also now the elder of this village.

156
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:16,698
Now, I have no more elders too.

157
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:23,822
I work at the alochol [?mission].

158
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:32,822
I speak to these boys and those with mental health problems.

159
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:42,932
Also, I always speak to them about the traditional wisdom I learned back then, and nothing else.

160
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,892
They get better.

161
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:56,895
And even thought they had mental health problems, and they had thought of committing suicide

162
00:15:56,905 --> 00:16:04,916
They come to a realization when I have those as my speaking tools.

163
00:16:05,182 --> 00:16:14,149
In my first memories, I had instructors, and they instructed about everything.

164
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:19,937
Those were my grandfathers, great-uncles, and maternal uncles.

165
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:26,250
When I was very little child, my father also instructed me

166
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:31,070
But I lost my father without being able to fully observe him.

167
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:38,427
However, my mother raised me.

168
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:46,866
I also used to pity that mother of mine like that, looking at her [situation].

169
00:16:47,427 --> 00:16:57,438
Without my knowledge, she looked at me, I wonder what she was thinking. I looked at her and she had tears streaming down here.

170
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:01,851
It’s clear that she felt pity.

171
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:16,146
But the instructions when I had become aware as a boy should not be ignored.

172
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:25,071
And sometimes, their stomachs, when they didn’t have stores

173
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,527
When they only [ate] what they got from this [land]

174
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:35,702
Sometimes, they become downtrodden from their [empty] stomachs.

175
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:45,614
We would also be downtrodden because we had nothing, had no clothes, and did not ignore things.

176
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:57,212
Those people I was born in time to see, only had what they had obtained [?worked hard] for, not from stores

177
00:17:57,228 --> 00:18:02,461
That was the food that they had.

178
00:18:02,652 --> 00:18:08,519
Their bodies were also strong. I know them.

179
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:18,170
They these people looked old, they were strong like this.

180
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:25,052
Those people I saw in my first memories were also good.

181
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:27,236
They were compassionate.

182
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:33,689
And their traditional wisdom, they were good like [what the wisdom instructed].

183
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:39,899
They were in accrodance with their traditional wisdom.

184
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:52,549
Those whose responsibility I was always used to tell me not to act foolish.

185
00:18:52,564 --> 00:19:00,019
I also used to join those who were mischievous.

186
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:11,464
They said that those who are mischievous do not obtain anything.

187
00:19:11,473 --> 00:19:22,151
However, the one who is mindful, the one who always does what he needs to do

188
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:27,806
He would go through life right and well.

189
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:32,835
That was what we were like.

190
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:39,671
What we were like was nothing to boast about.

191
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:43,911
It would make us despondent.

192
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:54,346
And these Western things back then, the lumber and these [?]

193
00:19:54,364 --> 00:19:58,941
They would use that oil for fuel.

194
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:08,320
(When you’re almost done, I will wave to you like this.) Okay.

195
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:12,395
Has it started? You start?

196
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:13,841
Yeah, go ahead.

197
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:20,228
This is our medicine, rosewort.

198
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:25,222
In Yup’ik, it’s called caqlaq.

199
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:28,031
It’s our medicine when we have sore throats.

200
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,913
I’m going to cut it.

201
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
My goodness.

202
00:20:34,804 --> 00:20:39,627
I’m going to cut off a part of it and chew it.

203
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:45,023
This was their medicine a long time ago when they didn’t have [any other] medicine.

204
00:20:55,413 --> 00:21:05,947
When I had a very sore throat recently, the did things, the doctors gave me shots all over and I went to the clinic. They gave me shots.

205
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:10,718
I took these and ate.

206
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:15,859
ThenI ate and I found the next morning that my sore throat was gone.

207
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:19,989
But a long time ago, this was their medicine.

208
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:23,936
There’s some over there, and inland.

209
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:28,605
[?They say that when ?] there are a lot of them.

210
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:34,713
And altogether now, I got one whole full jar.

211
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,847
Though my daughter refuses and is scared of these

212
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:52,653
"You’re so foolish. Wouldn’t your grandmother tell you to eat these when you had a sore throat, and would chew them and feed them to you when you had sores?"

213
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:57,196
We used to do that a long time ago.

214
00:21:57,204 --> 00:22:04,148
And those things, wormwood, their juices too.

215
00:22:04,294 --> 00:22:08,616
And last year, not this summer

216
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:16,741
My last baby over there, I call my last baby my baby, because Peter is my last baby, because I love him so much.

217
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:22,157
He was very swollen. He went to the clinic, and the clinic didn’t do anything to him.
