1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:12,659
About Christmas from before, when you first learned about it when you were [?growing], what instructions did they give about generosity?

2
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:20,701
Back then, our ancestors were peaceful. They were peaceful.

3
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:27,902
They had their elders like this to instruct them, admonish them, and advise them.

4
00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:36,304
Also, they weren’t wealthy a long time ago. And these Western things weren’t on hand.

5
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:42,924
They would help those around them who didn’t have anything, as was traditionally instructed. That’s what they were like.

6
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:54,528
Also, they helped those who didn’t have anything by looking at what they didn’t have, and also lent them things. That’s what the people I was born in time to see were like.

7
00:00:55,347 --> 00:01:03,577
Then one who didn’t have a provider liket his, you know, these orphans, widows, they helped them with whatever they needed.

8
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:07,681
They helped them without expecting payment.

9
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:11,428
They also admonished against expecting payment.

10
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:17,434
They told them not to do this: "This person may reward me. Let me do this." They said not to do that.

11
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:23,875
Instead, without thinking of payment like this, help those who are in misfortune around them.

12
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:27,891
Seeve those who have no helpers. That’s what people were like.

13
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:37,068
What did they say was the meaning of being okay without payment, but to go ahead and help? What meaning did they prescribe to it?

14
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:42,007
They prescribed this meaning to it: that has good aftereffects [later in life].

15
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:52,774
You know, we didn’t hear promises back then. And we didn’t hear threats.

16
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,099
That’s what people were like.

17
00:01:56,605 --> 00:02:06,415
So, how old were you, how old were you when you first heard about Christmas? And what did you do [?] Christmas?

18
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:12,301
We started hearing about Christmas. We started hearing the Bible.

19
00:02:12,312 --> 00:02:19,522
And they also didn’t know of preachers, but they would hear of them, started hearing of them.

20
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:27,302
And one day, eventually, a preacher started arriving.

21
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:35,676
So, when Christmas first start, how did you...

22
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:42,026
We only started hearing of the first Christmas and when it began.

23
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:54,559
Then they started having Christmas, you know, when they were given a pastor downriver in the old village of Qinarmiut where I grew up.

24
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:02,700
When they were given a pastor, he started the Christmas tradition in my life.

25
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,791
What would [s]he have you do?

26
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:12,584
They’d celebrate Christmas as they do now, celebrating as told in this Bible.

27
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:19,760
And they would give each other things, you know, including little things.

28
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:23,704
People weren’t like this a long time ago.

29
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,539
And when this Bible appeared, they were absolutely nothing like this.

30
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:36,111
Instead, they’d give each other things. They’d even give each other smoked dried fish.

31
00:03:36,787 --> 00:03:41,457
When they didn’t have Western things, what else would they give aside from food?

32
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:45,525
Well, food, [they’d give] food.

33
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:54,406
Also, for those without anything, those who had [something to spare] would give them some little things.

34
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,240
(Would they not sing because they didn’t know?) They wouldn’t sing.

35
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:14,723
But, you know, they’d [sing] Yup’ik dancing songs from legends, oh my, that’s what I knew from the beginning.

36
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:23,365
They’d sing songs from legends, Yup’ik dancing, and drumming at the cusp of fall before winter.

37
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:25,383
It was the people’s tradition.

38
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,320
Then in the winter, they’d finally invite [other villages] and have a dance festival.

39
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:35,766
They’d [bring] as much food as they could.

40
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:41,165
Then when the Caucasians came, they also started [giving and eating] Western things.

41
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:47,483
That’s what the ones I was born in time to see used to do, the ones who first started celebrating.

42
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:56,261
This person’s tradition of giving to one who doesn’t have anything as much as they can

43
00:04:57,754 --> 00:05:07,954
When you started becoming observant, does it seem the same as our counterparts’ tradition of giving, or what is that like?

44
00:05:09,538 --> 00:05:16,188
And on account of one’s namesake, you know, these next generations

45
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:24,287
Those who are named after their late relative, they’d also give them a gift for that reason.

46
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,910
They would do that.

47
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:29,116
Even if it wasn’t Christmas time?

48
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:31,863
Yes, even if it wasn’t [Christmas] time.

49
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:43,581
And so, how old were you when these lay pastors or priests

50
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:48,581
How old were you when these traveling priests starting arriving here?

51
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:58,617
Where I grew up downriver, when I started getting wood, getting trees, they were given a lay pastor.

52
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:04,236
[S]he would preach like this in the community house.

53
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:10,894
When [s]he spoke of this Bible in the community house, we’d listen.

54
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:18,961
Then after that, we started doing [various non-Yup’ik] things.

55
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:26,988
That old preacher started arriving, an old person.

56
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:30,335
It seemed that Caucasian was sent all over.

57
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:34,193
[S]he was from far away yet spoke Yup’ik.

58
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:43,951
Now in some villages, in some villages, they take names [at random] and give presents.

59
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,658
Back then, [would they have Christmas like that]?

60
00:06:45,662 --> 00:06:50,252
They never did that at all.

61
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:53,438
They’ve started doing this sometime ago.

62
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:59,014
It was only until recently. It was recent.

63
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:10,911
When those lay pastors came to the churches, I mean, would they gather people in the community house, and how did they celebrate Christmas?

64
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:15,068
Those people didn’t celebrate Christmas.

65
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:24,543
But the guests that came, this lay pastor among them had us start celebrating Christmas in my short life [at the time].

66
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:27,048
How did [s]he have you celebrate?

67
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:36,805
[S]he had us start celebrating like this with Christmas [songs], you know, they started singing Christmas songs.

68
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:46,365
However, they would give each other little things. They’d give each other little things.

69
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:48,772
They only started in my lifetime.

70
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:59,766
So, what do you want for Christmas this year?

71
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,719
Have those who are listening hear.

72
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:15,196
The birth of Jesus, that I didn’t hear about a lot back then, for our sake

73
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:24,621
This is what it is: this, our unseen life, this Holy Spirit is our life.

74
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:30,485
That’s what it is. They say this is like this: you know, because God is powerful

75
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:42,015
You know, he made this Word flesh, made seen what was unseen, only heard of.

76
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:45,829
He made him seen, made flesh, and had him be born.

77
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:49,032
They say Jesus was born like that.

78
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:56,837
His father had him be born. He gave him as a gift to this world. He was a gift.

79
00:08:56,864 --> 00:08:58,914
This is true.

80
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:08,139
Like this, you know, in one of the songs, there are lyrics like this: "Look at me, believe and accept my gift."

81
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:20,576
To those who do not accept him like this, youo know, to those who don’t accept Jesus, there is a verse in the Bible like this:

82
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:29,638
"He makes only those who believe in him worthy to become God’s people, the ones who believe in his [Jesus’] name." There’s a verse like this.

83
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:39,204
Then for those who accept him, he goes into their life

84
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:43,772
Only if [s]he accepts him, only if [s]he accepts him in earnest.

85
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:48,608
Then he becomes a savior to that person. He becomes a savior.

86
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,580
However, to one who hasn’t accepted him, he doesn’t become a savior to that person.

87
00:09:54,815 --> 00:10:00,785
Then it’s like this, there’s also a verse like this:

88
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:07,680
"I admonish those whom I love and chastise them. For that reason, enthusiastically repent.

89
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:11,459
"And look, I stand at the door and knock.

90
00:10:11,462 --> 00:10:22,082
"If a person hears my voice and opens the door, I will go in and eat with them, and them with me." There’s a verse like that.

91
00:10:22,177 --> 00:10:29,147
Then if a person doesn't welcome him, he will leave them on on wayside without having become their savior.

92
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:31,169
That's what it's like.

93
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:44,217
Then I want to talk about God’s advice like this. I want my voice to spread.

94
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:53,184
If a person passes away in sin, and now, we heard yesterday that someone passed away upriver in Kwethluk.

95
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:57,898
Then that person from here also said this:

96
00:10:59,298 --> 00:11:06,667
"There is none among us who lives by themself or dies by themself. But as we live, we live for the Lord."

97
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:15,405
The believers’ creed says this: "We live for the Lord. And when we die, we will die for the Lord."

98
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:27,616
That’s why whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s. That’s what believers have said, and it’s true. It must be true.

99
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:31,633
However, those who aren’t true won’t experience that.

100
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:40,281
If a person isn’t true, they will die, then their life will pass in misfortune.

101
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:44,866
Instead, [s]he will be in fire.

102
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:57,632
I spread my voice about that to the people, and [I spread] my voice to our counterparts here.

103
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:05,550
I’ve been thinking of one of you lately wanting to speak of this, but I was uncomfortable and intimidated by you.

104
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:10,826
Then I thought that one of you would translate what I said.

105
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:16,137
If a person passes away in sin, lives this life unacceptably

106
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:26,793
Instead, [s]he will go into the lake forever, to be in fire forever in the utmost suffering.

107
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,079
There are many ways to resolve our lives.

108
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:36,841
But when a person is no longer here, we’ve heard [of one] upriver.

109
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:39,628
Then at that time, [the life] stops.

110
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:46,014
You know, with whatever resolution [that life] had.

111
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:48,118
So now...

112
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:51,974
So then this...

113
00:12:58,038 --> 00:13:07,878
You see, this is my thought: that either you or Aqum’aq would translate what I said into English.

114
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,889
I want them to understand how they could [live] well.

115
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:16,188
Let’s see.

116
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:21,056
Our workplace here has a policy like this...

117
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:30,111
Now, wish us good tidings, tell us of your thoughts, you know, wishing us a Merry Christmas.

118
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:40,486
Okay, so let me talk about it now if I have some of those people to listen to me.

119
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,570
Jesus’ birth, you see, God... is it going now? Is it going now?

120
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,290
Yes.

121
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:57,172
You see, God’s love fo the people of the land, how there is nothing greater than his love for the people of the world

122
00:13:57,184 --> 00:14:04,114
This is what Jesus is like, it is told like this in the Bible saying this:

123
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:12,453
"The Word was always there, and the Word was in God, and the Word was God."

124
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:19,370
Look, it’s like this: it just said when when the Word has always been, not talking about its beginning.

125
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:28,729
Look, how there is nothing greater than God’s love, it’s like this, now understand it:

126
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:36,996
It says that there, you see, it’s light has a greater light than the light here.

127
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:44,774
Also, inside those is a shape that is happy and joyful but without anything added.

128
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:51,915
Furthermore, there’s also a song like this, there are lyrics in a song:

129
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,369
It said that had Jesus not been hung, every person’s life would be lost.

130
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:05,893
Then when Jesus came down, it was like this: look how there is nothing greater than his love.

131
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:16,444
Look at the light, the wonderful light, and the darkness below, miserable death, repulsive.

132
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:24,846
Furthermore, with the extent of God’s love, it truly seemed that he sent Jesus down right away.

133
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:32,320
It truly seems that he put [Jesus] over from the people of the land, put the people of the land closer to him with the greatest love.

134
00:15:33,218 --> 00:15:42,188
With so much for this, I like that one too. I don’t mind it.

135
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:52,520
Then should there be time for me to talk about what I wanted to, and should you want me to, I would.

136
00:15:52,577 --> 00:16:00,357
Please wish a Merry Christmas to us who are watching now.

137
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:06,531
All of you who are listening now, I say hello and wish you a Merry Christmas.

138
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:07,973
Thank you.

139
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:08,748
You’re welcome.
