1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
How these women love these children

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:14,000
Because they especially take care of them when they’re children starting from when they’re born.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:27,000
As much as Lucy knows about some of those, how to love these children

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:37,000
She will speak to us about what she knows and what she personally thinks.

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,000
What you know about these children, how to love these children

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:56,000
Women take care of them starting from birth when they take care of them from birth.

7
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,000
Please talk about what you know concerning their love for children.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
[Taking care of] children a long time ago

9
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:23,000
Our caretakers cared for us by talking about everything.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They would always talk to us starting when we married letting us know everything [that they could].

11
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:40,500
They also talked about how to take care of children if we were to bear children.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,800
You see, our caretakers were not how we are these days.

13
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,900
We didn’t see a lot of Caucasians, nor did we see things like money.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I didn’t see money for a long time.

15
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:09,800
Because I grew up poor, I didn’t have those kinds of things.

16
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,000
Neither do I forget how my mother took care of me.

17
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,000
I remember it clearly.

18
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
My mother took care of me like this:

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
She didn’t allow me to be frivolous with food, food or water.

20
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,000
What she gave was the only [stuff I ingested].

21
00:02,38,100 --> 00:02:42,000
You see, my stomach is used to it now.

22
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,000
I’m going to tell youpl what I’m like.

23
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,000
My stomach inside is used to how I’ve always eaten.

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,700
I will not fill it before noon even to this very day now.

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,600
Neither will I fill it before it’s time for dinner.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,500
It’s used to me not eating randomly.

27
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,400
The first people back then were not like this.

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,400
They did not eat randomly in between meals

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Because there were these three [set] meals: drinking something in the morning,

30
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,400
And then at lunch at noon, they would finally eat real food.

31
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,500
We ate then and turned out to be full.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,500
And what our mothers gave us were not [entirely] filling; they would leave us wanting more.

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,500
And we would eat dinner in the evening.

34
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,800
And then after that, we wouldn’t ingest anything else until morning.

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And our stomachs would be used to it, so we wouldn’t be thirsty at night.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Only in the morning would we [ingest] a little when we woke up.

37
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:12,900
And when my mother gave me a piece of pancake when I had nothing else, she would give me a little nibble because we didn’t have a lot.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,500
And I wouldn’t add to or try to add to what little she gave.

39
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,500
You see, a person can do this.

40
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,500
And if our descendants learn, they can do it.

41
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:41,800
I am continuing that only with my stomach to this day through my eating habits.

42
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:51,700
However, some of those things are changing from what I’ve taken care of.

43
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:59,000
But, they wouldn’t let us nibble as we walked around or were standing.

44
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,000
They wouldn’t not let us eat standing.

45
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,000
And I see this today too; and when I came in this morning, I watched youpl

46
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,000
People drinking coffee take the cup and then walk around.

47
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,500
Listen, does it really settle well inside?

48
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,000
This is how it has changed

49
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,500
How the instruction of those first people back then changed.

50
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
I watched youpl when I came in this morning.

51
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,400
After this person filled [a cup] without asking permission from above

52
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:42,000
After he fills a cup, he goes, drinks as he walks, and goes into rooms.

53
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,800
You see, this is how it’s changed.

54
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,500
Youpl say that the life of the people back then has changed.

55
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,000
This is one of the changes.

56
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:07,000
When we bore children, you see, they didn’t let their urine make a mess.

57
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,200
We didn’t take care of our first children with repeated diaper changing.

58
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Children started using diapers when Caucasians became numerous.

59
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,600
We took care of children by waking up with every little move they made.

60
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
We with children could not be lazy.

61
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,500
Because we loved children, we took care of them with a lot of love.

62
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,000
We didn’t leave them a lot and didn’t babysit.

63
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:49,500
And now, I’ve had 14 children.

64
00:06:49,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Those ten, I gave birth to these ten in my home without going to the hospital.

65
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
And then these four after the [first] ten

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:17,500
Because my body was a little amiss, I finally went here [to the hospital] to give birth to these four.

67
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,700
But these three were not born in the maternity wing

68
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,700
But this last youngest one was born in the maternity wing.

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You see, I did not suffer for long, nor was I in labor for long

70
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,700
Because I had already suffered to give birth.

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,800
I'm talking about what I know.

72
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,000
When I was first pregnant, my mother instructed me,

73
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,600
“If you want to give birth without problems, and if you want to have a good laboring period that’s not too long

74
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,000
“Every time you think of it, go outside at night and in the morning.”

75
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,000
You see, we adhered to what instructions we had without doubting them.

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,500
We adhered to them.

77
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:30,000
And then when the child was born, we took care of him.

78
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,000
We took care of him with our mothers to instruct us.

79
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,000
Every time the newborn child rustled from sleep, we had them urniate [in a waste container].

80
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,000
We always did that, never wetting the bad, always keeping it dry, and we never made a mess.

81
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And when I started with that, when I learned [the ways of] clocks when clocks first came

82
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,800
I learned when they defecated and urinated by the hours.

83
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,000
I truly took care [of children].

84
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,500
You see, our caretakers, our mothers would tell us

85
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,700
“When [s]he grows up, do not shout at him.

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,800
“Admonish him without raising your voice.

87
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,700
“If you do that, [s]he will not obey you.

88
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,700
“However, if you raise your voice and shout at him loudly

89
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,700
“That child will not live right.

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
“He will be stubborn and disobedient.”

91
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,800
You see, I am talking about what instruction I had that I know.

92
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,800
They would say back then, I hear people say this:

93
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,000
“The life of Yupiit is changing now.”

94
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,000
That’s how they’ve changed.

95
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:17,300
You see, everything had traditional wisdom connected to it for us; it had instructions.

96
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:32,000
When we disobeyed them sometimes, there is also regret when we disobey that traditional wisdom.

97
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,500
That’s what I know about taking care of children, loving children.

98
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,500
If a person loves a child, [s]he must take care of him with love like that.

99
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,500
They must also have them know about what brings misfortune. 

100
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,500
Let them know what will cause them shame, what will get them incarcerated, what will put them into jail.

101
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,000
You see, our children are the most important for us parents.

102
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,800
And if by chance one of our relatives is incarcerated

103
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:24,500
His parents cannot socialize well with their families because of that

104
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,500
Because they2 raised them, because they2 took care of them.

105
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,800
You see, this is how [our lives] have changed.

106
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We say that the traditions of those people back then have changed.

107
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,800
We know that it has changed now.

108
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,600
I just started off with what you know of one of the changes.

109
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,000
They didn’t let us ingest anything as we wandered about.

110
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:08,400
And even if we were very thirsty after we ate, they wouldn’t give us water right away.

111
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,000
And then our mouths would be dry because we were so thirsty.

112
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,900
That saliva turned white.

113
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Only when that happened, they would give us a little water and then we drank that.

114
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:32,000
And even when we really wanted more, we wouldn’t add to it because they wouldn’t let us.

115
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,400
We waited for meals. We were used to it.

116
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:48,000
My stomach only knows and is used to how my mother took care of me.

117
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,500
It got used to not drinking anything outside of meals.

118
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,500
I would like to translate what you just said into English for those who do not speak [Yup’ik].

119
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I also just said that children didn’t have diapers.

120
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,000
We didn’t put them in those as we took care of them.

121
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We watched over them, keeping their urine from going on the floor.

122
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,000
She said that…

123
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,000
Say that my mother helped me when I first [gave birth]

124
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:36,000
But after I gave birth, my mother helped me once with the eldest.

128
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:44,000
And afterwards, when I was going to give birth to the next one

129
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:51,000
Across there in the original Bethel where the landing strip was

130
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,000
I gave birth to the second of my eldest.

131
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,400
I knew that [s]he was going to be born.

132
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:09,500
Because I knew, I prepared a mat for when I gave birth.

133
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:21,500
After I prepared a mat because it was in the summer, in July, I gave birth a second time on July 6.

134
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,200
And then when I was [in labor] after I prepared, I took out scissors

135
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,000
Because I watched how my mother took care of it when I first gave birth.

136
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,000
I set out scissors and thread to tie be tied.

137
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And then when that child was born, I took care of it myself.

138
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,500
[Here was] the belly button, umbilical cord here, and the end over there.

139
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,500
When [s]he was born, I tied it, and tied it here.

140
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And then I cut it with scissors in the middle.

141
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,800
I took care of them myself

142
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:16,400
But these four after the ten, qulem cipneri, because I [gave birth] 14 times

143
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,000
I’m telling you this story.

144
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What [?]. Did you understand? [?]

145
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,000
…because some women are weak.

146
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,600
Back then, when there was no other woman in the village.

147
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,900
When they2 [delivered a child] by themselves2, they2 helped each other.

148
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Her husband would tie their umbilical cords and cut them.

149
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,400
When there was a women close to them

150
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,000
Her husband invites here, telling her that his wife [is in labor] and for her to be with [his wife].

151
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:14,000
Another woman would help her from what I know of back then.

152
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,900
However, because her husband has no help when they have none, when she can’t do it herself

153
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,400
Her husband helps her deliver the baby.

154
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,900
This is what that’s like.

155
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And then part of loving children is like this:

156
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:54,500
When a child can’t get up, his teachings are unintelligible

157
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,500
And even though [s]he is told, [s]he doesn’t understand, isn’t yet able to understand.

158
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,500
And when he finally wakes up and his body is strengthened, wakes up, starting to sit

159
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:18,000
These things dangerous to him, how things on the table when they eat

160
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,000
Because that child doesn’t know that [s]he will get burned

161
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Have that child briefly touch that hot thing.

162
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:40,000
And then after that, try to have him touch that [hot thing]

163
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:47,000
That child will have already learned. [S]he will know that it’s hot.

164
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,200
They say that should they somehow get accidently burned

165
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,000
[S]he will know that it’s hot [and avoid it].

166
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Because it's like they are gradually learning when they start sitting.

167
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,500
And when they start feeding them when they start eating

168
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,000
[A parent] teaches their child about those.

169
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:29,000
Also admonish him against grabbing these various things.

170
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,800
Don’t let him grab things, and don’t give him things to grab.

171
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:41,400
They say that when a child grows up being allowed to grab things

172
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Allowing him to grab these [various] things as he grows up

173
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:03,500
When he grows up and he is able, he has no reservations about taking things.

174
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,500
[S]he can also take another person's possession when [s]he wants.

175
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Because [s]he was not admonished, being allowed to take whatever [s]he wanted whenever [s]he wanted.

176
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:26,400
However, when [s]he is admonished against those from the beginning

177
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
[S]he will also learn like that.

178
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Also, when [s]he starts understanding [words], when the child starts understanding

179
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:43,000
When [s]he starts understanding what we say as [s]he grows a little

180
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We have traditional wisdom from those who raised us for when we have children like this:

181
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,900
A child is aware when [s]he first wakes up.

182
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,500
[S]he isn’t unruly when waking up, not shouting, not laughing

183
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,500
But quite, because they say they are aware.

184
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:22,500
They say that when he is aware, we should then tell him some traditional wisdom.

185
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:31,500
They say that when they are aware and focus on traditional wisdom.

186
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,000
They sometimes tell us, “Look, [s]he’s suddenly aware.”

187
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,500
When these children are suddenly quiet like this,

188
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,000
“[S]he suddenly aware,” watching one thing.

189
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,000
They day that's what it's like.

190
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,800
If that child is spoken to like someone older

191
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,800
[S]he will not forget it and remember it more clearly.

192
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,500
But [s]he is more still later after being told traditional wisdom.

193
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,500
We also start moving about and [doing things] when we wake up.

194
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,000
And then after that child is still

195
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:22,000
[S]he starts moving about and is like [s]he’s unaware now.

196
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And then when [s]he grows a little more, say to him,

197
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,500
“Now, treat your peers with love.”

198
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:40,300
[A parent] tells him this because they love him, telling him to treat his peers with love,

199
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,400
“Now, treat your peers with love today.”

200
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:54,500
They say that because his mother or father loves him, [s]he also wants him to go well [in life] with those [peers]

201
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,300
Tell them to treat their peers with love because it’s the most important instruction.

202
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And then, they say that someone, even if that child is not her own, someone else’s child

203
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:26,000
When she sees him, she will tell him traditional wisdom as if he were her own, loving him as much as her own children.
