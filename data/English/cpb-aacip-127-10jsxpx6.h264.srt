1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I used to see Qakianaq back when I was a boy.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Luqinquq, the old Caucasian man they called Luqinquq had a store down there.

3
00:00:12,00 --> 00:00:18,000
So now, since you became observant, starting when you became observant

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Urucaraq here, from what you have observed after you were born in Urucaraq

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Talk about how Bethel here has grown and changed to this day.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,500
I just started off by telling you about what I observed.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,900
Yes,[but] the [device] down there wasn’t going.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Just now, it’s just started again now.

9
00:00:40:500 --> 00:00:43,000
You asked me about that community house.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,900
I observed that community house when it was standing.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,900
And back when they took fire baths

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
When they covered the smoke hole after they took fire baths like this, we would go in and see them.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Because when they were finished, the old men would talk inside the community house.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,900
It was also hot.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And when they had just taken fire baths in the winter like this, it was nice and hot.

16
00:01:12,00 --> 00:01:17,000
When these old men that we liked to go see started talking, they started talking.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We would go listen to them because they were pleasant.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:29,000
But because I’m inarticulate, I forget what they said [?].

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How would they cover the smoke hole?

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You mean how they covered the smoke hole?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When they finished taking fire baths, when the fire down there was going out, one of them would cover the smoke hole.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They would cover the smoke hole of the community house.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And after they closed it, those men would be naked like this when we entered.

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,900
They hadn’t put on clothes.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,800
It was probably after they had dried off.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
These settlements, Aagurmiut and Urucararmiut, had one community house.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Sometimes in the winter, probably when Aagurmiut wanted to take fire baths

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They would drag sleds with wood inside and go to the community house together.

29
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Down there through Kepenkuk

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
They would go over there to the community house through Kepenkuk

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,000
Because Urucararmiut and what they called Aagurmiut upriver from them had one community house.

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,000
The [settlement] down there is actually Aagurmiut.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Those people would gather

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Because it seemed that they lived like this without animosity toward each other or discrimination.

35
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,000
And because those people of old would help when one of them came to some misfortune.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
They wouldn’t ask for money or a reward.

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,000
They helped each other from what I’ve seen.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,900
Murilkellemni tua-i ava-i qanrutamken.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The community house inland, down around Joe Lomack’s building downriver

40
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,000
Its back wall was toward the water from there.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,900
The one they used to call Urucaraq wasn’t a lake, it was dry but had a river.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And its river, the bridge down there

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That first schoool uprver, upriver over from the Moravian church

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Yes, the old church

45
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,000
There were steps made of boards reaching down to Aagurmiut.

46
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,000
That is, to this Luqinquq.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Luqinquq had a store there.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He had a Caucasian partner who had a house toward the water from him.

49
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,900
Those were partners in those days.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,900
They called him Kassaussaaq [Trying to be Caucasian].

51
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Those people of old were good at giving various names suited for them.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In my earliest memories back then

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There were Caucasians in between here

54
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,900
In between Aagurmiut and Urucaraq, but not a lot.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,900
They also talked about Kenirkauyar back then.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,900
Kenirkauyar there was a [Western] dancing hall here.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But they didn’t do it at random [times] like this, only on Saturday.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,500
It also went until 12 o’clock.

59
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
That was when they stopped.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And they wouldn’t let us frolick all the time.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,900
At midnight, they would tell us to return to our villages.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,900
They also admonished us against wandering about.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You see, these first Caucasians back then

64
00:05:13,500,000 --> 00:05:18,900
They also apparently helped each other back then like Yupiit.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Even though we were Yup’ik, sometimes even Caucasians would admonish us.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Also, even though I was to be mischievous

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,500
My late mother talked to me some morning, even if it wasn’t all the time.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,900
I would become unable to move when she talked to me even though she didn’t do it all the time.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,900
These days, I don’t hear people speaking [to the young people].

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,900
It’s because we who have become elders have gone out.

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,500
It’s like our traditional wisdom is sleeping.

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,900
Our traditional wisdom, they would tell us to especially revere our land and the water.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,900
Revere it.

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,500
This is what our teachings were like:

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,500
We should [treat it with as much respect] as our bowls.

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,500
These days, it’s not like that.

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,900
It’s become different.

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What does it mean, as much as our own bowls?

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,900
This is how I understand it:

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,900
Our bowls, when we eat

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,900
It’s probably because a person back then had one bowl that [s]he watched 
over.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
[S]he loved and revered it.

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I think that that was a metaphor

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
To revere our land and the water as much as our bowls.

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That’s one piece of traditional wisdom from the people of old.

86
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,000
They also used to say

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That a boy should not have relations with a girl before taking a woman [as a wife].

88
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,900
We these days are destroying ourselves.

89
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We are apparently destoring our lives, and destroying our bodies.

90
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,900
And through this alcohol that I heavily abused.

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,900
That is evidently something that destroys our bodies.

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Also, when a person misbehaves, it is visible in all the land.

93
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,900
Especially back then.

94
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,900
Because they were especially well-behaved back then

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
One who occasionally [misbehaved] was clearly noticable.

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
These days, though it happens every day, we have become [worse].

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,900
It’s also because we elders do not say anything anymore.

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,900
Back then, they used to talk to [the young people], even if they didn’t say a lot.

99
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They didn’t do it excessively.

100
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,900
They would also sometimes gather us in the community house and speak to us.

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And over there, the first Caucasian Moravians would sometimes gather us and speak to us.

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,900
These days, they probably do that sometimes.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,900
But my inability to understand English is getting worse

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Even though I understand a little now.

105
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,000
My deteriorating hearing is probably making it worse for me.

106
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
They’ve started speaking mostly in English now.

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But youpl young people know that well.

108
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Because we back then did not have a thorough education

109
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I don’t understand people who speak completely in English

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Even though I touch on some of them.

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,900
Ask me questions.

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I am the most ignorant.

113
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, something that you can think of

114
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,900
One piece of traditional wisdom that you can think of

115
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Or please tell us several that you can think of.

116
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,900
Back then, this was the most important one they said:

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
They would tell us to help these people that were struggling or that were unable.

118
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Also, they said not to make fun of anyone even if they were struggling under any circumstances.

119
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That is probably bad.

120
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,900
They told them to instead help these older people who were unable.

121
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They said that a person’s mind is powerful.

122
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,900
Also, even if we entered another house

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07:900
Under any circumstances, even a match, a nail, or a single thing

124
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He used to tell me not to take anything from that house.

125
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
How much is it [now]?

126
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
They also said that in the wilderness, a person does not forget what [s]he put in the wilderness

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Even if it’s the wilderness.

128
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,000
That is probably true.

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
They said that a person does not forget what [s]he put even in the wilderness.

130
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You just asked me about something important.

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,900
My instructor always used to tell me

132
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
To never under any circumstances make fun of anyone struggling.

133
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He said to help someone that was unable instead

134
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Without talking about money for payment.

135
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,900
But why did they warn so much against boys having sexual relations with women?

136
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What was the meaning behind it?

137
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,000
This is the meaning behind it:

138
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
They said that a woman is death.

139
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
When I strived sometimes, and would suffer back then

140
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:33,000
And being in the wilderness though I didn’t catch much because I liked being in the wilderness better

141
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I would sometimes think when I couldn’t catch anything:

142
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,000
“Well now, was it for my hunting

143
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,900
“That I was told like this that a woman is death?”

144
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Because I was mischievous, I did various [mischievous] things.

145
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,900
I used to think, “Well now, was this why they admonished me

146
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,900
“Because I would be unable to catch these things I was hunting in the wilderness?”

147
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,900
I told you the truth. I was mischievous.

148
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
In my observation, an obedient person lives well.

149
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:28,000
It’s clear who obeys what their parents say and lives well.

150
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,900
[S]he also doesn’t seem to be in need of anything.

151
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
It’s because [s]he listens to the traditional wisdom [s]he heard.

152
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Someone like me who does not obey traditional is wisdom is like me

153
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,900
Always in need of things.

154
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,900
In my opinion, this Yup’ik wisdom

155
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Is no different from what the Bible says.

156
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,900
It’s because the dear ancestors of old would talk about the Spirit of the Universe.

157
00:14:15,000 --> 000:14:24,000
It corresponded with the origin of the Bible, our unseen Heavenly Father.

158
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It corresponded with that.

159
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,000
Though the poor people didn’t know, they called it the Spirit of the Universe.

160
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
They also said that the Spirit of the Universe would tell us to repent.

161
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,900
My poor teacher would especially say

162
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That I should never under any circumstances make fun of anyone struggling.

163
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I should instead help whomever is unable.

164
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
He said that a person’s mind is powerful.

165
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This is what he would say.

166
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,000
It is true.

167
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It seems that in all the land, though we don’t have the same language, our traditional wisdom is one.

168
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,900
But many people also don’t adhere to them anymore.

169
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It’s because we who have become elders do not speak anymore.

170
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It’s like it’s dead because no one talks about it.

171
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But youpl have started doing this

172
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And I am thankful when I see people speaking [traditional wisdom] on what they call the TV.

173
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I am not doing well right now.

174
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Because we of Urucararmiut around here grew up watching Caucasians

175
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,500
Because we started observing them, we are not like those around us.

176
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But because those around us watched well

177
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,900
And because they would always sleep in the community house

178
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
From what I heard back when I was a boy

179
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The boys wouldn’t sleep in houses, only in the community house.

180
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,000
Also, from what I heard about the community house back then

181
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Before dawn, because one of the elders would always speak

182
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,900
In the darkness when they woke up.

183
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:57,900
It seems that our ancestors back then lived well though they weren’t frivolous.

184
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
These days, we have become frivolous like this.

185
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We weren’t like this

186
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,900
Nothing was taken lightly.

187
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,500
And food, Western food was not in excess.

188
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
It seems that it was always scarce.

189
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
These days, those planes bring us cargo every day.

190
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:32,000
Back then, they would only bring them cargo twice, in the spring and fall.

191
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It would bring stuff all the way to the mouth of the Kuskokwim, and what they call Canineq down there.

192
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Only two barges in the spring, fall.

193
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's why those Yupiit of old, no matter who they were, even Caucasians.

194
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
They carefully watched and didn’t take things lightly.

195
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Our ancestors back then wouldn’t talk about Western things, only mines.

196
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
They would call the Western thing a mine, and they would talk about old mines.

197
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
They didn’t speak too much about Western things here in my observation.

198
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,900
This is what I think they did:

199
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Those Caucasians were looking to make money back then.

200
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There were not many jobs at that time.

201
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Though they always fished, this fish was their currency, and wasn’t it expensive?

202
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Once in my observation, two chums like this cost two quarters.

203
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But things were not expensive at that time.

204
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But Western things were scarce.

205
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There weren’t many Western things, not like now.

206
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
They also had lights with what they called kerosene

207
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Only when it got dark.

208
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The poor people I saw back then did not take anything lightly.

209
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But they lived seemingly in fear that this Yup’ik food would become scarce.

210
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,900
My instructor also used to tell me not to sleep during food gathering season.

211
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He said that I had a lot of time to sleep all winter.

212
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,900
But I didn’t obey him because I was mischievous.

213
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,900
Though I fish, we are not like that these days, at least most of us.

214
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,900
Well, my time is nigh.

215
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,900
It’s almost time for me to go on air.

216
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,900
In the church, when I started trying to go to church after I quit drinking alcohol

217
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,000
After I quit drinking alcohol, I tried to go to church though I felt very constrained.

218
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I tried not to miss any Sundays.

219
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Are you still a bell-ringer today?

220
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
One day, one of them invited me to work in the church.

221
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Though he asked me, I refused him at first

222
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Because I felt constrained since I abused alcohol so heavily.

223
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But when I first started trying to go to church back then, I would sometimes be invited

224
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:06,000
He would ask me, not all the time, for me to help in the church over there.

225
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
One day, I answered him

226
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Thinking that I didn’t want to do it for long, I said to him

227
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
…I didn’t [?] him [?] the church.

228
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
They also used to pay me $50 per month.

229
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,000
And then eventually, they gave me a raise to $100 per month.

230
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
In my opinion

231
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
When I thought about my past because I remember it
