1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:06,330
In the winter, when I went with my late father to the wilderness when it was cold

2
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:09,873
I got frostbitten and I didn’t realize it.

3
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:12,794
When he saw me, he said that my cheeks got frostbitten.

4
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:23,624
He took snow from there, pressed it against my cheeks, and the snow melted.

5
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:29,296
When it had been some time, he stopped.

6
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:37,667
And then the skin from my cheeks didn’t, you know, peel off.

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,864
But that’s what I know about how that happens.

8
00:00:44,465 --> 00:00:52,165
But I think it would be good to be submerged into cold water if they get frostbitten on their feet or hands.

9
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:57,168
It probably won’t be any different from getting it here on the cheeks.

10
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:06,710
It probably won’t be any different if they get frostbitten on their hands or feet and they are submerged into cold water.

11
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:12,484
They will probably be good if they are submerged.

12
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,084
They say it will suddenly get cold when that happens.

13
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:37,028
They say that the sun is "ready" when it’s going to be cold.

14
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:43,456
When it’s cold, when it’s going to get cold, that’s what they said it was like.

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:54,494
It would be as if it were wearing an outer parka, and wearing gloves on the outside with white parts.

16
00:01:55,931 --> 00:02:04,669
They said that it will get cold. That probably happens when it’s going to be cold for a while.

17
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:05,873
For a long time?

18
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:13,205
I think it's like that. They said that it would be like that.

19
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:17,276
Don't they also say that they would use the mountains for weather forecasts?

20
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:22,842
The mountains also, since some of them were observant

21
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:34,363
Because I'm not observant, when those mountains across there do something, when there are mirages on the horizon

22
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:38,383
They say that it's a sign of some kind of weather.

23
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:50,133
But when the mountains across are high, and some of them have sharp summits, I think that’s a sign of warm weather.

24
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:38,277
I see the mountain across there with the sharp summit, and it’s visible from here.

25
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:46,292
And when I used to live up in Qanirtuum Qagatii over there, it would be visible with a sharp summit.

26
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:52,239
When it’s going to be warm, I use it as a sign.

27
00:03:52,581 --> 00:04:01,319
When the summit seems to get sharper and rise acting strangely, it seems to do that when it’s going to get warm.

28
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:15,055
The observant ones back then would know, the people of old back then.

29
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,228
When they used to survive with various tools, because they were always outside

30
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:29,663
And those who use them know to use the stars at night as signs of incoming weather.

31
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:34,522
There is probably no one who does that now.

32
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:41,791
I’m not sure. Some young people who were told can probably do that.

33
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:12,172
Those observant ones were indeed like weather forecasters.

34
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:18,893
They knew through their signs, how they gauged the signs

35
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:22,657
Through the stars or how the weather was like.

36
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,802
They knew what the weather was going to be like.

37
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:33,536
Some of those who believed in them would follow them.

38
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:41,316
And then the squirrels in the mountains across there, one of them also told me a story

39
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:49,840
He said that when the weather is going to be bad for a long while, their cheeks have a lot in them.

40
00:05:50,736 --> 00:06:01,086
They fill them with berries or other things they eat, go to their dens, then eat from the stores in their cheeks for as long as the weather is bad.

41
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,651
They stay there in the den with food.

42
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,105
What were storyknives made of?

43
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:28,360
I had a storyknive made out of ivory, tuluq, ivory.

44
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:30,620
And I’m not sure who made it.

45
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:33,873
I would never stop telling storyknife stories.

46
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:44,309
And since we had friends, we would only tell storyknife stories with our friends when we weren’t in school.

47
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:54,240
We would tell storyknife stories, and the villages from my friend’s and my storyknife stories would have names.

48
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:57,448
They had names as we pretended they were inland.

49
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,168
We had them pretend to be a family.

50
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:08,495
My playmate would name these the inlanders.

51
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:16,656
These would be the Tundra People, and she would have the Coastal People always be over here.

52
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:22,577
She would name that village and the people the Tundra People.

53
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:27,116
We would make up families and give them houses.

54
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:31,913
Would they have things? Would they have names?

55
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:40,867
We would pretend that they would have things like what we’ve seen. They would have normal things.

56
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:48,867
And when we didn’t tell storyknife stories, we played string games.

57
00:07:52,383 --> 00:08:03,858
But they would admonish us against playing string games for too long saying that an elf would enter to whomever is playing string games.

58
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,893
We wouldn’t do it for long, but stop after playing some string games.

59
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:13,119
Why?

60
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:14,840
I don’t know.

61
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:21,273
And in the summer, we would play with small dolls.

62
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:26,588
We had small dolls, almost every girl.

63
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:36,363
They would have a lot of small dolls. These would make up a small family.

64
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:43,715
And then these other dolls. Those were the toys we had.

65
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:03,350
When my father was going to travel

66
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:17,429
My mother would prepare food for him, tea, sugar. They always had things to cook with.

67
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:26,682
But when the weather was good, those men would cook outdoors.

68
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,621
Would they hunt for their own food?

69
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:35,587
Yes.

70
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:44,293
And then I would find that they would make drift nets out of string.

71
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:55,810
My father would also carve wood for fishing tools. He would make blackfish traps.

72
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:04,781
The men I’ve seen would also make conical traps for land animals, adding in steel traps.

73
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:35,897
When the other villages they invited arrived, they would take the men to the community house.

74
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:41,719
And they would place one of the benches and put it high up near the exit.

75
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:47,255
And they would seat the men there and bring them food.

76
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:50,595
They would call it bringing them food.

77
00:10:51,903 --> 00:11:00,290
They would bring them cooked food to eat, or dried fish along with tea.

78
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:05,831
And then they would try to disrupt their meals when they started eating.

79
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:14,278
When those visiting men started eating, the village would start drumming a song.

80
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:18,828
They called it disrupting their meals.

81
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:25,912
I sat and watched my grandfathers and great-uncles, the last one, that was the last one.

82
00:11:26,872 --> 00:11:33,647
I observed and watched my father’s uncle from Paingaq.

83
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:40,748
The villagers would sing for them like this to disrupt their meals

84
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:45,375
So they can choke, or can’t swallow, or something like that.

85
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,176
They sang to them like this:

86
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:57,329
"Let me make those who do not get embarrassed become undecided

87
00:11:57,692 --> 00:12:04,728
"Do I lump in everyone who’s undecided?

88
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:24,058
"Don’t these people from Akuluraq also want to sing repeatedly, scattering nothing of value here?

89
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,617
"They also want to repeatedly sing."

90
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:40,232
But the two naked men who sang the verses, with necklaces here, headdresses, but with pants, would do this.

91
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:48,637
And then they would specifically point them out, "Even if those out there think they’re important."

92
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:51,813
Oh my, they were frightening.

93
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,448
They called that disrupting their meals.

94
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:18,662
I didn’t choose my own husband.

95
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,585
My caretaker chose for me.

96
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:31,200
Because the people were respectful and deferential to each other, I don’t know to whom I was starting to love.

97
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:38,864
But they told us to obey our spouses if we wanted to be good spouses.

98
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:44,679
When I took care of my husband, or when I was married to him

99
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:54,106
I like mutually respecting each other, not treating each other badly.

100
00:13:55,733 --> 00:14:04,869
And before my husband started working, I would try to take good care of what little he caught

101
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:09,005
Well, the animals that he caught.

102
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:43,636
Divorcing now, however, the young people are getting worse because they marry husbands they chose themselves

103
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:48,581
Because their parents don’t choose for them, instead marrying whomever they want.

104
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:59,818
And they divorce because they choose their own without listening to their parents.

105
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:01,663
What about alcohol?

106
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:08,613
And this alcohol, in my observation, there is more alcohol recently.

107
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:16,378
And for married couples, if the husband drinks alcohol and the wife doesn’t

108
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:22,519
The wife will want the husband to get better.

109
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:29,216
She will want her husband to stop drinking alcohol.

110
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:36,546
If a woman knows God and prays

111
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:41,406
God will hear what she asks for, and her husband will stop drinking alcohol.

112
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:48,552
Or with married couples, if the husband drinks and the wife doesn’t

113
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:58,373
If she joins her husband, they will destroy each other, destroy each other and fight each other, then divorce.

114
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,812
I see many married couples who also love their children.

115
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:37,444
That one thing is what is destroying married couples these days.

116
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:49,067
You know we see people do various things when they’re drunk. They are not ashamed, and make love to this random woman.

117
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,635
It’s because they’re not ashamed anymore.

118
00:16:52,981 --> 00:17:06,181
If they give it up, believing in their hearts, if they give it up in their hearts, they can get better.

119
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:12,152
And they can become better than we who have never drank alcohol in our lives.

120
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:30,942
If a person wants to live well

121
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:38,419
He can live well by obeying his parents.

122
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:44,905
We who are parents will not instruct our children like this:

123
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:49,536
"When you go out, misbehave." No, we will not tell them that.

124
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,030
We all want our children to be good.

125
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:03,820
Also, these young people who are married today

126
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:14,740
When they don’t respect their husbands, or the men their wives, or the women their husbands, it destroys them.

127
00:18:15,604 --> 00:18:20,038
They disparage each other and consider themselves as more important.

128
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:24,422
I would hear this when I took a husband:

129
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:34,548
They said that even if our husbands are ugly or crippled, no matter what they’re like, we must respect them and not treat them badly.

130
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:46,783
And how married couples are getting worse these days, they also choose their own husbands without examining what they’re like

131
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:53,780
It because they have good faces, but their dispositions are bad.

132
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:58,443
That is what keeps them from having good marraiges.

133
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:02,815
Long ago, they used to instruct people

134
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:11,296
They said that even if a person was ugly, to marry him even if he had an ugly face, saying that he will take good care of her.

135
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,643
It turned out to be true.

136
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:23,567
These days in married couples, they are becoming bad because they treat their husbands or these boys very badly.

137
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:28,826
They don’t know because they don’t hear this traditional wisdom.

138
00:19:52,354 --> 00:20:03,804
They told us to be careful of our mouths towards those around us. They also told us not to live by saying harsh words just because we have mouths.

139
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:15,032
They said that those who are bad people come to shame many times along with those who say too many harsh words.

140
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:24,646
They say that they are seen in different ways, and then as they want to be.

141
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:37,112
And then they would tell us to try to stay quiet even if we are blamed if we didn’t do it.

142
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,653
That was also an admonishment.

143
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:52,688
And then we would be admonished against going after people too much.

144
00:20:53,067 --> 00:21:02,954
They said that we would come to times of mental hardship or keep hearing of bad things.

145
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:10,991
This is what we were told.

146
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:31,619
Also, they told us not to invite our families into saying things about them because that also brings discord.

147
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:07,231
I would be told that I am no longer a child, that I’ve become a woman.

148
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:15,935
But they said that I should always take things to wash them.

149
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:26,050
And then they told me never to step over men’s clothes no matter what they were, nor fish.

150
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:33,479
They told me not to step over even food.

151
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:38,943
They say that we, you know, scatter impurity on them.

152
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:49,420
And then they told me not to keep my hair untied. They said that we drop and scatter impurity.

153
00:23:16,677 --> 00:23:25,017
And these two old men, one was at near the door at the very end

154
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:34,688
There was also one across there at the very end. They were bringing forth traditional wisdom.

155
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:44,905
Both of those who were talking about life ahead, after having the one toward here talk

156
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:51,900
After bringing up the things they had to say about how they should be

157
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:57,924
They talked about how they should live and be like this.

158
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:05,801
And then when he was finished, the one on the other side would correct him.

159
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,030
He said a person should live like this.

160
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:19,729
Even if they lived in the community house, were father, or had a lot of children, they didn’t disregard their traditional wisdom.

161
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:24,822
The community house would be quiet when they spoke.

162
00:24:51,859 --> 00:25:02,217
And then when I had a child, I was told to teach that child.

163
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:06,121
They said that chidlren do not forget.

164
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:21,310
And then they would admonish me against asking him questions, or asking him about what his peers are like.

165
00:25:22,964 --> 00:25:31,651
Also, do not defend them. You know how some are defensive?

166
00:25:31,706 --> 00:25:38,968
And then they told me not to defend him but to admonish him.

167
00:25:38,984 --> 00:25:49,871
They said that if I defend him, I will encourage him to lie and say false things.

168
00:25:50,118 --> 00:26:02,196
And then they would also admonish me against physically punishing them too much.

169
00:26:02,637 --> 00:26:05,375
They said that I would make him unstable.

170
00:26:06,754 --> 00:26:15,791
They said that we make them unstable by physically or verbally abusing them. They say that we make them impertinent.

171
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,915
They say that they make them impertinent like that.

172
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:32,213
It turns out that we must raise children to make them feel like we do not defend them.

173
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:43,321
They say that those who are defended and spoken to without thought make discord among their parents.

174
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:23,900
When they were done taking sweat baths and the fire down there had gone out, one of them would place the cover on the smoke hole of the community house.

175
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:35,967
And then after they close it, the men would sit naked like this without having put on clothes when we come in. They were probably drying off.

176
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:43,878
The people of Aagurmiut and Urucararmiut had one community house.

177
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:52,292
Sometimes in the winter like this, when the people of Aagurmiut wanted to take sweat baths

178
00:27:52,953 --> 00:28:03,977
They would go to the community house together with sleds filled with wood though Kepenkuk down there when it used to be called Kepenkuk.

179
00:28:04,777 --> 00:28:12,727
They would go to the community house over there because Urucararmiut and what was Aagurmiut had one community house.

180
00:28:12,746 --> 00:28:15,796
It’s actually called Aagurmiut down there.

181
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:49,793
I started off completely prepared to be married.

182
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:59,360
But my late grandmother, and my mom, and my father would tell me

183
00:28:59,743 --> 00:29:03,456
That I should be careful with my spouse.

184
00:29:03,924 --> 00:29:14,949
Also, even if people say bad things about him, they told me not to tell him

185
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:25,243
Also, I have a companion, a male younger sibling.

186
00:29:25,424 --> 00:29:37,036
They also used to tell him that even if people say various things about his wife not to believe them if he hasn’t seen it with his own eyes.

187
00:29:37,198 --> 00:29:40,498
My father also used to tell me that.

188
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:50,800
He said that I should not suspect my spouse of various things if I haven’t done them.

189
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:54,790
I also shouldn’t accuse him of being with other women.

190
00:29:54,873 --> 00:30:00,985
He said that, you know, that brings discord.

191
00:30:01,006 --> 00:30:09,656
I was also told not to excessively tease my husband.

192
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:13,713
And then they would also tell me this:

193
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:20,911
Even if I have nothing or am short on things not to say that I have nothing.

194
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:28,475
They said that I would make my spouse’s mind be in turmoil.

195
00:30:28,632 --> 00:30:31,395
This is what I was told.

196
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:40,286
We were also admonished against always being suspicious of each other.

197
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,967
They said that those who are guilty are the ones who suspect their spouses.

198
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:24,999
I just told you about what I observed, that the community house inland was down toward the water from the Joe Lomack Building.

199
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:33,556
The place they called Urucaraq wasn’t a lake, was dry, but had a river.

200
00:31:34,443 --> 00:31:37,893
And the river had a bridge down there.

201
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:46,812
And the first school upriver, upriver over from the Moravian church, the old church.

202
00:31:47,218 --> 00:31:55,918
There were boardwalks made of plywood all the way to Aagurmiut down there to where they called Luqinquq.

203
00:31:56,637 --> 00:31:59,012
Luqinquq had a store there.

204
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:08,331
He had a Caucasian companion with a house toward the water from him. He was probably his partner at the time. They called him Kassaussaaq.

205
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:15,106
It was because those people back then would give them whatever names suited them.

206
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:33,706
I grew up at the time without a lot of Caucasians here between Aagurmiut and Urucuaraq.

207
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:36,869
They also talked about Kenirkauyar over there.

208
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:42,432
And Kenirkauyar was a Western dancing hall here.

209
00:32:42,445 --> 00:32:47,632
But it wasn’t at any time, only on Saturdays.

210
00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:53,257
They also went until 12 o’clock.

211
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:59,270
That was when they stopped, and they didn’t let them do it all the time.

212
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:05,826
They would have us go back to our villages at midnight and admonish us against wandering about.

213
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:17,945
You see, the first Caucasians back then also seemed to help each other like Yupiit.

214
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:27,989
Even if we were Yup’ik, even the Caucasians would admonish us.

215
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:57,552
They say that those who are defended and spoken to without respect bring discord to their parents.

216
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:06,678
That’s what I used to be told, and that’s what my mother told me.

217
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:21,891
And no matter what, when I sometimes was fed up, she would admonish me not to talk about those.

218
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:27,153
She said that I would be the cause of discord among people.

219
00:34:27,497 --> 00:34:41,597
And then she said that no matter what they do, she admonished me against coming home crying.

220
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:49,091
And then even if I never did that

221
00:34:49,410 --> 00:35:03,022
When my children would come in crying when they were small, my father would tell me that because he said I needed it.

222
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:09,485
And then I would not run away, but stay because I thought that I did.

223
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:29,258
And then when children are admonished like this for the benefit of their futures, it turns out they do not run away but stop when they are told to.

224
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:34,042
And do not say this to them: "I will take care of him."

225
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:41,088
Children who are treated like that learn to go home crying.

226
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,789
And then the ones that they keep defending

227
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:58,179
That’s why it’s admonished against, because it leads to lying and saying things without consideration.

228
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:31,259
They also told us to help those who looked destitute and who were unable.

229
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:38,615
They also told us never to make fun of anyone even if they look funny.

230
00:36:39,015 --> 00:36:40,648
That is probably bad.

231
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:50,560
Instead, they told us to help the older ones who were unable.

232
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,103
They say a person’s mind is powerful.

233
00:36:57,742 --> 00:37:10,864
Also, even if we enter another house, my teacher would tell me to never take even a single match or nail from that house.

234
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:14,060
How much more time?

235
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:25,017
He also said that even in the wilderness, a person doesn’t forget what he put, even in the wilderness.

236
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:28,104
That must be true.

237
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:34,813
He said that a person doesn’t forget what he put even in the wilderness.

238
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:03,030
And when we were in the marshes over there in the summer like this

239
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:07,987
When our feet wouldn’t get cold and we started walking around barefoot

240
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:18,366
When our feet were itchy at night, we would take out our feet to our bedding and they would start bleeding.

241
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:22,271
And we didn’t use them as an excuse when they told us to travel.

242
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:27,285
When we stepped into water, they would sometimes sting.

243
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:36,957
This was the only way we walked, and they became raw, and they became raw between the toes.

244
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:46,115
When we went to the wilderness, we would pull something out and bandage the part that was bleeding too much.

245
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:52,118
And we lived without making any excuses but were quiet.

246
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:58,934
We lived without any discord in the house.

247
00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:09,641
And then when we and our younger siblings almost made too much noise having fun, they would admonish us against acting foolish.

248
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:30,118
There were four in what is called a family in English.

249
00:39:30,804 --> 00:39:38,748
That big family had that house as they were supposed to.

250
00:39:38,905 --> 00:39:43,327
Also, when they stayed in that house like this

251
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:58,701
These food to eat, those familes weren't the only ones to have them, but everyone in the house would eat from what food they had.

252
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:10,774
Some of them have houses, and the ones trying to survive would stay in one house that they own.

253
00:40:10,856 --> 00:40:16,367
But they always had a lot of people.

254
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:23,695
These familes with several members would live in a house, only those families.

255
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:27,129
That’s what they were like.

256
00:40:27,137 --> 00:40:38,715
And their food that they get from the wilderness, blackfish, saffron cods, or whatever food they get in the winter and fall for frozen raw fish

257
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:53,163
The yweren’t food for only the ones in the house or the ones who caught them, but for everyone in the house along with the men in the community house.

258
00:41:20,066 --> 00:41:29,166
These days, because the old life of the people long ago has changed

259
00:41:29,332 --> 00:41:37,477
Since it’s like we Yupiit have started living a new life unlike our traditional life

260
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:45,654
Because our young people are going to completely forget our original lifestyle

261
00:41:45,665 --> 00:41:59,604
We show them the kinds of houses that we used to have when we were growing up that the workers have finished

262
00:41:59,637 --> 00:42:06,503
Because we absolutely should not lose the original lifestyle of our Yup’ik people.

263
00:42:06,632 --> 00:42:15,610
Also, we absolutely should not leave our young people in ignorance, because it is our ancient way as Yupiit.

264
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,449
Because it is so sad.

265
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:25,924
Now, we look at our young people and want them to return and learn it.

266
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:34,591
And even though we only instruct them with words, because they seem to doubt it because they’ve never seen it

267
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:41,258
Let them see these houses they used to have long ago as true

268
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:48,808
And the thigns we were born in time to see before Western things became available.

269
00:42:48,815 --> 00:42:59,004
Now, they are working to show our young people so that they can learn from them.

270
00:43:15,113 --> 00:43:23,457
When thye went to their winter camps like this

271
00:43:23,502 --> 00:43:35,002
When they were finished, they would split wood to make fish traps out of stright-graned pieces of wood.

272
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:42,146
That’s what they also used to do.

273
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:55,977
Since these young people of ours, even if they’re not young, are too ignorant about what to do, lashing fish traps, and making fish traps

274
00:43:56,126 --> 00:44:05,926
We don’t want their lives to be like that anymore now.

275
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:17,807
Lashing fishing tools for blackfish and loche.

276
00:44:19,165 --> 00:44:32,982
They measure, you know, the size of the fish, and lash traps for sticklebacks.

277
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:41,120
Their women would also make grass baskets to hold fish, but not out of empty sacks.

278
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:49,615
They would gather wheat grass to make baskets to hold caught fish so them wouldn’t be without containers.

279
00:44:50,014 --> 00:45:00,048
That is what the people I was born in time to see were like.

280
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:19,611
The people back then would gauge it by the snow.

281
00:45:19,688 --> 00:45:30,285
When there’s a lot of snow, and also when there’s a lot of ice where the snow is partially frozen

282
00:45:30,468 --> 00:45:35,190
When it freezes as it periodically warms up.

283
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:43,059
They say that when there’s a lot of snow also upriver from us, there’s a lot of water. They would say there’s a lot of water.

284
00:45:43,376 --> 00:45:50,143
Did you see the snowiest time when there was a lot of snow?

285
00:45:50,154 --> 00:45:55,143
There used to be a lot of snow here back when we were small. There was a lot of snow.

286
00:45:55,322 --> 00:45:59,322
And the houses down there, the mission house was the only elevated one.

287
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:04,330
It would reach their roof and slope down.

288
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:07,699
We would go up there and slide.

289
00:46:07,816 --> 00:46:14,038
And they would shovel tunnels to the doors of the porches like this.

290
00:46:30,783 --> 00:46:35,028
Did you observe a lot of snow on the Yukon or anywhere?

291
00:46:35,046 --> 00:46:40,513
Yes, there used to be a lot of snow in the 1930’s when I was a boy.

292
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:51,452
Sometimes, when it keeps snowing with repeated southern winds, they say that the marsh freezes, cirmiggluni as they say.

293
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:59,334
Now, even though there’s snow, the tundra here is not frozen.

294
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:06,387
Even though there’s a lot of snow like this, there’s not a flood of water even though there’s a lot.

295
00:47:06,396 --> 00:47:10,796
But the melted ice is slow to flow out.

296
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:17,803
They say that the water will be gone probably when it repeatedly freezes.

297
00:47:19,023 --> 00:47:25,107
But when there’s a lot of ice that can’t do that, then there is a flood of water.

298
00:47:25,117 --> 00:47:30,595
Also, when these rivers have a lot of snow, the ice isn’t thick.

299
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:40,198
Because it’s not as thick as it usually is, even if there’s a lot of water, I don’t think there’ll be a flood for that reason.

300
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:08,769
With how February is ending now, how would they prepare to go to their spring camps?

301
00:48:08,787 --> 00:48:13,354
When they were going to go to their spring camps, they would start preparing in April.

302
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,678
And prepare food supplies for the entire spring

303
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,290
And setting up their tents, and...

304
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:25,872
See, I’ll slip into English a lot.

305
00:48:26,913 --> 00:48:33,813
And, you know, they would bring their boats and canoes.

306
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,325
They brought the things they would need in the spring camps.

307
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:47,009
And then when the middle of April had passed, we would relocate.

308
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:54,260
We would arrive to our settlement. It was nice and wonderful.

309
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:27,497
This was the traditional wisdom passed to us: they told us to respect especially the land and water.

310
00:49:29,695 --> 00:49:31,306
Respect it.

311
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:43,098
This is what our instruction was like: respect it as much as our bowls.

312
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:47,603
It’s not like that these days. It’s different.

313
00:49:49,881 --> 00:49:52,970
What does it mean, "as much as our bowls?"

314
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:55,679
This is how I understand it:

315
00:49:56,859 --> 00:50:06,570
Our bowls when we eat, at least back then, it’s probably because a person long ago would have only one bowl and personally kept it.

316
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,053
he treated it with love and respect.

317
00:50:11,495 --> 00:50:21,706
I think that that’s a metaphor, to respect our land and water as much as our bowls.

318
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:26,965
This is part of the traditional wisdom of the people long ago.
