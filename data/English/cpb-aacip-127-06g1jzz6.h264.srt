1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
This... youpl¬ [?].

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,500
And [s]he also brought up a little about it.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:14,000
But the topic of our meeting here
is traditional wisdom about walking staffs.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,900
Everyone needs this [naturally] grown tool.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,900
They also told me back when I was a boy

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,900
That I should not travel to the wilderness without a staff.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,900
And the next, my paternal uncle, was supposed to be here

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But Elataaq probably didn’t come in.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
They’re good. They’re talking about good things.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,000
And they almost talk about what we work on here

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,000
We who are called search and rescue.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,500
Concerning us [our organization], that’s not what we are.

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Many people who want to can join even if they don’t have the title.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They can help us.

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:29,500
So, first of all, I am thankful for this.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It was like it was our ears all winter.

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,000
Before they told us anything, we wouldn’t know anything.

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:55,000
Despite that, I also hear about them through CB radios

19
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:04,000
But before I hear about it from these two, I leave that alone.

20
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,500
I am like a helper for them2.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
When they2 say something, we2 make calls to our surrounding [villages]

22
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,000
[S]he, my child, and I helping each other.

23
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,000
It’s good that [s]he’s taken care of us all winter.

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,000
It truly seems that [s]he goes ahead of our struggles

25
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,000
Telling the villages outside of here

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,500
When we lose someone from here.

27
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,900
But [s]he lets our surrounding villages know

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Bringing what the willing will need

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So that we who will go do not have to.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It truly seems [s]he’s like a helper.

31
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,000
In the past, [s]he would always go with us

32
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,500
But [s]he didn’t do that all winter.

33
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,000
But in my observation, [s]he worked harder than we did.

34
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,000
[S]he lets us who are called search and rescue know everything [she can].

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I am very thankful for all of this person’s help…

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
…saying to pull him in, that he will be heavy.

37
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,000
If I have a companion and [s]he falls into the water

38
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,000
If [s]he cannot be taken and is in danger

39
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,000
They said that I can throw that at him and take him.

40
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:22,000
Also, when I take him, I should also bring him to a grassy area

41
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:32,000
Take off his clothes, wring them, [put] grass [inside] and put them on him,
insulating them with grass.

42
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,000
They say that grass is warm.

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,500
[S]he used to say that they’re warm.

44
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,500
That’s why last fall, upriver from the airport

45
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:53,500
They used to bring Arthur’s child out of the water who had fallen in.

46
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,000
But he would sink again, unable to come out of the water.

47
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,000
They would have been able to take him had they had some rope
from what the ones2 who told me the story said.

48
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,000
I remembered that traditional wisdom that was told to me.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We have a lot of lessons, lessons that we heard.

50
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,500
We young people who have grandfathers,
our grandfather’s traditional wisdom.

51
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:31,000
Also, if we come to the outskirts of a village in the fall, he would say to me:

52
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,000
If I come to the outskirts of a village and see an elevated place

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I should go to it, climb, and look around me

54
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,500
I should look around the village to notify them [of my presence].

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,500
I should thoroughly observe this elevated area,
and these [other] elevated areas, and the lakes around them.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They said that they will save me
if the weather turns bad and I do not forget them.

57
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,500
But I’ve never done that.

58
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
It’s because I forgot them back then.

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sometimes, though, I knew them.

60
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,500
And then [s]he would say to me:

61
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,000
A self-confident person only comes upon misfortune

62
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,500
Someone they call cacetulria.

63
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:43,000
However, [s]he said that someone who isn’t self-confident
does not come upon too much misfortune.

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Indeed, I have experienced that.

65
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because I’m scared by nature, I’ve become this old
before coming upon any misfortune.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Only a single time in the winter around this time

67
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,500
When Alba downriver and I went returned together after coming here

68
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:18,000
[S]he wanted me to camp close to Kwigillingok downriver.

69
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:24,000
I told him that I would go down, that the village was close.

70
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,000
Because I became confused just as we reached the village

71
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,000
My companion and I stopped and I said to him,

72
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
“We should stop without continuing further”

73
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
Because there was a blizzard blowing outside.

74
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,000
Apparently, we had stopped right inland from the village.

75
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:55,000
In the morning, I looked out when it was getting bright
to find a school in front of me.

76
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I’m thankful for what the person before me talked about.

77
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
I can’t add a lot to them.

78
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I’m also thankful because I had thought that
I wouldn’t be standing here before youpl.

79
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:37,000
I’m surprised and thankful that I’m now standing before you¬pl.

80
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,900
I have nothing else to say

81
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:52,000
Except that I’m thankful as he said.

82
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I had moved from here last year, going downriver to Napakiak

83
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:10,000
But when I hear about anything, I can’t stay still.

84
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,000
I always have to call with the CB radios.

85
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I also listen for him to request help.

86
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:39,000
And downriver, two of us encourage others

87
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Encouraging our2 fellows downriver.

88
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,000
I’m thankful that he inspires us to follow.

89
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,000
But when he calls…

90
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,000
Fred is a good leader to us, along with this…

91
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
…about mushing dogs.

92
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:17,000
But these men and the older ones know more than we2 do.

93
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,000
But because they’ve asked us2 to

94
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:29,000
We’re2 going to talk about dogs, dog mushing,
as we2 were asked to do.

95
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,000
You see, the people I was born in time to see back then
didn’t have a lot of dogs.

96
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:44,000
Also, it seemed that someone who had a lot of dogs seemed to have five
from what I’ve seen.

97
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
They also took care of and loved those dogs like real people.

98
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,000
And some of them didn’t seem to be leashed at all in the porch.

99
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,000
They would huddle in the porch all together.

100
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Didn’t they ever even fight?

101
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,000
And then when it was time like this,
the people back then would tell stories

102
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They say that a long time ago, they had dogs that when they pushed sleds

103
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
They would leash them2 to the side here.

104
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,500
They got help from their dogs as they utilized them.

105
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,500
Back a long time ago, they tried to have them help.

106
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,000
And our elders would say this, also when I started mushing dogs:

107
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,000
Only its stomach makes a dog a mushing dog.

108
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
That is probably true.

109
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,500
Only its stomach makes a dog a mushing dog

110
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,000
Because it strengthens the flesh for all of us.

111
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,500
We Yupiit also know that

112
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:09,000
When our stomachs are empty, we’re not happy, and smile so little.

113
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I also used hear about dogs a long time ago

114
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,500
That that one over there has a great leader and is obedient.

115
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:29,000
And when I hear about some dogs like that, they would say

116
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
That that person’s lead dog is very smart.

117
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,500
No matter what, even in a blizzard, it brings its owner where he wants.

118
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,600
Is that true?

119
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,000
Yes, that’s what it is.

120
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,000
I also thought that dogs had minds like me.

121
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Because I’m doubtful, when the dog helped,
I was very thankful for that dog.

123
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Look, since a long time ago…

124
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,500
…as a boy, I traveled to go hunt
because there were people in the hunting ground there

125
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
And it was the only house.

126
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,000
I was overconfident because I would have companions when I went
and I was scared by nature.

127
00:13:22:100 --> 00:13:28,000
I arrived at the house to find that they had gone just ahead of me.

128
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,000
Back when we only survived by eating food from the land

129
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:39,500
We would also hunt for minks back then
when the weather outside became like this.

130
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We weren’t sedentary because of them.

131
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,000
We also lost sleep to try to catch those in the spring like this.

132
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
When I got there, I thought,

133
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,000
“Let anything that wants to harm me do it.”

134
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,000
I forsook myself.

135
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,000
Let anything that wants to harm me do it.

136
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh my, because I was so scared, I brought my lead dog inside
to accompany me.

137
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It was my companion to keep me from being scared.

138
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,000
It was the only thing to boost my morale.

139
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:23,000
As I was laying down when I was full,
my dog was laying face down down in front of me.

140
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
At some point of this night

141
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,900
We used to have oil lamps back then that had wicks

142
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,500
Some with three, and some with four.

143
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
It would seem very bright.

144
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
That was an oil lamp.

145
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,500
It would seem very bright to me.

146
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
My goodness, my heart was filled with fear.

147
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,000
With the dog as my source of confidence, I said,

148
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
“Like us, but these dogs are probably smarter than we are.”

149
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
As I was there, I noticed that my dog

150
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,000
Had already started rocking the door back and forth.

151
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,000
My goodness, it truly seemed that it was interacting with something.

152
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:15,000
I thought, “As expected, something is going to happen to me now.”

153
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
My goodness, I stayed still.

154
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:25,000
As I was there, you see, something that look like a white cold draft
was slowly coming inside.

155
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And when it had come in a certain distance, it contracted and went out.

156
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,000
I suddenly thought, “The next time, it’ll go further.”

157
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,000
And my dog started becoming walking about here.

158
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,500
It was obviously scared like me. It was scared.

159
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,000
The next time, I saw that it was getting worse

160
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,000
Even waving its nose, almost barking.

161
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Eventually, you see, the draft was coming inside.

162
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,000
It came in quite a bit reaching the middle.

163
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:08,500
When it extracted, my dog dog went up behind me.

164
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:16,000
It put its snout into my spine behind me and stayed.

165
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
When that draft went toward the door, when it went out

166
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,000
My dog behind me pushed my back with its snout.

167
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,000
I thought, “This [dog] is probably asking me to go out.”

168
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,000
My goodness, after I had tried to stay

169
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,500
My sleeping mat, and after I put on my parka

170
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:53,000
I rolled up and bound my sleeping mat,
put on my hood, and went out.

171
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:02,000
[Qakugcaq] toward the door, there was a cloth hanging out by the entrance.

172
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,000
The exit going outside, however, was a real door.

173
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,000
When I was going to go out, when I put on my hood

174
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I blew out those2 lamps2 in a circle.

175
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
I turned them off.

176
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,900
My goodness, I estimated [the size of] the door going out.

177
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
When I reached that cloth,
I was afraid that I would run into the [qakugcaq].

178
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,000
My goodness, before I did, I went out.

179
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,500
When I went out, this way, and I probably did it the wrong way

180
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,000
I think people told them to go around clockwise.

181
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,000
And I didn’t look around, only beneath me in case I tripped.

182
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,500
When I went around it, I never saw the area around me.

183
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I spread out my dogs because I only had three.

184
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:10,000
When I spread them out, my lead dog came
and went where the lead dog would go.

185
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,000
When I put the harnesses2 on its head

186
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:20,500
It put these2 on by itself
without being told to and crouched.

187
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,500
And then after they2 were harnessed, I didn’t look around

188
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,500
Only watching what was in front of me.

189
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,000
My goodness, I mushed them when I finished [preparing] them.

190
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,900
I started going like a snowgo because [it was so fast].

191
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
My goodness, I was so scared that the [qakugcaq]
would take me from behind.

192
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,500
I was amazed at my dog.

193
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,000
It was of great help to me then.

194
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,000
It pushed me, obviously wanting me to go out.

195
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,500
You men know what dog mushing is like.

196
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I’ve always heard

197
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,500
That its stomach is what makes a dog a mushing dog.

198
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Also, these dogs that have litters raise and love them.

199
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,500
And then when it’s time we utilize them,
teaching them how to be sled dogs.

200
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,500
Eventually, they learn like we do.

201
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
They know how to do things, know where to go,

202
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,000
And they know where to stop to take us to our hunting grounds.

203
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This is all I’m going to say.

204
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It apparently hurt or killed someone.

205
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,500
Back when I was a boy, I never heard about those.

206
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But we have started hearing about that now.

207
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:11,500
And because I have my earliest memories inland in the Akula region

208
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,000
These dogs didn’t wander anywhere either.

209
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,000
Their owners kept them leashed.

210
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:26,500
Also, they always told us not to go near dogs
because they will bite us.

211
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
We who have become grandfathers

212
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:39,500
We pass that wisdom on to our grandchildren.

213
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,000
These dogs are apparently all different.

214
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:49,500
Some are friendly, and some are easily angered like me.

215
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,500
We must also remember that,

216
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,500
And we must teach it to our grandchildren here.

217
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,900
My grandchildren go to see my dogs down there

218
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,500
But I admonish them against treating them excessively.

219
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,000
I also tell them not to bother them.

220
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,500
I watch over them because they have this traditional wisdom:

221
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,000
Even when this dog doesn’t seem like the type, when the others do

222
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,000
It attacks people along with the others.

223
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,000
I cannot add a lot to that.

224
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:41,000
But now, I have youpl tentatively written down to stop at 2:30.

225
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,000
But we will wait for three o’clock for them.

226
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:53,900
At three o’clock, they will speak about subsistence.

227
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Youpl will take a break now.
