1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,660
How old are you?

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,730
About 78.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,230
(Who are you in Yup’ik?) Seventy...

4
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,335
Seventy-eight?

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,680
Who are you in Yup’ik?

6
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:14,695
I’m Ayagina’ar in Yup’ik.

7
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:28,905
Okay, so what kinds of admonished did you hear or find out about the river down there when it first freezes like this?

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:37,060
When it first freezes in the fall like this before it gets thick, the ice is dangerous.

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:44,170
Parts of it also freeze late, they freeze late.

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:52,900
It freezes late when it warms up periodically, and some freeze late even when it’s cold.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,020
Also, it’s still dangerously thin when it freezes.

12
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:06,375
A person cannot tell where it’s thin and dangerous.

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:17,290
But if he has a staff and examines the ice with that staff, he will know.

14
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:21,525
We were instructed on how to use this staff

15
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:30,035
That we should not be without it, especially in the fall when it’s dangerous like this, to examine the ice with.

16
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:38,620
Even if he’s in a hurry, after stopping and examining the place he’s curious about with that tool

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:46,760
He will know where it’s thin. He will know where it’s dangerous. His ice pick will show him.

18
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:55,945
So how cam a person who accidentally falls through the ice help himself?

19
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:03,630
This is what my father and other people used to tell me:

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:16,440
If he suddenly falls into the water and is floathing, that he should not go out right away, but try to keep the hole from closing up.

21
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:24,825
If it closes off and he tries to go out of the water right away, he will become weak.

22
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:29,635
But they said that he needs to be careful.

23
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:35,775
This is what my late father used to tell me: if it’s cold and I have gloves

24
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:46,305
After placing them on the ice here like this, slap them on the ice up there and let them freeze.

25
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,140
He said that a person can hold those and pull himself out.

26
00:02:50,470 --> 00:03:00,810
Also, he should take his legs out first, then hold this and roll, he must roll out of the water.

27
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:05,885
He can also save himself if the ice didn’t close in on him.

28
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:17,345
But if it closes in on him right away, he will suddenly become tired

29
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,460
If he tries to get out right away.

30
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:28,705
But, you know, they would instruct us to try to keep the hole from closing in on us.

31
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,310
But what will save him if he gets out safely?

32
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,270
In the cold like this before there is snow

33
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:49,460
When he gets out, he should take off his clothes right away if the land is close and there is grass visible.

34
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,980
He should take off his wet clothes and wring them.

35
00:03:56,155 --> 00:04:01,455
And put them on again, lining his body with grass.

36
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,670
Also, he must make calculated decisions if he’s getting cold

37
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:21,660
If he tries to urinate and drinks his urine, his own urine if he’s alone, or if there’s two of them, if he drinks his companions urine, whoever needs to urinate

38
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,790
They say a person will not freeze to death if he does that.

39
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:30,330
These young people must know that.

40
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:36,265
If he’s not repulsed and drinks his companion’s urine, they say he will not freeze to death.

41
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:43,400
Many used to do that. Those who used to do that would instruct that.

42
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,890
Does it also help to tell families before traveling?

43
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,740
What?

44
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:59,360
You know, telling people that he’s going to go to that place. How can that be of help to people?

45
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:09,945
Yes, a person can tell his family if he’s going to travel somewhere that he’s going to travel to someplace there.

46
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:19,275
If it’s past the time he should’ve came back, the people from his hometown will go first to where he wanted to go.

47
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:25,665
If they happen to come upon him without any misfortune if he doesn’t wander about

48
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,075
They will find him right away

49
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:32,615
If he doesn’t stray anywhere.

50
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:37,395
Anything else...

51
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:47,005
If people, these young people, know these instructions and adhere to them

52
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:52,375
These young people, especially now, do not know what they should do.

53
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:57,825
That’s why their parents must teach them about those

54
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,980
Always talking to them about dangerous things especially now in these dangerous times.

55
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,110
Also instruct them on these rivers.

56
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:16,170
Even though some rivers were thick, they quickly become dangerous when it warms up.

57
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:24,730
Then this staff as well, a person must not be without a staff when he’s traveling.

58
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,250
If he has a staff like that, he will know what parts are dangerous.

59
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:34,735
He will know which parts are dangerous with that staff he uses on the ice.

60
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,950
There are a lot of instructions that these young people are supposed to know.

61
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:46,025
But because we don’t speak abou tthem, our successors espcially do not know them

62
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,820
Because we do not teach them.

63
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,960
Long ago when we who are this age were growing up

64
00:06:57,265 --> 00:07:03,665
Because they men would be gathered in the community house alnog with the young boys

65
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:13,720
That’s why observant young people know those instructions.

66
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:17,515
A person uses these instructions as forewarning.

67
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,740
If he knows them, even if he gets into misfortune, he will be better and will not get into too much misfortune.

68
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:28,865
These young people should know them.

69
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,950
These elders talk about what they’ve experienced

70
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:48,040
They also talk about the things they’ve heard their elders say long ago so that these young people will use them well, so that they will live well.

71
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:53,275
So that they will live well including when they make their own living.

72
00:07:53,495 --> 00:08:03,345
If a young person knows it liek that, if he knows the instructions, he will be helping his life in the future

73
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:07,695
If he keeps examining those dangerous things.

74
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:17,170
These snowgoes do not know which way to travel, and they don’t know what’s dangerous.

75
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:24,720
But back when we had dogs, the dogs knew which places were dangerous.

76
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:33,440
That’s why when they’re traveling with snowgos, they should always examine it when they’re going to go down to the river.

77
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,160
It’s also easy to tell when previously unfrozen holes have frozen over.

78
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:51,475
And where it froze late if there has been windy for a long time, the places where the unfrozen holes splash out in the wind, their edges in the river are rough and higher.

79
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,620
Also, we should always check the good smooth ice.

80
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:03,140
They shouldn’t try parts of it because they may fall through the freshly frozen parts.

81
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,960
But they should always examine it with that staff first.

82
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:12,495
Always examine it first even if he’s in a hurry.

83
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:19,915
This was also our instructions when young people would travel like this:

84
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:26,480
He must always keep things with him, putting in an ice pick and a shovel.

85
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:32,500
Also, always go with a tarpaulin without saying it’s too heavy.

86
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:44,560
Also, if one is lost and the weather turns on them, it will be better if he doesn’t go any further when he doesn’t know where he is anymore, but stop and stay where he is.

87
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:47,985
Not staying still, but trying to stay warm in the cold.

88
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:55,625
Do not stay still and sit, but try to keep warm without going any further.

89
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:02,250
If he keeps going, he will go far until he eventually runs out of gas.

90
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,395
And those looking for him will not find him right away if he continued traveling like that.
