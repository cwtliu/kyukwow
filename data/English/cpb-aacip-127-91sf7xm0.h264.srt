00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,070
Hello, I’m Hazel Lincoln, and my Yup’ik name is Qang’allugaq.

2
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:55,285
Thank you for joining us on our Delta Review.

3
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:59,715
This eveneing, an elder for Kwethluk, Jimmy Chimigalrea, will join us.

4
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:06,825
We will also be showing the others who Yup’ik danced in Mountain Village for the dance festival this past Sunday.

5
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:10,220
First, let’s listen to what Chimigalrea has to say.

6
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,040
If you understand Yup’ik, listen closely.

7
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:22,405
To all people, we who are listening, all of you people

8
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,630
They are asked to be like this, we need to hear one of them.

9
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:35,645
It says in Philippians 2:12

10
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:44,135
It says this: "As you obey the one whom I love as you are together now

11
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:52,130
"Even though I am not your relative, work on your salvation out of respect and fear.

12
00:01:52,130 --> 00:02:00,660
"For it is God who works in you. He gives you fervor and has you follow his will.

13
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,250
"Work through all of them.

14
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:10,520
"Do not grumblr, and do not say unfavorable things. Do not make yourself need admonishment.

15
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,400
"So that you will be God’s people without drawing attention.

16
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:19,315
"You shall have no ailments among the false and the sinful.

17
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:23,550
"And so that you shall shine like stars among them in the world."

18
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,600
It showed the wisdom concerning life. I started off with that.

19
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,870
It’s time we people hear that, without leaving anyone out.

20
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,030
You know, we shouldn’t [?], and stop lying.

21
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:50,450
Also, we must stop thinking malicious things about those around us, and do not think bad things about people in secret.

22
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,060
That’s all for that.

23
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,830
It’s time that we hear this.

24
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:05,230
Then this, started from a long time ago in those years that have passed

25
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:12,150
Some people tell me that I should talk about this here on KYUK

26
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:19,860
So that my voice would spread out more like this.

27
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,300
Some people up there, far away from the Yukon, have also been telling me for many years.

28
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:34,260
But since I found it daunting to go to KYUK, I wouldn’t go to them before this.

29
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:45,260
Also, I used to look for someone to who could speak about this better than I could.

30
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:47,800
However, some of them would say to me

31
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:58,290
Oh my, they said that there is no one who can say it better than me. They said that I should speak about it instead.

32
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,340
Now, I am finally going to speak about it.

33
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:14,640
You see, when they used to speak about the end of the world, I was born in time to see the ones who spoke about the end of the world.

34
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:23,890
Well, I was born in time to see the ones who spoke about the time of famine far in the future.

35
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:35,410
Then, you see, what that one person said always comes to mind now.

36
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:44,080
Then since it always come to my mind, I’ve become wary of this world, thinking that it would end badly.

37
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:51,700
And I’m not the only one. Some others have become wary of this world.

38
00:04:53,075 --> 00:05:05,250
Back then, you see, I realized when I became observant that some old men and women would walk, supporting themselves on their knees like this

39
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,100
Yet some couldn’t walk anymore

40
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,410
When they had old women and men.

41
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:19,695
They would carry some out of the community house to take sweat baths

42
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:24,705
And when they were done, they brought in the ones who couldn’t walk anymore.

43
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:32,630
Then when they spoke about the end of the world, some of them said this:

44
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:40,100
They said that those who are the oldest there under the earth

45
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,520
Those who lived, the oldest ones, under the one we used to hear about

46
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:54,160
They said, "A person lives for quite a long time. (S)he will not live another [life]."

47
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,830
They also said this:

48
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:06,560
You see, they said, a long time ago... when they used to speak about the end of the world a long time ago

49
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,660
You see, they said, some of these great hunters

50
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:20,255
After this old man was laying in the community house, he said listening to the one by the wall near the door say

51
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:28,445
They said that one of them got up, "Ah, it should happen already while we are [doing well]."

52
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:32,475
They said that it was apparently when the one who would [?take] them was getting close.

53
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:41,930
They said that when people, you know, apparently waited for others to act, you know people sometimes wait for others to act

54
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:50,450
When they ask to be set free when what they’re about to do is approaching.

55
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:55,165
Then at that time, at that time

56
00:06:55,735 --> 00:07:03,335
I also used to see those days. I think those happened over one winter.

57
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:14,790
Day started breaking after dawn like this further upriver, past where the day breaks toward the north.

58
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:17,905
The wonderful day became night.

59
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:26,275
Some of those men say that the day has become false, without any further explanation.

60
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:34,805
Then one day, we were playing excitedly, and it got dark.

61
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:42,625
I went into a house that was not of those who raised me.

62
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:47,455
Then right when I went in, that woman came in after me.

63
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,765
Then when she came in, she said before she sat down there, "There is now day out there."

64
00:07:53,765 --> 00:08:02,020
The the old man of that house said

65
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:08,700
"When this world is on the brink [of ending], it doesn’t leave its people in the dark.

66
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:12,065
"But, you see, it gives them notice first.

67
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:19,560
"Look, it is giving notice to them about the lesson it’s going to teach them.

68
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:26,615
"It sees its people, sees the people on this earth because it’s time for them.

69
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:32,265
"Look, it is showing it to them, and will [correct] them through that."

70
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:37,895
Then he said, "People will wait expectantly.

71
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:47,305
"Watch, as they are eagerly waiting, they will stop waiting eagerly, then there will be no one left who is wating eagerly.

72
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:53,100
"And watch, they will stop hearing anyone say the world is ending."

73
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,680
We now coincide with what he said.

74
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:09,770
He also said that there would be no more snow, that is, when [the world] starts putting it into one place.

75
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,600
Now, what he said always comes to mind.

76
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,110
I am not wary of this world. I don’t know what this world is doing.

77
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,220
Then, they also said this:

78
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,660
"Fish roe," it was the only one they mentioned.

79
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:38,580
They said that fish roe would be in the land year after year. They said it wouldn’t spoil.

80
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:44,835
It will not become dangerous inside a person though it spends year after year in the land.

81
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,370
That was the only one they mentioned.

82
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,270
Then these days, there are now freezers.

83
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:57,185
But there are two things, there are two things [that don’t spoil] in freezers.

84
00:09:57,185 --> 00:10:05,255
But when I think about this salted fish, it may also spend year after year if it is salted well

85
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:09,570
It may take on years, but that will not spoil either.

86
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,600
There are two things [that don’t spoil] in freezers. What it does is irregular.

87
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:24,240
And these days, our [Caucasian] counterparts are [?] in this current day.

88
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:32,295
But as they go, it’s hard to know when I think about it.

89
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:38,550
Look, I’ve started hearing since a long time ago, since quite a while ago

90
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,260
In those lands way over there that I do not see where there are a lot of people

91
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:50,350
It started getting cold where they do not know cold; it started snowing where they do not know snow.

92
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,270
That is negatively affecting crops.

93
00:10:55,275 --> 00:11:02,350
It is also negatively affecting animal young, whatever wildlife there is.

94
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,930
Maybe the people of the lands that I do not see

95
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:14,330
They are trying, trying [things] with their crops.

96
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,150
When I think about it and pretend I’m there

97
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:25,855
They will not turn their back on their lives and consider Alaskan people more important.

98
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:34,590
I was also told this, I was told this that was untranslated from a knowledgeable person:

99
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:44,685
"Those with crops must [survive] with their crops. Those with food [from animals] must survive with their foor [from animals]."

100
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:47,665
Then he also said this:

101
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:54,430
"Watch, when the false day that wilts plants is nigh

102
00:11:54,435 --> 00:12:01,825
"Watch, people will start fighting, acting crazy. They will no longer await anything."

103
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:10,675
You see, we are corresponding to what is like this in these current days.

104
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:13,225
They care nothing for their families anymore.

105
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:23,900
Oh my, it is clear these days that their grandmother is not a teacher.

106
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:31,200
Also, you see, we poor grandfathers of their are also not teachers in random places here.

107
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:39,640
It truly seems that the chidlren of the next generation, it truly seems that we watch them with levity.

108
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,660
We have no [?affection] these days.

109
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:47,065
Then when I ponder

110
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:53,700
When the world is on the verge of doing this, though it is on the verge of going through this winter

111
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,460
It will not tell it’s people that it’s going to do it now.

112
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:01,935
It turns out it was all of that.

113
00:13:01,935 --> 00:13:10,990
It had already shown its people through that, without leaving anything out, that it would do that.

114
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,950
Then, that old man also said this:

115
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:21,585
"Watch, when that time of famine is nigh

116
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:32,590
These two, sheefish, Bering cisco, watch, they rivers will be filled with those two fish."

117
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:41,250
He said that when a person runs out [of food] like this, one of those two will be his source of food.

118
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:49,905
He said that he will eat a lot of one of those two. He said that despite that, he will grow skinny, his flesh falling off.

119
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:55,315
Those to healthy and good fish that are also fatty

120
00:13:55,485 --> 00:14:00,915
"So," he said, "so those two are the fish of famine."

121
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:08,745
I haven’t forgotten this. Since it always comes to mind now, I’ve become wary of this world.

122
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:12,100
Then, people back then also said this:

123
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:20,750
"These three, king salmon, chum salmon, silver salmon, those don’t run out."

124
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:27,680
That’s why they gave this piece of traditional wisdom to the children of our descendants today like this:

125
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:36,700
While those are swimming, if a person is able, he should not be lazy, but take as much as he can from them.

126
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:41,855
They admonished against [?being unprepared for] fall.

127
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:51,610
They said that if it is going to have that kind of winter, all of the things that come after them will be gone.

128
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,510
This always comes to mind now.

129
00:14:56,515 --> 00:15:02,830
Then when that famine comes upon them

130
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:08,610
I was also told about that. It’s been quite a while.

131
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:14,625
It also moved my mind when the one who told me told this to me

132
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:19,635
It also moved his mind as he said this:

133
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:23,710
He said that he dreamt he was drift netting.

134
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:30,550
He let the current carry him, however we drift net, you drift net.

135
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:34,365
Then when it was time, he rolled up his net.

136
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:43,455
As he was rolling up his net, a fish appeared down there, entirely covered in bones yet was moving.

137
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:48,510
Then when it appeared, it said to the one who caught it

138
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,960
"Wait a second. I have two things to say."

139
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,900
Then it said to the one who had caught it

140
00:15:56,905 --> 00:16:04,715
"After a few years, the time of famine is going to come

141
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:08,185
"And the spirit of theft is going to be active."

142
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:17,060
Look, though the people I was born to see had talked for a long time

143
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,300
You see, that was the first time I heard about the spirit of theft.

144
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:26,515
Then after that person spoke to me

00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:33,045
It seems that every year, people get worse. They seem to get worse.

146
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:38,400
They do not share with their families. They steal from them, even take their food away.

147
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,860
When I ponder upon these people now

148
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:48,075
If these they desire what was taken away from their stomachs, how far will they go?

149
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,290
They will also take from their families.

150
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,760
Or, these people are not like long ago anymore.

151
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,210
Some have no more inhibitions, and some have gotten dangerous.

152
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,260
And one of them will be killed because he has a little food.

153
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,170
It’s getting to long. This is all I will say about it.

154
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,670
Thank you Chimigalrea.

155
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:14,835
Now, the dancers of Emmonak recorded a video when Mountain Village held a challenge feast.

156
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:16,464
Thank you. I am Qang’allugaq.

157
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:20,614
