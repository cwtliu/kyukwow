1
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:23,690
Now, I am thankful to these people who came from somewhere far away to have me speak about what I wouldn’t have spoken about

2
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:25,270
When I’ve wanted to speak about.

3
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:31,810
And when I sometimes come across KYUK over there, I want to speak.

4
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:38,585
I want to say this, in case some one of the boys may come to a realization.

5
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:49,630
So, hear what I have to say, all of you who are listening, includin in the areas around them, and even here in Hooper Bay.

6
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:56,540
Now, I hope that some people, eve just one, will say that in his mind.

7
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:02,370
Especially with this thing that ends lives that you tend to abuse

8
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:11,100
It it were a traditional instruction, if alcohol were an instruction, no one would use it no matter who they were.

9
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,870
One tends to abuse it because it’s not an instruction, but admonished against.

10
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:20,720
However, they don’t practice these traditional instructions.

11
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:30,110
However, they break themselves over what are not part of traditional instructions.

12
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,520
But I am thankful for speaking though it wasn’t much.

13
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,790
Thank you very much, goodbye, but have a good day.

14
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:10,050
I used these back when the people of Hooper Bay were afflicted with big sores, including little children.

15
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:12,425
I used this

16
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:19,115
Because I heard there was no remedy when it’s all over.

17
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,390
The sores also grew large, and on my buttocks down there, they started pulsing along with my heartbeat.

18
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:33,180
Then I started thinking, remember what the people up north said.

19
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,710
The urine, I went to get my great-grandparent’s urine.

20
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:45,330
I went to get it with a container, and washed myself with that.

21
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:47,675
Whoo, very strong.

22
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,430
The sores on my body burned.

23
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:56,505
It was sore here, and I washed the slimy discharge off of my buttocks.

24
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:58,875
I was having slimy discharge.

25
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:03,645
It’s like fish slime, from the sores.

26
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:13,135
Then when I was done, I dumped that out, and replaced it with another that I boiled, rinsing these sores.

27
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:15,845
I rinsed with their broth.

28
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:23,695
When I finished rinsing, my body was then in great suffering, like all of it was pulsing

29
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:29,065
Too many sores in my body, mostly in my sit[ting area].

30
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:35,755
They grew large, pulsing from my heart, along with [my heartbeat].

31
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,890
And next day, when I finally got better.

32
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,190
I kept breathing it, it’s like I smell it for long time.

33
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:49,575
It’s like it coulsn’t get out of my mouth, my breath.

34
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:59,420
Then the next day, I woke up and they had become clean, had dried up.

35
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:08,180
Then when they dried up, following that time, they improved until eventually they got better.

36
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,830
And after that, I never went through that again.

37
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:46,840
These days, in the winter

38
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,640
These pieces of rain gear, rain pants

39
00:04:53,915 --> 00:05:02,655
Those are things that should not be missing when one travels in the winter like this.

40
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:14,980
In order for this body to stay well

41
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:28,937
Through that, when we traveled on the land here in the wilderness, these pieces of rain gear, yes, should not be missing

42
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:34,658
So that this body will stay well [and safe].

43
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:46,279
Then, should one also be withouta rain gear when they come to misfortune in the wilderness

44
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:55,854
If the weather turns on them, they would instruct us

45
00:05:56,364 --> 00:06:07,963
They said that if we get lost, we shouldn’t keep going but stop

46
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:11,938
Or if a blizzard starts on us.

47
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:19,611
They said that if we are standing as we are now

48
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:32,682
If we have nothing as we travel, and don’t have a tarpaulin

49
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:35,880
They used to instruct us like this:

50
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:46,678
They said that if we get into misfortune and a blizzard sets on us, we should dig into the snow like this.

51
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:57,947
They told us to go in, but to have something in hand.

52
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:04,928
They said that this walking staff will also save this body.

53
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:14,881
Or if he has not staff in the winter, he should hold a little tree as he travels.

54
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:24,559
Then if a blizzard sets and he’s lost, he should dive and have the snow build.

55
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:33,717
But those things, you know how we call those deep hollows [?kanarvikneret]?

56
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:39,892
If there’s a blizzard, the [the snowbank] up there is tall, and this is deeply hollowed

57
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:46,144
They said we shouldn’t let the snow cover us there.

58
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:54,840
Instead, they said to dig a snowbank that isn’t tall.

59
00:07:54,857 --> 00:08:07,428
When we go in as soon as we fit in there, we should cover the entrace here with snow.

60
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:11,619
But they said not to have it encase us.

61
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:20,475
Do this to the know, and set this [staff] upright up there, piercing the ceiling.

62
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:30,350
If the snow covers us, we should do this with [the hole] up there.

63
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:37,885
They said that if it’s airtight under the snow, the person will suffocate.

64
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:20,706
These traditional instructions when I became aware when we were boys, one should not ignore the like this.

65
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:32,850
Sometimes their stomachs, when they didn’t have these stores, when they only had what they gathered from here

66
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:40,030
Sometimes, they would discouraged from their stomachs.

67
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:50,226
We would also be discouraged from having nothing, no clothes, and did not ignore [traditional wisdom].

68
00:09:50,530 --> 00:10:01,645
Those people I was born in time to see back then only gathered [?through hard work] from here, not from stores.

69
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:07,006
Those were their food sources.

70
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:12,851
I also know that their bodies were strong.

71
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:22,594
Though these people looked old, they would be strong like this.

72
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:29,482
Also, those people I saw in my earliest memories were good.

73
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:34,536
They were compassionate, and [followed] traditional wisdom.

74
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:38,042
They were also good like that.

75
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:44,324
They also followed their traditional wisdom.

76
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:56,914
The people who were my instructs always told me not to act mindlessly like this.

77
00:10:56,927 --> 00:11:04,484
I also joind those who were being mischievous.

78
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:15,689
They said that those who are being mischievous together, acting mischievous, do not let us gain anything.

79
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:26,477
But they said that one who is always sensible, who constantly does what they should do

80
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:32,279
Would go [through life] correctly, and well.

81
00:11:56,836 --> 00:12:03,979
This is what they call our medicine, rosewort.

82
00:12:05,764 --> 00:12:08,764
It’s Yup’ik name is caqlaq.

83
00:12:08,783 --> 00:12:11,626
It’s our medicine for sore throats.

84
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:14,575
I’m going to cut it now.

85
00:12:15,688 --> 00:12:17,516
Oh my.

86
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:23,248
I’m going to cut part of it and chew it.

87
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:28,842
This was their medicing long ago when they didn’t have [Western] medicine.

88
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:47,943
With these, when I had a bad sore throat recently, doctors did things to me, gave me all kinds of shots in the clinic.

89
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:54,317
They gave me many shots. I took this and ate some.

90
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:59,652
Then I ate and woke up the next day to find my sore throat was gone.

91
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:03,691
But this was their medicine long ago.

92
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:07,449
There’s some over there, and inland.

93
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,174
When they grow, there are a lot of them.

94
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:18,449
And altogether now, I got one whole full jar.

95
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:23,387
And though my daughter rejects and fears these

96
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:36,514
"You’re so foolish. Wouldn’t your grandma tell you to eat these when you have a sore throat? And she’d chew them and feed them to you when you had sores."

97
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,191
We used to do that long ago.

98
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:10,375
She said that if I look for vole caches with mare’s-tail tubers

99
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:17,945
If I find a vole cache with sticklebacks, needlefish

100
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:23,593
She said I should eat one, but just one.

101
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:29,406
Then as I was looking for vole caches, I found one with so many moving.

102
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:36,907
Then I thought, "Oh my, didn’t my Aana tell me that if I found a cache with sticklacks that I should eat one?"

103
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:40,083
I ate one.

104
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:45,894
When I would go to the wilderness, that’s how she would instruct me.

105
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:55,932
Then one day, my companion found a vole cache, since Ignatius Black and I were friends when we were small.

106
00:14:55,947 --> 00:15:00,075
When he found a cache, he called to me, "Oh my, what are these?"

107
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,652
Oh my, I went to him and found those bugs.

108
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:14,461
Those things that go into ears, [?meriit].

109
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:19,445
Oh my, they were moving. How could we eat them?

110
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:26,457
After I [?], I heard my companion, "They’re not sticklebacks. I won’t eat those."

111
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:28,985
And we traveled on.

112
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:37,803
When we arrived home, my Aana [Mother], my great-grandma ended up asking me what I did with those.

113
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:42,048
"So did you eat?" "I ate." And he was thankful for me.

114
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:44,075
Oh my, what were they?

115
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:50,449
Maybe they were my Aana’s work. I think she bewitched me.

116
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:27,430
My baby son, my last baby, was bitten, bitten by his older brother.

117
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:32,413
He bit him here, bit him here twice.

118
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:47,438
I found him and found that he took this and stuffed the two bite punctures with these.

119
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:50,656
He stuffed and bound them.

120
00:16:50,666 --> 00:17:01,138
He showed them the next morning, and oh my, they were healed. What was swollen and red was gone.

121
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:07,394
At that time, the health aides were also amazed at that, the [?].

122
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,601
He was supposed to get shots.

123
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,720
Since he didn’t want to travel there, as he was supposed to go in the evening the next day

124
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:19,936
He stuffed them with these without our knowledge.

125
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:26,212
They healed. And he never said there was any problem with this part.

126
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:30,062
He stuffed them with these.

127
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:08,185
And so, I lived by trying to obey my parents when I was small.

128
00:18:08,484 --> 00:18:14,213
And my father’s traditional wisdom back then never leaves my mind.

129
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:24,874
He told me that if I do not live well and go to other villages that are not my own

130
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:33,288
He said that when they hear my name, they will know me by my misbehavior.

131
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:42,938
He told me so that I’d be ashamed [of being like that. And now, I always remember his instruction.

132
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:53,143
My mother also told me to always be compassionate to those around me.

133
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:58,875
You young people must obey your parents.

134
00:18:58,895 --> 00:19:03,623
And never forget the traditional wisdom you were told when you were small.

135
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:12,109
It’s especially important for you to respect your parent in the home.

136
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:17,554
Do not speak harshly or do things harshly

137
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:22,061
Try not to [negatively] affect your parents’ mental state.

138
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:31,489
Your parents, those who are parents are heartbroken without your knowledge when you misbehave.

139
00:19:56,466 --> 00:20:02,224
Then, my parents used to tell me this:

140
00:20:03,216 --> 00:20:14,273
If I deal with something, even smoke or something that I get tired of smelling

141
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:20,786
Starting from when we were smell, they’d apply seal oil inside our noses

142
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:29,076
Because we might get headaches, and we might be negatively affected by that odor.

143
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:36,822
The same way with gas, we get tired of smelling gas even though they’re not smoke.

144
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:46,874
We must apply [seal oil] inside our noses, and also apply it to children’s noses.

145
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:53,348
Also, if you go to the wilderness and get sick

146
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:59,843
You have no medicine if you’re in the wilderness and get into misfortune.

147
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:09,091
If you have seal oil when you have a bad cold, if your throat inside is bad and has prickling pain

148
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:14,509
You must [?take] seal oil. My mother used to say that to us.

149
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:20,634
Also, they would have us drink [seal oil] if we had a persistent cough

150
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:28,011
When we had no aspirin, they would have us do that when we were small since we didn’t have clinics.

151
00:21:54,488 --> 00:22:02,688
It’s very bad for you to abuse alcohol.

152
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:11,385
Instead, alcohol only leads to trouble.

153
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:20,698
Also, when a person abuses alcohol too much, they come upon things they’re not supposed to and bring misfortune upon themselves.

154
00:22:20,713 --> 00:22:24,699
Also, this other one, smoking...

155
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:27,338
Close it.

156
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:38,782
The other one, smoking only goes to the mind, and along with this body.

157
00:22:38,797 --> 00:22:43,168
I don’t experience what it’s like.

158
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:53,259
But I hear about what that smoking is like, that it destroys the mind.

159
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:58,952
Also, that one who smokes too much starts sleeping all the time.

160
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,189
That’s what I hear [happens] when they smoke.

161
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:10,339
I think that truly happens.

162
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:14,260
One who smokes too much sleeps all the time.

163
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:19,076
They also [become] forgetful, you know?

164
00:23:19,387 --> 00:23:27,087
They forgot what to do. And when they put things down, they immediately forget them.

165
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:58,114
Once, we almost suffocated inland.

166
00:23:59,197 --> 00:24:06,326
There were three of us, my younger sibling, that one who moved to Kwethluk, and me.

167
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:22,090
When we set up a tent in a deep hollow, a blizzard started at night.

168
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:27,121
When we [set up] when it was windy, the weather turned.

169
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:34,760
I opened my eyes and felt suffocated. I shot right up and hit this.

170
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:40,477
Apparently, the snow was weighing down on it.

171
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:51,801
We went out after much effeort, and our things were wet, yet the weather outside was very cold.

172
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:59,167
Apparently, [being] under the snow if very hot and suffocating.

173
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:08,501
As the snow was melting like this, our things got wet, our bedding.

174
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:26,310
That’s why they would admonish us like this: if the weather turns on us, not to seek shelter in deep hollows, not to have snow fall and cover us.

175
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:34,240
Instead, [seek shelter] in short banks, or if there’s snow, where it will be thin.

176
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:41,413
Also, pierce the ceiling up there, and move [the staff] back and forth.

177
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:51,832
Then if we know that we will not arrive back home

178
00:25:51,843 --> 00:26:01,057
They said we should stick something in the ground toward our destination and go in.

179
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:09,760
They said that if dawn comes with good [weather]

180
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:18,230
We will know where we are, and will go toward our destination.

181
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:34,109
You see, because they don’t instruct on how to discern [one’s whereabouts]

182
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:41,341
And because we don’t instruct it, we don’t know it anymore.

183
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:46,882
We have no idea what to do these days.

184
00:27:11,658 --> 00:27:25,644
I also remember that those who raised us back then had us know our relatives.

185
00:27:25,658 --> 00:27:40,887
Though they lived in other villages, you know, they said they were our male cross-cousins, maternal uncles, maternal aunts, female cross-cousins.

186
00:27:40,903 --> 00:27:44,403
They would be pointed out.

187
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:56,402
These days, we don’t know how we’re related anymore.

188
00:27:56,901 --> 00:28:09,486
When we were boys like this back then, those who raised us would point out [how we were related].

189
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:23,615
And when these families arrived from other villages, they would point out [how we’re related] when they arrived.

190
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:31,182
They said that we and that one are related.

191
00:28:31,189 --> 00:28:38,303
We’re cross-cousins, or neices/nephews and maternal uncles. Like that.

192
00:28:38,322 --> 00:28:46,680
Through that, we would know them when we were demonstrated [how we were related].

193
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:56,183
These days, however, we don’t know how we’re related anymore.

194
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:08,784
And by now knowing how we’re related, how we’re not shown [how we’re related]

195
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:14,518
People are starting to fight these days.

196
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:23,693
And yet, though they’re related, they don’t know each other.

197
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:27,467
They’ve started opposing each other these days.

198
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:32,794
People back then were peaceful.

199
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:39,709
There was no one fighting.

200
00:29:59,452 --> 00:30:03,181
We’ve gotten better, not suffering anymore.

201
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:16,835
The West provides us with akauterments through our clothes, transportation, different things, food, and these houses.

202
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:26,569
We’re not suffering anymore. They aren’t cold at night anymore. We’ve started being in hot [home] environments.

203
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:31,174
It’s gotten better.

204
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:38,080
But they’ve become bad, we’ve become bad these days

205
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:42,625
They’ve started fighting, started killing each other.

206
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:52,669
They’re exactly what the traditioanl wisdom pointed out [would happen].

207
00:30:54,449 --> 00:31:07,392
Now, you boys and girls who are listening, remember what you just heard.

208
00:31:07,402 --> 00:31:13,016
Those who raised us back then were not like this.

209
00:31:13,257 --> 00:31:24,857
There not a lot of possessions in the house because their houses were not like this.

210
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:38,649
And when they slept at night in the cold, the little bukets filled with water would be frozen, would freeze.

211
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:47,952
And though they were on top of stoves, though those kettles had  been warm, some would be frozen.

212
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:14,213
Back in the 1930s, there used to be a lot of snow when I was a boy.

213
00:32:14,353 --> 00:32:25,353
Sometimes, when there’s persistent southern winds and heavy snow, they say the marsh freezes, cirmiggluni.

214
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:33,445
Though there’s snow now, the tundra here is not frozen.

215
00:32:34,905 --> 00:32:44,891
Though there’s a lot of snow, sometimes there’s not a great flood of water, though there’s a lot of water, but the melted ice ebbs out late.

216
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:51,733
They said it would probably freeze repeatedly and deplete its water.

217
00:32:52,256 --> 00:32:58,742
But when it’s ice and can’t do that, there’s a great flood of water.

218
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:04,178
Also, when rivers have a lot of snow, the ice isn’t thick.

219
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:13,942
Since it’s not as thick as it usually is, I don’t think that it’ll flood though there’s a lot of water for that reason.

220
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:21,236
Back when it would get very cold, it’s not like now as you know.

221
00:33:21,255 --> 00:33:23,498
Would you hear of anyone freezing to death?

222
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:29,203
We didn’t hear of anyone freezing because we had warm fur clothes.

223
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:34,375
Though it also gets cold now, it doesn’t get as cold as it used to.

224
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:43,508
Since we don’t have good [warm] clothes anymore,  when it gest a little cold, we like to say it’s cold.

225
00:34:09,986 --> 00:34:18,070
These things when I was a boy like this, when we were boys

226
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:33,421
These things on land were our food sources, animals to catch, marine animals, and these birds.

227
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:40,769
These days, they are depleting.

228
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:48,685
These marine animals are getting scarce now.

229
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:55,093
These birds are also getting scarce.

230
00:34:55,112 --> 00:35:08,241
Back when we were boys, at least when I was a boy, there used to be very many birds.

231
00:35:08,962 --> 00:35:16,176
The wilderness was quiet. It wasn’t like this [now].

232
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:24,730
We wouldn’t hear anything rumbling at dawn, things rumbling outside.

233
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:33,738
When they went to spring camp at spring inland in the Akula region, it was wonderful.

234
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:38,622
Different kinds of birds called.

235
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:53,544
And these hunters in the evening, in the early evening, the muskrat hunters would spend the evening [doing that] in the spring camps inland.

236
00:35:53,866 --> 00:36:01,566
They would start popping. The air would be filled with gunshots everywhere like this.

237
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:11,724
And these birds inland, since they would set up spring camps on lake shores

238
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:17,493
It was fun with the birds swimming and calling.

239
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:26,354
It would be wonderful in the spring.

240
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:59,848
When they traveled to their settlements, they would go upriver and [?] what they would use for their houses

241
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:05,061
Because those winter camp settlements would be on the riverbank.

242
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,780
Then when they arrived

243
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:18,308
Those things that they brought with them, if they arrived without having brought wood upriver

244
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:23,138
Those related men who work together would gather.

245
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:27,854
They would travel with a Yup’ik boat.

246
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:35,052
They would load it with [?] and even wood for houses and bring it upriver.

247
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:44,352
Then when they arrived like this, those relatevies who work together would help each other to build a house.

248
00:37:44,682 --> 00:37:53,482
Those relatives who work together would work on that house they would stay in for the winter.

249
00:37:54,631 --> 00:38:00,146
Then when the house is done and it’s time to go in, when they go in

250
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:06,067
There wouldn’t be a sing person, but familes with several members.

251
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:14,911
If there are four familes in one house, these will be here, and on the other side here, and here.

252
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:19,125
There are four of what they call families in English.

253
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:27,723
There would be a lot of people in that one house, those relatives.

254
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:35,390
Also, when they were there in that house, these food sources

255
00:38:37,006 --> 00:38:47,706
That one family alone wouldn’t have them, but everyone in that house would eat from what food they had.

256
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:59,683
Some would have [their own] houses, where those who provide for their [nuclear] families would live in one house.

257
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:03,927
But there would always be a lot of people in them.

258
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:12,848
These several [nuclear] families would live in the house, those relatives.

259
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:15,995
That’s what they were like.

260
00:39:16,014 --> 00:39:27,642
Also, their food stores that they got from the wilderness, blackfish, saffron cod, or various fish that they catch in winter, fall to eat frozen

261
00:39:27,654 --> 00:39:42,168
Inside the house, and not only for the ones who caught them, but that food would be for everyone in that house, including their men over in the community house.

262
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:48,097
That’s what those we watched back then were like.

263
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:23,983
We small boy also had this learning experience:

264
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:30,548
We would hunt these little birds.

265
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,641
There were also a lot of them.

266
00:40:33,643 --> 00:40:41,114
We would hunt those little birds by shooting arrows at them.

267
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:48,741
And, you know, they wouldn’t throw away what we caught.

268
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:59,015
These little girls would also pluck their feathers and cook them.

269
00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:08,083
However, our mother would also cook what we caught, not throw them away.

270
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:17,985
They respected them like this, those poeple back then revered the food that we caught from the land.

271
00:41:20,098 --> 00:41:24,241
These days, however, what are they doing?

272
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:35,136
And our children no longer hunt these little birds that we used to shoot arrows at.

273
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:45,394
They things that we used to hunt in the spring are no longer seen here on the land.

274
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:53,433
Then when the birds in the trees hatched in the summer

275
00:41:53,443 --> 00:41:59,243
There would be very many going into smoke houses.

276
00:41:59,258 --> 00:42:04,043
We would also shoot them with arrows.

277
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:13,138
We would skin the little things, open them up from their chests and remove their flesh

278
00:42:13,148 --> 00:42:18,633
And prop the here on their wings

279
00:42:18,644 --> 00:42:23,458
Then thread them through and hang them on trees.

280
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:31,482
They called that nakaculiluki, "making them into bladders." That’s what they did.

281
00:42:32,022 --> 00:42:37,608
There were many little birds, and they wouldn’t deplete.

282
00:43:03,636 --> 00:43:15,836
Our caretakers here, starting from the spring until the birds went downriver like this

283
00:43:16,444 --> 00:43:22,344
They would eat them as a food source, including their eggs.

284
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:28,012
We wouldn’t hear anything about them depleting or population drops.

285
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:36,706
But they would do this: every year, something would be low in numbers

286
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,557
And sometimes there would be a lot, with fluctuating populations.

287
00:43:42,563 --> 00:43:46,349
But they wouldn’t deplete, wouldn’t go exctinct.

288
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:53,172
There were always a lot of birds and marine animals.

289
00:43:53,195 --> 00:44:03,138
Then they would eat birds in the spring like this until there were fish.

290
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:07,771
They only stopped when they went downriver, wouldn’t go [hunt them] again.

291
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:17,881
There would be no one left in the Akula region, only down on the Kuskokwim.

292
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:24,763
They also turned to fish. There were also a lot of fish.

293
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:42,066
Through their reverence, since they’re God’s gifts and they were revered, he always kept them in large numbers.

294
00:44:42,484 --> 00:44:54,355
When I think about these these days, those people kept a close eye on and were careful with whatever food they had.

295
00:44:54,414 --> 00:44:59,714
There used to be a lot of fish across there when we were boys like this.

296
00:45:00,584 --> 00:45:04,599
And they would ram into the bank here.

297
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:13,199
And when we swam, sometimes the fish would ram into us somewhere here.

298
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:24,905
Then since we don’t revere them these days, things are depleting.

299
00:45:50,461 --> 00:46:01,431
Then when they hunted beluga, they would admonish us against ever wading, when they hunted beluga.

300
00:46:01,452 --> 00:46:09,609
When we were across there on this side, they would admonish us against ever wading.

301
00:46:09,627 --> 00:46:16,970
Saying that those people were hunting beluga, they admonished us like that.

302
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:25,816
Then there are no more these days because we don’t hunt them anymore.

303
00:46:25,842 --> 00:46:37,199
And there are no more of these little birds because we don’t hunt them with arrows anymore.

304
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:48,924
However, our counterparts who regulate them have put restrictions to try to raise their numbers

305
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:54,140
Having us stop hunting birds.

306
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:01,323
Those who raised us back then didn’t stop [hunting] these birds.

307
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:09,558
After it was their food source inland in the spring, then when they went downriver

308
00:47:10,983 --> 00:47:19,125
After they fished, when they molted and couldn’t fly, along with their chicks

309
00:47:19,275 --> 00:47:30,747
When their offspring grew to the same size, they hunted those too. They would return with full kayaks.

310
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:37,751
And they wouldn’t be affected, wouldn’t decrease.

311
00:47:38,298 --> 00:47:44,512
These days, however, thigns are disappearing, including little birds.

312
00:47:44,525 --> 00:47:49,954
Or is it because we don’t hunt them anymore?

313
00:48:17,438 --> 00:48:27,194
As I sat there, I found my dog was already rocking back and forth in the door, oh my, as if sensing something.

314
00:48:27,213 --> 00:48:33,684
I thought, "As expected, it’s going to get me now."

315
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:43,962
Oh my, I stayed still. As I stayed still, you see, something that looked like white steam slowly came in.

316
00:48:43,983 --> 00:48:48,240
Then at some point, it retracted and went out.

317
00:48:48,255 --> 00:48:53,155
A thought came to mind, "It’ll come closer next time."

318
00:48:53,160 --> 00:49:02,860
And my dog started pacing here. It was clear it was afraid like me. It was afraid.

319
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:12,039
Then next time, it got worse, even waving its nose around, and almost barking.

320
00:49:12,054 --> 00:49:17,081
Eventually, you see, this steam starting coming in.

321
00:49:17,096 --> 00:49:27,154
When it finally retracted after reaching the middle, my dog went behind me.

322
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:34,438
Behind me, it put its snout on my spine and stayed.

323
00:49:34,446 --> 00:49:41,360
When that steam went toward the door, when it went out

324
00:49:41,372 --> 00:49:47,386
My dog behind me started pushing my back with its snout.

325
00:49:47,403 --> 00:49:53,260
A thought came to mind, "This [dog] probably wants me to go out."

326
00:49:53,274 --> 00:50:03,402
Oh my, after I tried to stay, I [rolled up] my bedding, and put on my parka

327
00:50:03,421 --> 00:50:11,121
I rolled up and bound my bedding, put on my hat, and went out.

328
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:20,448
There was a piece of cloth hanging here on the outer entrance.

329
00:50:20,468 --> 00:50:24,482
But the exit to outside was a real door.

330
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:35,132
When I was going to go out, when I put on my hand, I blew on those lamps in an arc. I turned them off.

331
00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:46,427
Oh my, when I went out measuring the door, when I reached that cloth, I bumped into that [?qakugcaq] that I was afraid of.

332
00:50:47,213 --> 00:50:52,885
Oh my, before I [hit] it, I went outside.

333
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:58,686
When I went out, I went this way, and I think I went the wrong way

334
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:05,717
Because I think they said to go around it following the way the sun goes.

335
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:11,421
And I didn’t look around, only for what I would trip over below me.

336
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:15,735
When I went around it, I didn’t look around me.

337
00:51:15,754 --> 00:51:20,712
I spread out my dogs because I only had three dogs.

338
00:51:20,717 --> 00:51:28,317
When I spread them out, my lead dog came to the lead dog’s spot.

339
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:38,919
When I put the harness on it, it put them on by itself without being told to, and crouched.

340
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:47,886
Then after I harnessed it, it didn’t look around except what it was watching [in front of it].

341
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:52,850
Oh my, when I finished them, I went hait.

342
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:57,034
It seemed like a snowgo when I went.

343
00:51:57,034 --> 00:52:04,048
Oh my, I was so scared that [?] would take me from behind.

344
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:09,104
You see, I was amazed by my dog.

345
00:52:09,116 --> 00:52:16,673
It helped me a lot at that time. It pushed me, clearly wanting me to go out.

346
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:54,759
There are many instructions, instructions for us young people, the traditional wisdom of our grandfathers for those of us who have grandfathers.

347
00:52:54,774 --> 00:53:00,403
Also, when we reached the areas right outside of villages

348
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:08,570
He would tell me this in the fall: if I reach the area right outside of a village and see an elevated hill

349
00:53:08,573 --> 00:53:15,873
I should go to it, climb it, and look around me, look around the village

350
00:53:15,898 --> 00:53:19,512
Making mental maps of these villages.

351
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:31,633
I should pay very close attention to this elevated hill, these elevated hills, and the lakes around these elevated hills.

352
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:38,118
He said those will save me when the weather turns bad if I’m not forgetful

353
00:53:38,136 --> 00:53:42,893
But I didn’t practice those.

354
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:51,282
I used to forget them all the time back then, but I would sometimes know them.

355
00:53:51,299 --> 00:54:00,542
Then he would tell me, "An overconfident person only comes to misfortune"

356
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,771
As they say, an overconfident person.

357
00:54:05,082 --> 00:54:15,368
They said, however, that a timid person doesn’t come to misfortune too much.

358
00:54:15,548 --> 00:54:22,405
Indeed, I experienced that.

359
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:28,667
Because I’m easily scared, I’ve reached this age before coming to misfortune.

360
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:42,902
But only one time in the winter like this recently, when Alba downriver and I went home after coming here

361
00:54:42,926 --> 00:54:50,553
At Qavartarvik downriver, he wanted to camp with me near Kwigillingok.

362
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:56,059
I told him that I’d go down, that the village was close.

363
00:54:56,290 --> 00:55:07,361
When I got lost as we reached the lands, my companion and I stopped, and I said to him

364
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:13,371
"Let’s not continue, but stop, because there’s a blizzard out there."

365
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:19,475
It turned out that we stopped a short ways inland from the village.

366
00:55:19,499 --> 00:55:28,214
When I looked out in the mornign as it was getting bright, I found that the school was in front of us.

367
00:55:30,598 --> 00:55:41,326
I am thankful for what the one before me just said. I can’t add too much to them.

368
00:56:02,914 --> 00:56:08,114
But there’s also an instruction that these didn’t speak about.

369
00:56:08,374 --> 00:56:17,560
There’s another instruction: you can try to save yourself, and you boys can save yourselves.

370
00:56:17,844 --> 00:56:23,744
No matter where you are in the wilderness, even if it’s during the cold season

371
00:56:23,765 --> 00:56:32,665
You must keep yourself warm by your urine, your own urine.

372
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,065
I’ve also done that.

373
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:44,068
All day, since I hadn’t eaten for the whole day, and since my body was wet

374
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:51,383
As I went, I would urinate into a cup since I had a cup, and would drink it right away.

375
00:56:51,386 --> 00:56:57,014
I kept warm and eventually reached my village, since I knew where my home was.

376
00:56:57,019 --> 00:57:04,891
During the time when the days were long but cold, I made it alive.

377
00:57:04,903 --> 00:57:15,775
Then another instruction if you reach someone who’s come to misfortune in the wilderness, without food and cold

378
00:57:17,068 --> 00:57:28,926
This is also the first thing: you can help that cold person with his urine or your urine to warm him up.

379
00:57:28,937 --> 00:57:33,052
And most importantly, don’t put him in heat.

380
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:43,303
If you put him in heat, you know, and you women know, and we men see it

381
00:57:43,538 --> 00:57:49,652
When he’s by a heat source, the cold goes inward.

382
00:57:49,665 --> 00:57:59,979
Though his outside looks warm, the cold inside goes in. It gets stronger inward.

383
00:57:59,995 --> 00:58:02,067
There are those cases.

384
00:58:02,204 --> 00:58:15,462
These things just now, I was hoping some would talk about them so that we could help someone

385
00:58:15,483 --> 00:58:23,655
Should happen across someone that the cold is killing, but [still] alive.

386
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:32,174
That’s the first thing before giving him food, the first way we can help.

387
00:58:32,193 --> 00:58:43,479
Our urine that they point out, what we have always done, and we can help ourselves if we are [freezing] like that.

388
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,086
Thank you.
