1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,850
Let’s speak.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,410
Well, a long time ago, when I became observant

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,980
When we were growing up, we realized that we would hear about what my spouse talked about when we were growing up.

4
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:25,315
But for us young people, those first Caucasians were scary.

5
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:29,645
We would see several Caucasians.

6
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:37,425
We didn’t always see them. Only once in a blue moon, we would see Caucasians who arrived.

7
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:47,430
There you have it. Then one day, we were here in Anuuraaq when they built a school here.

8
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:52,065
They built a school in the middle of us, then they started going to school.

9
00:00:52,340 --> 00:01:01,430
Then we tried to go to school, oh my, our parents were very reluctant to let us go.

10
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,190
They told us not to go to school under any circumstances.

11
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:14,480
They said that those were starting some kind of unacceptable behavior. They said those schools [?made them soft].

12
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,690
They were very scary when we did it then.

13
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:26,650
Though they admonished us, and after I had gone to school, after I had checked them once...

14
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,040
Wait, that fell.

15
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,520
Are you a couple?

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,860
Was it because we were too loud?

17
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:41,065
No.

18
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:49,860
Then after we had gone to school, we went home since they told us to stay.

19
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:57,315
These people kept saying that these schools are faulty.

20
00:01:57,665 --> 00:02:01,175
Over there, they have a bad mischievous result.

21
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:11,725
They said that they would become foolish far in the future, not thinking about what they should be doing when they start bringing things that cause mischief.

22
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:19,495
We didn’t go to school, but our poor young people and our children are starting to go to school.

23
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:23,515
They’re finding out about things and they write about us.

24
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,480
The Caucasians have done that, and they didn’t seem to physically abuse any Caucasians.

25
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:36,605
The work of those shamans were also like that.

26
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,820
People have started having fun about those people they have malicious intent.

27
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:56,115
And this, among their many pieces of traditional wisdom, among those who wanted to speak to us, they say that jealousy is part of traditional wisdom.

28
00:02:57,015 --> 00:03:06,425
They say that a jealous shaman would be jealous of a person who is living a good life

29
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:15,715
They place curses on them to make them bad hunters, or they destroy the riches of one who had been going to live well.

30
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:18,635
Those have great malicious intent.

31
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:25,790
Then, these pieces of traditional wisdom

32
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:37,260
They said that though they despise us among our peers, and they say that we poor young people, girls here, are lazy

33
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:45,320
And because I wouldn’t go out at night, and I would stop going out at night when it got dark

34
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:54,375
They would intimidate me, saying that if I am lazy that I will be a beggar liek this

35
00:03:55,305 --> 00:04:05,095
And they said that it would bring me to misfortune after I was lazy, [?] my family because of my desire to [have things].

36
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:14,965
But those who taught us well would tell us that.

37
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:27,705
And they told us not to misbehave among our peers, not to [?], not to be inattentive, not to act foolish among our peers.

38
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,140
When they got up, they would always tell us, "When you young people have children too

39
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:49,055
"Even though your child seems like a child, or if you admonish them when you put on their skin boots, ’Now, if your peers do anything to you, run away [?].’"

40
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,030
They say that they pay attention.

41
00:04:51,030 --> 00:05:00,500
They say that what these elders of ours heard when they were growing up are theirs.

42
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:12,830
When I remember that now, what I didn’t want, that they would become mischievous in the future

43
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:19,935
And since I don’t speak English and don’t hear them speaking English, I remember them.

44
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:32,125
And when we had children and got married, they told us to love our spouses.

45
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:36,940
We should pay attention to our husbands, and never be unfaithful.

46
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:44,870
And if we women go to [other men] without our husbands’ knowledge

47
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:50,200
They said that eventually, we would become pregnant with a child that is not our husbands’.

48
00:05:50,200 --> 00:06:01,380
Back when we were growing up, we realized that when they spoke to us, they would tell us of unacceptable things [?] them.

49
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:07,500
And when they did that watching us, we who were listening would think this:

50
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:18,080
"Oh my, that person apparently knows us. (S)he saw us." It seemed that they knew us very well, like they had truly seen us.

51
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:31,910
It turned out that those who really wanted to speak to us emptied their hearts of what they had experiences, telling us so that a person would do well.

52
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:39,900
And our poor children, when we have children, they said never to bring them [to others’ houses]

53
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,850
And do not hold their hands to have them visit other houses.

54
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,270
They said they’d become mischievous.

55
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:51,085
They said that their unacceptable behavior would exacerbate our poverty.

56
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:59,520
A mother who looks after the house, and the father who travels for what we need

57
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,870
They said that we women should be thankful for whatever he catches when he arrives.

58
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:17,130
Or if he earns a little money, we women should not be angry wanting beautiful dresses, or something like beautiful shoes

59
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:22,795
Because, they said, that we stand here with good clothes that they’ve gotten us.

60
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:34,300
They say that those destroy our spouses, what they have earned, what our poor husbands have earned.

61
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,220
They said that we should work dextrously with them as our spouse worked dextrously distributing seal.

62
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:43,980
They said not to treat those lightly.

63
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,380
We should not take his heard earned money and go.

64
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:54,545
And as we go, if we come across things that bring mischief, or we drink, or other things

65
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:05,220
They admonished us against all of those dangerous things, and that we shouldn’t do that in front of our children. They said that we would teach them.

66
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:17,245
it turned out that when they start going into military service, since we have a lot of male children, we start living destroying our mental health because they abuse alcohol.

67
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:26,280
However, may a person live life without exacerbating things like that in these days.

68
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:37,635
And their warning of danger, that if we start being mischievous when our parents who teach us, when our elders teach us

69
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:42,065
If we start being mischievous without thought for anything

70
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:51,625
Stop paying attention to those who teach and instruct us, telling us to live well without hindering those among us

71
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,000
Instead, they said that we should be good, pleasant to be seen sitting in our homes.

72
00:08:57,005 --> 00:09:01,840
So, they said, that our house would be peaceful.

73
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:11,660
And if some guest who feels helpless comes in, try to make them feel at east, if we, you know, do not live mischievously.

74
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:22,685
When they said that, though we wanted to, yet we would sometimes come across things

75
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:27,535
We missed our desire to be good.

76
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:41,543
And these days, since these young people, our descendants, are now in great need of teachers these days because there’s not a lot of people

77
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:48,069
Since they want to hear instructions, I find that daunting.

78
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:57,170
We grew up, needing to listen to their traditional wisdom well like this

79
00:09:57,186 --> 00:10:08,019
Because they’ve already strated speaking through KYUK here, and those women instruct.

80
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:19,528
And those women, it seems that through their disregard for their husbands, they’re like knee guards through that

81
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:25,995
And we didn’t have different children [from different men], with our very own husband here.

82
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:35,196
They said that we only had children from our spouse, without adding any from others.

83
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:37,796
They said they were beautiful.

84
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:43,064
Oh my, I would want that, oh my goodness.

85
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:50,882
Here, we would be scared that we would be impregnated without our knowledge.

86
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:58,310
And it was very scary to become pregnant at a young age, to bring forth a child.

87
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:03,844
They said illegitimate are embarrassing. It was an admonishment.

88
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:10,263
Apprently, this was the mischief that our elders back then would talk about.

89
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:22,747
That import Western instruction these days is very good. Oh my, they’re so nice to hear. Caucasians make us feel nice.

90
00:11:23,694 --> 00:11:35,450
When we watch things on TV, when they inject people who are rowdy, including women, they would become very abnormal.

91
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:41,688
They become limp [sedated], and it seems they have no more [?] to me.

92
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:50,861
If some rowdy person comes upon them, it seems they wouldn’t be able to hold up with their strength.

93
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:59,599
You young people shouldn’t do bad things that are admonished against.

94
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:04,420
Do not follow what the West tells you to do too much

95
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:12,458
Also because they say these things, including marijuana, have substances and that they do not end well.

96
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,392
You shouldn’t use them.

97
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:17,707
Our life here is short.

98
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:27,710
Our youth and our time growing up seems close, yet we become weak like this and can’t do strenuous things.

99
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:34,643
That’s why you should be careful like that, not following only bad things.

100
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:43,334
If you live life doing housework, making money with enthusiasm, it will make us grateful.

101
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:51,328
But, use your money for yourselves, your houses, to help you with what you need.

102
00:12:52,011 --> 00:13:01,900
And now, since I don’t know how to speak English, I don’t hold it in high regard because I don’t use it.

103
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:14,292
Only when they really want me to, my spouse across there goes with me, he goes with me and I take something, because I have no idea how to give it.

104
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:20,641
I am thankful that I don’t know because I stay in peace.

105
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:29,252
Because the ones we watch say little, but we have probably said a lot by now.

106
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:37,268
If this is all for us, have what we said not become a lot?

107
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:38,596
Is that all?

108
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:41,738
This is all I want [to say].
