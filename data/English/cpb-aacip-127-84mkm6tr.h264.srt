1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,270
Ready?

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:23,100
Now, [tell us] a piece of traditional wisdom, or something that you want to leave with us...

3
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:29,375
I have trouble saying the word "paiciluki."

4
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:42,880
Pleae talk about one thing that is important to you that you want to leave with your children, or something you want people to remember.

5
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:52,810
Now, there is one thign that is important to me that I want you to remember.

6
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:59,665
If I want you to remember it, I would tell you now

7
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:09,565
This is one thing you should remember, you know, if you want to live a good life:

8
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:19,225
You shall not be your own master, even if you live as an adult like that.

9
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:27,520
You must have a mind, you must think of some belief.

10
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:35,855
You must believe in God’s will.

11
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:49,335
Then if you can’t do that, you must believe in Yup’ik instructions.

12
00:01:50,525 --> 00:02:02,325
It’s because if you live by yourself like that without faith, thinking you’re smart, thinking highly of yourself

13
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,800
I don’t know how you’ll end up.

14
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:15,712
Especially if you drink alcohol like that, or even if you smoke marijuana

15
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:23,494
Especially with you, I don’t know how you’ll end up.

16
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,675
However, if you live believing in one of those two

17
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:41,781
Believing what you hear from the Bible, knowing and believing that there is a god

18
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:51,331
If you’re going to live of your own accord like that, you will be hindered by the one who watches you.

19
00:02:52,456 --> 00:03:02,744
But if you don’t want to follow the church, listen to traditional Yup’ik wisdom.

20
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:07,319
If you try to obey and believe them as you live

21
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:22,774
And their traditional wisdom says that they revered the Spirit of the Universe, that [the Spirit] presided over everything

22
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:29,087
And they didn’t speak of God, but spoke of the Spirit of the Universe.

23
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:41,131
And of something wrong, they also said not to take anything that was not theirs behind a person.

24
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:47,544
They said that one like that would get into worse things.

25
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:52,895
They also said that a liar would also get into worse things.

26
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:57,494
That is traditional Yup’ik wisdom about what is dangerous.

27
00:03:57,957 --> 00:04:05,844
However, they said that one who tried not to do wrong does well and has a good future.

28
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:12,899
That’s why if you live with faith, you will live with strength.

29
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:18,349
So how was that? (Good, thank you.) Okay. How was it?

30
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,880
Were they over 20?

31
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:32,074
A little short, uh, they wer over twenty.

32
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:38,618
Haven’t you had great-granchildren? Do you have great-grandchildren.

33
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:40,950
I have two great-granchildren.

34
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:45,112
Okay, and where were you born?

35
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:49,969
Sheldon’s Point, at Nunam Iqua.

36
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:52,431
Here at the mouth of the Yukon.

37
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,625
So, when...

38
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:06,356
I probably am. I still have the lifetime certificate that I got.

39
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:13,631
You know, it’s not shown.

40
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:21,369
But, you know, when someone asks me, as I said, when someone asks me, I’d try to help.

41
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:32,788
Even to the people here who are like that around me, [?] when I can, I go to them.

42
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:37,288
Okay, that's probably enough.

43
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,025
More? (Mhm.) Okay.

44
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:52,269
You are a speaker when invited here, and YKHC also invites you when they have workshops.

45
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:56,457
With those, are you still active?

46
00:05:56,463 --> 00:06:02,088
Since they didn’t invite me here to YKHC

47
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:06,569
I think it's going to be three years since they've invited me.

48
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:12,182
Since they didn’t, I didn’t go. But I did go on the news by myself.

49
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:14,563
I’ve probably gone twice.

50
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:19,994
And once here, when KCC across there had an event...
