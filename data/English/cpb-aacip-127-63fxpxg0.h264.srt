1
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,790
Okay, I’m going to say what I want about these

2
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:23,485
These things when I was a boy, when we were boys

3
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:38,480
Our food that we hunt on land, sea animals, and these birds.

4
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,730
There are no more these days.

5
00:00:47,725 --> 00:01:00,275
These sea animals are becoming scarce, and these birds are also becoming scarce.

6
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:13,465
Back when we were boys, at least when I was a boy, there used to be a great many birds in the spring.

7
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:21,520
The wilderness was quiet. It wasn’t like this.

8
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:30,400
We wouldn’t hear anything rumbling like this at dawn, rumbling outside.

9
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:43,570
When they went to spring camps in the spring like this inland in the Akula region, it was wonderful with various birds calling.

10
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:58,825
And these hunters in the evening when evening was setting, they would spend the evenings hunting muskrats in the spring camps inland.

11
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:06,835
They would make loud pops, the air filled with gunshots like this everywhere.

12
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:16,985
And these birds, because they would camp in the spring on the shores of lakes inland

13
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,570
It was fun with the swimming birds calling.

14
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,830
It would be wonderful in the spring.

15
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:42,190
For what reason, when I think about it, are they gone since they don’t hunt them anymore?

16
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:58,235
We boys also had these lesson: we hunt these little birds.

17
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:01,645
There were a great many of them too.

18
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:09,060
We would hunt those little birds with arrows.

19
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:16,715
And, you know, we wouldn’t discard what we caught.

20
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:26,880
Also, these girls would pluck their feathers and cook them.

21
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:35,915
However, our mother would also cook what we caught without discarding them.

22
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:45,760
The people back then would respect and revere the food we got from the land like this.

23
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:52,225
Yet what are they doing these days?

24
00:03:52,255 --> 00:04:03,025
And our children do not hunt these little birds that we used to shoot arrows at.

25
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:13,225
What we used to hunt on the land here are no more to be seen.

26
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:27,030
And then when those in the trees hatched in the summer, there would be very many entering smoke houses.

27
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,665
We would also hunt with arrows.

28
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:46,355
We skinned the little things, opened them here on their chests, removed their flesh, and propped them on their wings here.

29
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:51,235
Then we tied them and hung them in the trees.

30
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:59,635
They called that nakaculiluki. That’s what they did.

31
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,590
There were a great many little birds without any change in population.

32
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Also, our caretakers

33
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:24,885
Starting from the spring until the birds went downriver like this, they would eat them as their food source including their eggs.

34
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:30,765
We wouldn’t hear anything about there being no more, or anything depleting.

35
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:39,065
But this is what happened: every year, something would have low numbers.

36
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:45,375
And sometimes, there would be a lot, occasionally decreasing.

37
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:49,055
But they wouldn’t be gone, wouldn’t be affected.

38
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:55,340
There were always a lot of birds and sea animals.

39
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:05,750
And then, they would eat those birds like this in the spring until there were fish.

40
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,280
They only stopped when they went downriver, stopped going out to hunt.

41
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:20,080
There was no one left like this in Akula, but [they were] down on the Kuskokwim.

42
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:27,380
They turned to the fish. There also a great many fish.

43
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:44,160
Through there reverence, because they are God’s gifts and they revered them, he always kept them at high numbers.

44
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:56,465
When I think on that these days, they would watch and be careful about whatever food they had.

45
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,990
There used to be a lot of fish across there when we were boys like this.

46
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,190
They would also bump each other to the riverbank here.

47
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:16,005
And sometimes when we were swimming, the fish would bump into us somewhere here.

48
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:26,835
Then these days, since we don’t revere them, there are no more of some things.

49
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:30,825
People back then revered them.

50
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:43,355
And then, our food sources are evidently connected to us humans.

51
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:53,570
And then during beluga hunting season, they would admonish us against wading in water when they were hunting beluga.

52
00:07:54,225 --> 00:08:01,725
On this side when we were across there, they would admonish us against wading in water.

53
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:09,270
They would admonish us like that, saying that they were hunting beluga.

54
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:18,075
And so, there are no more these days because we don’t hunt them anymore.

55
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:29,150
And there are no more of these little birds because we’re not hunting them with arrows anymore.

56
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:46,025
However, our Caucasian counterparts who regulate them are trying to raise bird populations by restricting us from hunting them.

57
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:53,586
Those who raised us back then didn’t stop hunting these birds.

58
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:58,881
After having them as a food source in the spring inland

59
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:11,349
And then, after they fished, when those birds couldn’t fly anymore as they molt, and the chicks

60
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:23,258
When their young were the same size, they would start hunting them, returning with full kayaks.

61
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:29,792
And they wouldn’t be affected, wouldn’t deplete.

62
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:37,022
Yet these days, there are no more of some things including little birds.

63
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:41,731
Or is it because we don’t hunt them anymore?

64
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,014
Well, that is all I have to say.

65
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:58,366
Then, you know, when traveling, you know back when they traveled

66
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:07,428
You know, should they get lots or something happens, what would they eat in the wilderness when they got hungry?

67
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:14,108
You mean when they got hungry without food?

68
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:21,088
Yes, you know, if they are lost in the wilderness with no food, what can they eat?

69
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:28,634
How would they do it, you know, in the winter or summer or sping or fall?

70
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:31,123
Okay.

71
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:48,111
People back then would instruct us like this if we had no food, or were in an unfortunate situation:

72
00:10:50,850 --> 00:11:04,361
If we have no food, one can have food like this:

73
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:15,806
These voles are food sources if he has nothing in the wilderness, but only if he has a fire.

74
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:20,481
Those can actually be food.

75
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:33,237
However, I also used to hear that ptarmigan feces can also be eaten as food. Those things.

76
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:43,034
You just asked me how they could eat if they had no food.

77
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:51,971
We see these voles in the winter.

78
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:59,491
Those can actually be food.

79
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,976
But also, if he has not eaten in a while, he should never eat raw meat.

80
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:14,597
Or as he’s traveling, if he hasn’t eaten in a long time

81
00:12:15,304 --> 00:12:28,559
If he comes upon a fish trap like this, you know the blackfish fries they call alungyaraat, he should never eat those.

82
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:35,800
They said that they would kill him through his stomach.

83
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:46,470
Being without food, but it’s worse to be thirsty.

84
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:54,163
If one gets into misfortune in his travels and is hungry and thirsty

85
00:12:54,176 --> 00:13:07,327
We are admonished that if we are tired, not to eat snow even if we’re thirsty.

86
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:21,963
They told us not to eat snow. They said we would kill ourselves. They said our heart would weaken if we ate snow like that.

87
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:37,032
However, if he does not have water, he should put a plastic bag inside here.

88
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:45,172
They would melt it in warmth. That’s how they would instruct them.

89
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:55,004
That’s also how it is down in the ocean if he gets into misfortune without water.

90
00:13:57,013 --> 00:14:02,485
His catch’s stomach, you know, its intestines...

91
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:06,313
(Anything?) What? (Anything he caught?)

92
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:12,211
Yes, the intestines of whatever he catches, a seal, a sea animal.

93
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:27,592
He should cut it to whatever length he wants and drain it. One should not drink at the first thought down in the ocean before water seeps out.

94
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:37,605
If he gets into misfortune, if there’s one of those around him

95
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:51,122
Cut its stomach or its long intestines into whatever length he wants, drain it, then put snow inside it.

96
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:56,587
Please start again.

97
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:59,646
Okay, about what I was just talking about

98
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:09,016
After draining the sea animals intestines, put snow inside it.

99
00:15:09,814 --> 00:15:20,792
And then, they said to put it into the warm spot here, but not touching his skin.

100
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,221
It will melt here, tying its ends like this.

101
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:32,390
They say that’s how they get water down in the ocean if they get into misfortune.

102
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:44,936
However, if he gets to misfortun here on land or sinks into water

103
00:15:50,292 --> 00:16:01,733
If it’s cold, even if it’s cold, he should take off his clothes right away if he can before they freeze.

104
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:10,148
He should quickly wring his clothes to make them better, and put them on.

105
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:22,693
And when he puts them on, if there’s grass, he should fill and line them.

106
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:26,858
Including the area down here.

107
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:40,620
This is an instruction when it’s cold. But, they are told to continually fold these here, including these like this.

108
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:54,059
However, they said that if he stays still and freezes, when these can’t move anymore, he will not be able to walk.

109
00:16:54,282 --> 00:17:00,737
And if these also freeze, he won’t be able to move.

110
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:13,857
They would instruct us to do that if we didn’t have anything around us to save us.

111
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:21,368
We should keep doing this with these [arms] in the cold, and these [legs], if we’re not moving.

112
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:31,132
There are many ways to get into misfortune here on land.

113
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,778
He should do whatever he can.

114
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:38,919
And then, they would also instruct us like this:

115
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:49,487
If we are traveling in the extreme cold and suddenly fall

116
00:17:50,632 --> 00:17:59,765
If we do not immediately go under the ice, depending on if we do not sink in

117
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:08,781
You know, after we do that, if we are unable [to do anything else]

118
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:16,201
Do this with our glove to make it stick [to the ice].

119
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:23,631
Keep that stuck, occassionally doing this.

120
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:36,964
If it would not come off, he will be able to get out of the water by pulling that like this if he is able to come out.

121
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:46,291
There is a lot of traditional wisdom about getting into misfortune.

122
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:58,602
They said that if we get into misfortune, you know, not to panic and try to hastily save ourselves.

123
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:04,247
They said that if we try [too hastily], we will kill ourselves.

124
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:18,981
And in the water here, when we travel, we should observe the water for what can save us.

125
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:28,465
They also told us to observe how to use these waves. That’s how they instructed us.

126
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:37,625
He must only physically travel through his being observant.

127
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:47,959
And, you just asked me about being without food.

128
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:57,864
But I do not know what to do if one does not have anything.

129
00:19:58,683 --> 00:20:08,189
But if he has skin clothes that can be eaten

130
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:16,841
If he has a fire, he should char it, not eat it raw.

131
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:24,000
If he hasn’t eaten in a long time, that will save him.

132
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:38,322
They would instruct us that it’s safe to put ptarmigan feces into the snow and eat it.

133
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:43,704
We used to try those when we were boys.

134
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:52,373
We would eat ptarmigan feces like that.

135
00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:59,483
After putting them in snow, we would try eating them.

136
00:21:00,022 --> 00:21:03,055
Because that’s traditional wisdom. What?

137
00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:04,333
Were they okay?

138
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:17,089
They were good, they were okay, because of these trees, because they eat these trees

139
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:26,742
Because they eat plants, and lowbush cranberries, and Labrador tea, and the top parts of trees.

140
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:38,489
They were okay. Those are not admonished against. There’s nothing dangerous in ptarmigan feces.

141
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:40,701
That’s all.

142
00:21:41,898 --> 00:21:44,110
Do you have any other thoughts?

143
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:44,821
What?

144
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:48,477
Do you have any other thoughts?

145
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,095
Can you stop recording for a while?

146
00:21:54,944 --> 00:21:56,677
Is it time to start? (Yes.)

147
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:06,530
Okay, so to you who are listening these days

148
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:14,279
I’m going to speak about what’s been on my mind and what I’ve experienced.

149
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:30,732
These things: the sun, and what becomes visible, appears, before the sun in the morning

150
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:40,980
When they become visible these days, we say they appear, and they appear when they come into view.

151
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:45,772
The sun rises across there

152
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:58,094
If we’re here toward the water on the Kuskokwim.

153
00:22:58,164 --> 00:23:11,858
The Kuskokwim down there is on the side, with the west cutting into it inland.

154
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:28,223
If he gets into misfortune somewhere here, or if he’s lost, if it gets cloudy, if a blizzard sets, or gets foggy

155
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:42,029
If it’s night, or he has absolutely no idea where he is, and he doesn’t know where the Kuskokwim is

156
00:23:42,895 --> 00:23:45,251
Being completely lost.

157
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:54,002
Three of us experienced that when we were going to Newtok.

158
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:03,858
But before this, I used to observe the sun and moon.

159
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:12,602
It doesn’t rise anywhere else. It rises across there, a ways upriver across the Kuskokwim.

160
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:22,808
And then, before it gets too high, it goes above the Kuskokwim.

161
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:28,063
It goes downriver toward the ocean.

162
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:42,482
And then when it goes above the ocean, our ocean odown there, toward our ocean, it finally goes up there.

163
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:46,134
It goes without going any higher.

164
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:56,780
And then when it goes across toward the land, it goes down to disappear on the land here.

165
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:06,710
The moon and the sun.

166
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:15,590
And then, you know, the Big Dipper (Qaluurin), you know it. You talk about the Big Dipper.

167
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,777
Do you know it?

168
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:24,840
We used to refer to the Big Dipper as Tunturyuk. Tunturyuk.

169
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:39,777
It’s like Erenret Iquat [?constellation?] points them to a certain direction, like it faces a direction for them.

170
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:50,861
When the sun sets, you will observe that it faces Erenret Iquat.

171
00:25:51,451 --> 00:26:01,973
And then it goes over there, goes through the area across there on the other side.

172
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:10,260
And then when it gets close to the ocean there, it bends down.

173
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:20,504
As soon as it bends down, Erenret [Iquat] appear, and the area toward the sun brightens.

174
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:25,248
I also used that to find my bearings.

175
00:26:25,277 --> 00:26:36,510
And at that time, you know, as we were coming from Newtok, our compass was bad and broken.

176
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:39,508
We had apparently gone upriver.

177
00:26:40,987 --> 00:26:46,832
We thought we were going down to the ocean as it was getting dark.

178
00:26:51,023 --> 00:27:03,067
When we thought we were going to the ocean, we backtracked and went to the land. We had no idea where we were.

179
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:11,224
We set up a tent and went to bed as it started getting wet.

180
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:27,441
And then as we were sleeping, I opened my eyes, and the tent was a little bright, also because it was warm.

181
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:34,818
I faced it and found that it was cold, and it seemed bright up there.

182
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:48,223
Because the tent had a little hold, after doing this with my forefinger, I saw that the moon was over there.

183
00:27:48,344 --> 00:27:51,826
I finally understood where we were.

184
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:56,125
The Kuskokwim was down there.

185
00:27:57,648 --> 00:28:02,337
We woke up.

186
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:11,846
And then, even though we didn’t know where we were, I told my companions that we were going to go toward the Kuskokwim.

187
00:28:12,506 --> 00:28:16,917
So, we went toward the Kuskokwim.

188
00:28:19,728 --> 00:28:33,627
Also, that river among the hills that we called Qurrlurnat, we thought that we would recognize it.

189
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:39,478
And as we went, we recognized things.

190
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:49,734
That’s why they would instruct us to observing everything on the land as we went.

191
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:54,578
We should always make them landmarks.

192
00:28:54,614 --> 00:29:00,403
Also, we should always find our bearings with these [willows with red bark].

193
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:10,214
And the things toward land, when it’s good, when it goes to our home villages, use those to find our bearings.

194
00:29:10,813 --> 00:29:18,513
Also, we should know where ponds or elevated areas are here.

195
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,491
That’s how we were instructed.

196
00:29:22,524 --> 00:29:38,824
They said that if we happen to recognize it, even when the weather’s bad, we will know which direction and where our home villages are.

197
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:55,543
That’s why those who raised us back then would tell to always be observant as we traveled like this. We should always observe everything.

198
00:29:56,868 --> 00:30:07,131
And when it gets clear at night, mark where the stars above are.

199
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:19,143
Or if a star is in the direction of a village, that village will be [marked as being] there.

200
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:24,656
But, they also wouldn’t stay in their houses all the time.

201
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:37,856
They would gauge it when traveling in a certain dirionction, using those stars to get their bearings like that.

202
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:42,756
We experienced it like that.

203
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:48,375
We eventually reached placed we recognized.

204
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,975
And it was even foggy when we traveled.

205
00:30:52,019 --> 00:31:05,631
But with that moon, I knew which way the Kuskokwim was.

206
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:16,644
And I told my companions this: if we run out of fuel, we will walk down to the Kuskokwim.

207
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:22,113
And yet the Kuskowkim was gone because it was foggy.

208
00:31:22,326 --> 00:31:26,126
I said a plane would see us down...
