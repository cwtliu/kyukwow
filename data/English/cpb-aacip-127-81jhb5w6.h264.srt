1
00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:07,379
Now, Junior has three children.

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,269
Greet me with a handshake.

3
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:16,642
It’s been so long since I’ve seen you.

4
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:26,655
By your estimation, how many great-grandchildren would you have?

5
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:35,404
There are five now, five. Five [?].

6
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:40,052
When will some of them [have children]?

7
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,196
How old were you when you became a pastor, serve as a pastor?

8
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,369
When did we first move here again?

9
00:00:56,378 --> 00:00:59,568
Nineteen-sixty-nine here.

10
00:00:59,572 --> 00:01:01,552
I became a pastor.

11
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:11,995
As a lay pastor, your, you know, reverend...

12
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:18,982
Now, with your observation of Nanvarnarrlak

13
00:01:18,992 --> 00:01:27,672
Tell us a story about what the people of Nanvarnarrlak was like looking at your guardian.

14
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,839
Without stopping? (Yes, without stopping.)

15
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:35,757
Do I start now? (Yes.)

16
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,469
Okay, thank you. So, I’ll do what I want.

17
00:01:38,477 --> 00:01:40,097
Yes, you’ll do what you want.

18
00:01:43,248 --> 00:01:54,926
In Nanvarnarrlak, but I can’t say what year when I was very young at that time

19
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:01,358
And since I wasn’t a student, I only learned by watching them

20
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:08,052
When we got that pastor, Neck, Uyaquq [in Yup’ik].

21
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:11,216
He was Lloyd Nick.

22
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:24,142
I first saw him preaching in Nanvarnarrlak in a house.

23
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:31,059
But afterwards, I’d watch him preach in the community house.

24
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:36,747
People would gather. Since they had no bell, they’d [personally] invite people.

25
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:41,538
Those who were able would gather people from villages.

26
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:47,083
And with Uyaquq’s orthography...

27
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:51,493
How I wish I could show you.

28
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:59,989
Uyaquq would read the Bible in his own orthography.

29
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:07,587
That was the first I heard of the Bible, and there was no one before him.

30
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:15,581
And those who raised and my grandmothers had no Bibles.

31
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:19,594
And I hadn’t heard anyone reading the Bible.

32
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:34,535
Before I saw him reading, his pupil arrived at night.

33
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:44,057
My grandmother told me to turn clockwise this way in what she called looking for a story [forecast].

34
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:50,024
I would have to go tell her about the weather that I saw.

35
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:55,031
And she told me to know where the wind was blowing from.

36
00:03:57,298 --> 00:04:02,898
When I was in a hurry, I said

37
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:12,611
"When I went out, I looked out to the right like this.

38
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:23,385
"Then when I looked toward the river, and there was a small tent at night.

39
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:26,141
"It had two drapes."

40
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:36,066
Then since I was barefoot, I didn’t make a sound as I went down to see the small tent’s entrance.

41
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:42,420
When it came into my view, it was closed, the flaps crossing like this.

42
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:51,029
Then right when I saw it, I stood in front of it from a distance.

43
00:04:57,317 --> 00:05:04,517
When I stood still, the person inside started like this, and it was the first time I heard the Bible:

44
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:13,226
"Respect for the Lord will be the beginning of knowledge.

45
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:22,192
"But those without sense do not care for knowledge and teaching.

46
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:28,561
"My child, obey your father’s instruction

47
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:33,927
"And do not leave your mother’s command

48
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:45,861
"Because they will be writing in your head that will bring you joy, and they will be a necklace around your neck."

49
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:56,125
As soon as I became a priest, I found it in Proverbs chapter 1, verses 7-9.

50
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:01,629
What I’d heard was there.

51
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:08,288
Then when he was done in there, I ran right home.

52
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:14,939
Since I was barefoot, I didn’t make a sound. You see, he probably didn’t hear me.

53
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:27,520
And when I went inland through the path past our house, I stopped when I reached a deeper area.

54
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:33,563
"Well now, let me try what I heard down there."

55
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:44,999
I faced the tundra, while the graves inland were visible, I faced it and tried it.

56
00:06:45,244 --> 00:06:51,074
"Respect for the Lord will be the beginning of knowledge.

57
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:58,202
"But those without sense do not care for knowledge and teaching.

58
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:03,664
"My child, obey your father’s instruction

59
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:08,531
"And do not leave your mother’s command

60
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:19,571
"Because they will be writing in your head that will bring you joy, and they will be a necklace around your neck."

61
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:35,770
I apparently learned the Bible outside by that door, watching that door and listening to the person inside.

62
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:42,611
I can’t forget it as I’m alive here.

63
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:51,626
Also because I found it in Proverbs chapter 1, verses 7-9.

64
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:57,107
I also learned what I [later] found without paper.

65
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:12,019
Now, when I became a priest, they had me move a lot over many years.

66
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:18,362
Before that, they’d also sent me as a pastor.

67
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:29,688
But I would use that verse more than once because it was the first one I learned.

68
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:38,781
The first [?pektesta] I saw was Robert from Akiak.

69
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:44,281
I forgot his Yup’ik name. I did know it.

70
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:57,288
He arrived, saying that my father invited him to eat when he was at Uyaquq’s house.

71
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:07,083
Puciinaaq, Puciinaaq said because [s]he speaks up that [s]he will go with him.

72
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:18,018
Then my father said to him, "You’ll be embarrassing when he eats. I’m going to have him eat frozen aged whitefish."

73
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:32,127
Then Aalaaq shook his head. He said he’ll follow. He said he wants to see our house.

74
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:42,356
It was a sod house from the land sicne we had the first houses, with no wooden houses.

75
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:47,938
Then he came in and sat down.

76
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:57,703
Then when he ate further in from him, he was speaking because Puciinaaq spoke Yup’ik.

77
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:04,134
He could manage to speak, speak in Yup’ik.

78
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:18,164
Then when he was done drinking something ate after Robert ate

79
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:31,512
When he was done, he took and opened his book bag and said, "I’m going to teach you."

80
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:49,904
Without mentioning the chapter, he held and opened the book used for Easter. He was looking at, but I wasn’t looking at it.

81
00:10:50,316 --> 00:11:01,666
Then he said that he’s now going to teach me something that I shouldn’t forget.

82
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:07,198
And he told me to stand. So I stood and faced him.

83
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:16,125
But, I’d never forgotten what I’d seen as a little boy.

84
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:23,929
Then across there, he said that he’s now going to begin teaching me.

85
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:29,797
He didn’t mention the chapter and verse.

86
00:11:31,352 --> 00:11:34,240
Then he started like this:

87
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:46,940
"Jesus proclaimed, "One who believes in me does not believe in me, but to the one who sent me.

88
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:52,136
"’And one who sees me sees the father.

89
00:11:52,148 --> 00:12:00,873
"’I came to this land as a light so that one who believes in me will not be in darkness.

90
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:10,388
"’And one who hears my word and does not believe then, [s]he will be tried.

91
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:18,233
"’The word will try that person in the last day.

92
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:26,463
"’That’s why when I speak, I speak like that as my father told me to.’"

93
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:30,793
And that was end of his lesson.

94
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:36,352
I learned all of it.

95
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:41,561
I became able to preach without a paper.

96
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:49,519
And I first learned a song written in Uyaquq’s orthography.

97
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:59,999
These were the words, and without them teaching me, I learned it by listening:

98
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:11,925
"We are thankful for you, they are thankful [in Heaven] up there

99
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:24,134
"Because you can manage anything, and because you are compassionate."

100
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:28,660
Apparently, I’d learned the writing then.

101
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:32,730
I started reading this book used for Easter.

102
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:42,328
I also learned Uyaquq’s orthography, and could even read them.

103
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:55,751
It turned out that when I would become a priest, I could do my work without papers.

104
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:05,651
Uyaquq wrote an intention saying this:

105
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:15,702
"God said, ’Do not falter. Open your ears and listen.

106
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:20,690
"’Everything comes from above.

107
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:29,613
"’Even a tiny insect on the land is created from above.

108
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:37,734
"’Oh Christian, be slow to speak, and be slow to anger.

109
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:45,736
"’First, test what you are going to say three times.

110
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,428
"’If a person will not take offense from them, speak them."

111
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:55,587
I [learned] these without paper.

112
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:07,796
I wasn’t a student, but the Lord had me learn this much without papers.

113
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:21,534
He let me learn that song, these [songs] that the Moravians translated, and even let me learn them.

114
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:37,891
Also, when I was getting checked at the hospital, I read the Catholic Bible, their Revelations.

115
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:48,405
Those were written in the new orthography that they spoke of.

116
00:15:48,859 --> 00:16:00,534
It turned out that when I saw them, because they were written by the next generation of translators, I would also read them.

117
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:07,529
I learned [how to read] them when I read Revelations.

118
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:21,684
I learned the ones written by the Catholics. And since it’s updated now, I wasn’t shocked, but could read them.

119
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,664
Because I learned them then.

120
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:38,231
It turned out that the Lord had me [learn] these things I needed to for my work.

121
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:50,740
Now, when we had the first books before the changed the first ones

122
00:16:51,028 --> 00:17:01,290
Without any books, I would go baptize and lead communions using those first ones.

123
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:09,960
Though I can recite them now, I started reading from the later ones.

124
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:19,565
I’m thankful for all I did.

125
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:30,314
Also, I would know nothing, being able to cry having become a reindeer herder.

126
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:36,629
They said I was now a reindeer herder and had me put on a brand here.

127
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:42,299
When the lower authority put the brand on me, he said this:

128
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:50,620
"Everywhere you go, take this brand with you. It’s a fish."

129
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,069
What’s a miluqutaq?

130
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:57,965
A rope for reindeer herding.

131
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:10,546
When they take reindeer, they would brand it with a mark to indicate who it belongs to.

132
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:20,950
So that you will recognize it, let me say one thing.

133
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:33,256
The moravians had a mark by removed the tips of reindeer ears so that they would recognize it if it acts strangley from afar.

134
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:41,304
They also gave me a mark for me to learn.

135
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:45,816
They didn’t let me forget it.

136
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:53,437
Then a knife, he gave me a belt and hung it here.

137
00:18:54,222 --> 00:19:01,472
That belt was made of hide and had straps to tie it with.

138
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:08,455
Then the one who put it on my measured my waist.

139
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:12,078
He told me my waist length.

140
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:22,478
He said that if a blizzard sets or the weather turns bad on me, that I must travel wearing the belt.

141
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:31,913
And if there’s a blizzard, the blowing snow wouldn’t go in my [clothes] here. I would have to do that.

142
00:19:32,193 --> 00:19:46,943
Then when he let go of that belt, he said this when he put the knife here:

143
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:51,736
"Take it everywhere you go.

144
00:19:51,767 --> 00:20:00,242
"If you leave it somewhere and go, if you forget it and go

145
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:15,207
"It will, you know, you will have misfortune, and have nothing to gather grass for matting."

146
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:24,110
Then I would always bring those three things that I owned.

147
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:34,667
That’s why had I not herded reindeer, I would be lost when taking care of God’s sheep.

148
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:41,411
Back then, I apparently learned how I could take care of God’s sheep.

149
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:47,325
The lower authority admonished; let me say this last thing

150
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:55,633
He said I shouldn’t hurt the reindeer. He said it has a spirit.

151
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:06,186
Or, I should not shoot it, or I should not somehow hurt it.

152
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:12,954
He said it has a spirit. He said it’s spirit is watching me, will watch me.

153
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:19,814
It turned out that when we took care of God’s sheep, I remembered that.

154
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:28,903
I eve respected them, and feared speaking to them wrong

155
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:33,837
Because God’s sheep have spirits.

156
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:40,738
I think it’s gotten long, so this is all I want to say.

157
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,882
Yes, okay.

158
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:53,138
Many times, if you listen to me, it will be beneficial to you since I did it when I was very young.

159
00:21:53,270 --> 00:22:01,595
I experienced these without forgetting them, but knowing them.

160
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:04,504
Thank you very much. (Yes, thank you.)

161
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:18,238
Back when you heard Uyaquq reading Proverbs, how old did you seem back then?

162
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:25,636
When I stood to the reindeer, I cried.
