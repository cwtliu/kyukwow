1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I don’t know. We should explain the meaning behind that.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,400
I don’t know the meaning behind that because I’ve never done that.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,900
We from the upper Nushagak River also do that.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,500
When we catch these dangerous animals upriver

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
When we first catch bears, black bears, those things

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:36,500
The blood of that dangerous animal we caught, we open its mouth

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,900
We reach in and take its saliva.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,000
And then after putting it on our hands, we apply it to our faces.

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,00
They say that when that bear sees us

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,000
When they see us living as themselves through that [saliva]

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They will will not come to us and attack us like this.

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:12,900
They respect [and acknowledge] their saliva that we applied on our faces.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
That’s what it’s like.

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,500
They do that and should not be afraid of it.

15
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Okay, we asked the original question about the ritual of getting the first seal.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It’s been a long time since they’ve stopped doing that since they’ve turned to these priests.

17
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
It’s been a long time since they’ve stopped.

18
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,900
Explaining the meaning behind it,

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,500
I am going to explain, talk about the reason that they have started doing that.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,500
They say that a long time ago, people didn’t do that.

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:05,500
But that child whose father sent him away in those bladders

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,000
When they sent him, he stayed there for a year.

23
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,500
When he was there with the living creatures, the seals

24
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,900
When he returned only after [the year] of his stay had passed

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,500
That child had them start doing that.

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,000
He had them start giving water to those seals [they had caught].

27
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,500
During his time, they had started doing that [to seals].

28
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,000
When he was a child, he had gone where those living creatures go over there, staying with them

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,500
And he only returned after a year, when a year had passed.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He only came [back] when his trip had passed. That [child].

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He had them start [giving water] to [seals].

32
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:14,500
When people catch those seals, they don’t discard their bladders but inflate them.

33
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,000
They inflated every bladder from those seals and kept them all summer.

34
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,900
And when fall came, they deflated them

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Sending them with the current under the ice.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,500
And so, they would do that to the bladder of the seals they had caught.

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,400
I think its spirit is there.

38
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
It seems they think it’s inside its bladder.

39
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
They say that [the seal] returns the next year.

40
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,000
That’s what those people used to say.

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:54,500
They say that the ones who had caught those bladders, they return to the ones who caught them.

42
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,500
They apparently thought that that's what they did.

43
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,500
They would ask them to come again when they sent off the bladders during the Bladder Festival.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,800
They say that that…

45
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,500
Later. Let me translate this first.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,900
Kurt Bell…

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
…the shaman [send] the child of that couple.

48
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:31,500
In the past, that couple’s children wouldn’t stay alive. They kept dying.

49
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,500
And then, one of their children.

50
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:45,400
That shaman wanted to do that to their2 child, include him with the bladders being sent.

51
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,900
That shaman had hit to do that.

52
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Send him to the land of those living creatures.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He, however, saw the land of those living creatures as a house.

54
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,500
When he arrived at the land of these seals in the winter.

55
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:14,000
They said that some of them picked on him, the one who was sent with the bladders.

56
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,000
Those seals and spotted seals were different there.

57
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Yet, they said that some of them treated him with love.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They said that when he started hunting after he returned

59
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:36,000
He would recognize those spotted or ringed seals.

60
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,000
He recognized them like us people.

61
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,000
They said that when he started hunting then, because he recognized them

62
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,000
He would strongly shoot them with arrows.

63
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,500
He shot them with arrows and harpooned them hard because he recognized them.

64
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,000
That's what that's like.

65
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,000
He expanded on that thing about boy going out to the seals.

66
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,400
There was a man and a wife whose children would not live.

67
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,000
They kept dying and dying [?]

68
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,000
And so, this one child [?]

69
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,000
[?] that child with a bladder out to the sea.

70
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,000
And so, that’s what he did.

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And, and then that boy…

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,500
…he traveled there like that to them to do that to them.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, he…

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
…they didn’t do it very excessively.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But you probably don’t know those that do that.

76
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,900
I understand it. (I see).

77
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
Whats he's saying is that those people that were,

78
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Or, those seals that he recognized that were good to him,

79
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,500
He made sure that he made a good clean kill.

80
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,000
You know, really made sure that he did that.

81
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,500
It seems like this was a really important ceremony to go through.

82
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Why did they stop doing that after Caucasians arrived?

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,500
When the priests appeared, they stopped doing that. (Yes).

84
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,000
Only when these priests appeared

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,500
Because these priests appeared

86
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,000
They forsook that and stopped doing it.

87
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,000
I see. Like this? Which of these2?

88
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,000
Were they ashamed of it or did they tell youpl to stop?

89
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Though they weren’t told to stop, they stopped doing that.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Their practice with a seal

91
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
They stopped adhering to their practice.

92
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I’ll do one, and I hear something different over there.

93
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But Kurt Bell says that after the missionaries came, they stopped on their own.

94
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
May I say something?

95
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,500
Yes. (Okay).

96
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:32,500
In what they said, yes, to the bear’s faces, black bears or brown bears

97
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,000
It’s mouth, they take [saliva] from its mouth and apply it to its face.

98
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,900
When I was a boy…

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Who are you? (Edward Weiss).

100
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
My grandfather used to tell me this:

101
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,100
After shooting and killing a black bear

102
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:06,000
And then like that, I should get saliva from inside [its mouth] and appy it to my face and my hands.

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And then said this to me: when I grow up and start hunting

104
00:09:17,00 --> 00:09:27,000
Should an injured black bear or those brown bears take me

105
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,000
It will see my face with its saliva on it.

106
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,500
He said that that’s why it won’t breathe on me.

107
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:46,500
Their breath, black bear saliva is extremely potent on people.

108
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,500
That’s why they evidently kill people by breathing on them like this and making their faces swell.

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,500
He said that it won’t do that to me.

110
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:02,500
And then after that when I had reached a certain age, 25

111
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I missed a killing shot on a brown bear and it took me, took my gun like this.

112
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:18,000
However, it didn’t breathe on my face, but turned like this and breathed.

113
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,000
That’s what they instructed, even now.

114
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Just now [?]

115
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Okay, that’s [?] why from up the Kuskokwim. He said when his grandfather…

116
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,500
As [s]he imagines you older men

117
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,500
You apparently respect, qigcikluki, animals that we hunt.

118
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
[S]he said that now, in your opinions

119
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:08,000
Do yourpl descendants do that as youpl are?

120
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Or are they not doing that?

121
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,500
If they’re not, [s]he’s asking if youpl think that the animals we hunt will decline.

122
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,000
Now, I…

123
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,000
…I am going to briefly [leave] her question.

124
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:38,000
I am not worried about the depletion of these seals, the animals down from the ocean that we hunt

125
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:48,000
But these chicks, eggs, of these birds.

126
00:11:49,500 --> 00:12:00,000
I admonish my children, my offspring when their chicks hatch:

127
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,500
Do not hunt when they are chicks, when they are young.

128
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But even when they hatch, their mothers, when their chicks are small and young like this

129
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,500
I admonish them against hunting them.

130
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:32,500
Those young and my children are probably like those chicks.

131
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,000
That’s why I admonish them

132
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Even though the [chicks] when the birds’ eggs hatch are not my children.

133
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,500
And when they’re getting larger, if someone takes them away to tame them, is apparently going to take them away

134
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:57,000
I will admonish him against killing them all, including the mother [and father].

135
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,000
I tell them not to kill the mother [and father] saying that their chicks will have no one to take care of them anymore.

136
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I tell them that these seagulls cannot be taken care of by anything else.

137
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I tell them that they are young and pitiful should they lose their mothers, their caretakers.

138
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,000
I admonish them about that.

139
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, he says that for him, he doesn’t think that there’s not much danger to the seals right now.

140
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:49,000
But he tells his children about the birds that, when birds have this, you know, when the eggs start hatching

141
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,000
And the mothers [?]

142
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,500
And then it’s no different.

143
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
We used to hunt, and then our mothers would rever our catch.

144
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,500
They were very thankful for it.

145
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,500
And now, we who have become fathers, and she who is a mother knows them because she has sons

146
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,900
When her son catches ptarmigans, she is very thankful for them and welcomes them.

147
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,900
She doesn’t think it’s too little.

148
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
She is thankful for and reveres all of his catches.

149
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:38,000
She doesn’t leave them scattered or doesn’t let them go to the [?] as we were always admonished. That’s all.

150
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,500
Now, these days…

151
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
…I don’t know that.

152
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:54,000
We mothers, you see, [who are] young[er than you] have no one to instruct us.

153
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:04,500
Would it be well if you had them instruct here on the KYUK news?

154
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,000
Or, give them time to instruct us.

155
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,500
We have many children who are trying to make a living. We don’t know.

156
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
I am also leaving my children in the dark.

157
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It’s because I’ve never heard them since I lost my mother so long ago.

158
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,000
I like when these old people speak. They are true.

159
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,000
It’s still [practiced] now, but it’s disappearing.

160
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,000
The Western teachings that have appeared are eclipsing them.

161
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,000
It would be well if our Caucasian partners gave us time.

162
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:53,000
If an elder speaks on KYUK radio or on the news, teaching our children, [s]he will help us.

163
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:03,000
We would be thankful if they gave them time, and they would learn a lot.

164
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,700
Thank you, Larissa.

165
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
When we’re going to hunt, they instruct us concerning black bears…

166
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They tell us to make a walking staff out of wood.

167
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
…a walking stick is useful in the fall for thin ice or dangerous things.

168
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,000
That was an instruction back then for the people up north.

169
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,000
When we’re going to hunt in the mountains, in the grass, or when we travel

170
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
They told us to keep holding that walking staff.

171
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,500
And as we travel, a black bear will eventually attack us.

172
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,500
They say that these black bears are like people.

173
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,500
They take things with their forepaws like this.

174
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:19,500
They say that before it takes our gun, we should immediate give it a staff.

175
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,500
They said that that will save us.

176
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,500
We give it, it will take it, and we will shoot it.

177
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,000
That was a long time ago.

178
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
…we had shamans, we apparently had shamans

179
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,500
We call those superstitions.

180
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes, we say they are superstitious, originating from shamans.

181
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Wait, I don’t understand that. Piciruiq?

182
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,500
You know, that’s not real and originates from shamans.

183
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,000
We say that shamans are of the devil.

184
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,000
When we acquired faith in God

185
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,000
Many of those and traditional medicines are forsaken.

186
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,000
They’re forsaken.

187
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And now in our village down among the coastal people

188
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:36,000
We haven’t forsaken the practice [surrounding] catching seals.

189
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:52,000
When this person, even if he’s not young, catches the first seal in the spring, having also caught one the previous year

190
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
When the first one who goes seal hunting catches the first [seal]

191
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
They always distrubute that seal, uqiqurluni as we call it.

192
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:12,900
Every part of the first seal that he catches is distributed to everyone including what meat it has.

193
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,500
The first [catch], even if he's not young.

194
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,500
Every single year, we still haven’t forsaken that to this day.

195
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:35,000
When they bring that seal on land and [butcher] it into pieces, they distribute all of it, including what meat it has.

196
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,000
That’s what they call uqiqurluteng.

197
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:46,000
That [?first] catch, we also [?]

198
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's what happens. We haven't forsaken it.

199
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,000
You see, [we do] that in our village.

200
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When this person catches the first seal, the women of the village wait eagerly.

201
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
And not only its meat.

202
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,000
They include other things to its blubber.

203
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
[?]

204
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And pieces of cloth.

205
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:23,000
They don’t give it by itself, but add Western things to it [?].

206
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay, he’s also responding to your earlier question if those rituals are still…

207
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,500
For him, this, Phillip Moses from Toksook Bay said

208
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:44,000
They still do the first seal, not only the first young man seal, but the first beaded seal of the season.

209
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:52,500
What they still do is, they still, the women look forward to this.

210
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,500
They cut the bearded seal up into blubber and meat

211
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:06,000
And then they call the whole village to come for the share of the whole thing.

212
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
So, they don’t keep it for themselves.

213
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,000
What they do is they give it away to everybody else in the village.

214
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
And not just the pieces of the seal,

215
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,500
But they also today include, like, things they buy from the store:

216
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Pieces of cloth, or crackers, or whatever, you know, whatever…

217
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
She asked the reason behind giving that bearded seal to the others.

218
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,000
This is their tradition:

219
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
When the first one catches a seal in the spring like this, he wants to eat those bearded seals.

220
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,00
Because they want to eat

221
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:03,000
Back then, since they did it for them, they don’t [eat] bearded seals in the winter like this.

222
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,500
The meaning behind what she asked is showing love for each other.

223
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,000
Its meaning is love for each other. Yes.

224
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,000
Yes, that. That’s what it is. It’s love.

225
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay, you asked for the reason for this sharing, you know?

226
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
He said, Phillip Moses said…

227
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
…we were going to work on showing reverence from 10-12.

228
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I’m going to talk a little since it’s nearing 12 o’clock.
