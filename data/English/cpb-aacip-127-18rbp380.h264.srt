1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
And when we washed their clothes, our mothers had us separate the mens’ clothes.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,400
They also had us separate we women's’ clothes

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Because they were respectfully careful with them.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,500
As you’ve said, they did this because of their hunting.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:26,500
Women's’ clothes would have to be washed separately only with women’s clothes.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,000
I also used to do that. I do that because I have a lot of male children.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:43,500
And then, they wouldn't wash the men's clothes in the water where the women's were washed.

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,400
They were supposed to wash men’s clothes in new water.

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,400
The instructed us to take care of them without mixing them like this out of respect.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
One day, I asked, “Why do you have them do this?”

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,000
I used to ask my mother about things I didn’t know.

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,800
And then my mother said this to me:

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,700
She said, as youpl just did now

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:20,000
They are [washed] like this because of their hunting, because of their subsistence in the wilderness.

15
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,800
I wanted to talk about what I understood because we’re2 running out of time.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,500
And then we women who take care of food

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,500
We respected what the men caught, animals with fur, no matter what they were, took care of what the men caught out of respect.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We tried to adhere to that instruction.

19
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,000
We didn’t pollute nature with them.

20
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:04,000
We didn’t take care of them to pollute nature with the bones, scraps, or guts of what they caught.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:17,500
I asked my mother about everything. I asked about them because I didn’t have a lot of relatives.

22
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,500
And then she would say this to me:

23
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:34,400
“If I pollute nature with what my spouse catches, he will become a bad hunter, and he will not catch anything from the wilderness.”

24
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:45,500
She said that if I pollute nature with them, that will happen, animals will no longer come to him.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,500
And I believed them. I believed that that would happen to them.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:10,400
I also just talked about we women’s subsistence because we weren’t sedentary, we also had gathering spots in the wilderness because we subsisted.

27
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:21,000
They told us not to go to people’s gathering spots out of respect

28
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:29,000
We should show respect for that person’s gathering spot in case they would be offended.

29
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:37,000
We tried to go to our own gathering spots, not random places.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,500
I also used to hear people talk

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:01,400
They said that they wouldn’t put what hunters caught where they would spoil around that fish trap or drift net area.

32
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:19,000
They said that if food spoils aroudn that drift net area, fish will be short the next year.

33
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,000
It would have as much [as it usually does].

34
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,000
And that fish trap that is set in that creek

35
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:40,000
They said the fisher respectfully watches over that creek. He doesn’t want anything to spoil there because he fishes there.

36
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,000
They said that if any animal spoils there around that fish trap

37
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,000
It would have as much fish as it used to catch the next year.

38
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,000
You see, we didn't doubt those back then.

39
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:07,400
The people back then respected everything, even the wilderness and land.

40
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:15,000
As I just said, before the land became an eyesore

41
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:22,400
The land used to be pristine before it was covered with these paper products and cans

42
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,800
And areas far out from villages looked good.

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,500
These days, you can tell every place a person has come to.

44
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:45,800
A person would come upon this place and throw things away, his old things and things he’s used.

45
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
These days, that’s what the land has become.

46
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,800
Even the wilderness is no longer pristine.

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don’t think they respect it anymore.

48
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,000
That’s all from me. [Okay.]

49
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
She says that…

50
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:16,700
Youpl respected plants, rivers, lakes, those things back then.

51
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,400 
Respectfully watched over them and respected them. [Yes, yes.]

52
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:34,000
Those things even here in this great Kuskokwim River, probably on the Yukon too

53
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:42,500
People are instructed to respectfully watch over this river.

54
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:55,000
Also, for us, in the spring or summer

55
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,400
We have instructions from our ancestors

56
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:12,000
In the summer, we should never throw old food from the last summer or year.

57
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:23,700
They said that if those year-old [foods] go there, the fish won’t go around it too often

58
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:34,700
Like that creek that she talked about, it won’t have a healthy amount of fish around there.

59
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,000
Instead, they said not to throw those year-old [foods] into that water.

60
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
They said we should bury them in pits so that they’re not noticeable.

61
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:59,900
But they said we could throw fresh fish along with their guts

61
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We should only dump them down where no one will tread, where no person will tread, somewhere deep where the tide does not go out too much.

62
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:25,000
They’ve started throwing them away these days until the shore has been covered in food because they don’t adhere to their instruction.

63
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:36,500
That is what respectfully watching over this great river when we subsist from it is supposed to be for us.

64
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Okay, as far as the river’s, in spring or summer, the rules of their forefathers were that they were told not to throw

65
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:01,500
If there should be leftovers that can’t be eaten from the winter, that you do not throw these into the river.

66
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,000
If you do, there’s a chance that the new fish will not come to that river.

67
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:21,000
In case what was just said may be understood because these people do not know, including this Fish and Game officer.

68
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,500
We cannot throw food away, and I have not heard of anyone throwing food away to this day.

69
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,000
Our Caucasian counterparts, however, throw food away.

70
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
That’s all.

71
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:50,000
He didn’t want any misunderstanding of throwing away.

72
00:09:50,500 --> 00:10:00,000
He’s saying that the native people as a whole are told that you don’t throw away food.

73
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,000
He just wanted to make that clear because he doesn’t say that they do that.

74
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:17,900
But he has seen, you know, people, you know, who don’t have that kind of rule

75
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,000
Throwing fish away just the way the are.

76
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You know, she asked if you respect something, even fish

77
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:43,400
You know, would youpl cut them a certain way out of respect?

78
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,000
Or, can that fish be cut in any way?

79
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:59,500
We had admonishments surrounding these fish back then, and they probably had them with marine animals down on the coast.

80
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,800
They told us not to cut fish with axes, but with knifes if they’re thawed.

81
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,400
They told us to only use those [knives] on everything.

82
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:23,000
They admonished us against using axes on those fish.

83
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,500
Only when they’re frozen and the dogs inland will eat them

84
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
They admonished us against using axes on that fish down by the water or inland.

85
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:44,000
That was an admonishment, not to cut fish out of the water with axes.

86
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:53,500
That’s what it’s like. They told us not to use axes inland or down by the water.

87
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,400
They didn’t like when axes were used on those.

88
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,500
They also said that they [inform others] and that no more fish go there

89
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:10,200
When our caretaker watched us taking bad care of those fish.

90
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,500
Yes, he has that answer.

91
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Elisa, what is “piqertuarluki?”

92
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,800
Axe.

93
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay, okay. There’s a way that you cut rather than hitting, hitting motion like an axe or what

94
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:37,000
Unless they’re frozen and can’t be cut any other way, then you show respect if it’s thawed.

95
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,000
Dried fish, we call dried fish neqerrluaraat.

96
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,500
When we have leftovers, we give them to those who have dogs.

97
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,000
We give them as gifts to those who have a lot of dogs.

98
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,400
And he also wanted to say that if they have leftover, like…

99
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,000
…different kinds of plants.

100
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:18,500
We also leave those berries that we don’t want picked, but even if there are a lot of berries, you know, that aren’t taken.

101
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But when they leave berries, they would get them with knapsacks if they walked inland.

102
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:41,500
If [s]he picks a lot, [s]he will leave them where they won’t be picked and then go get those berries.

103
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:50,500
Or if a person has help, [s]he will not leave [berries].

104
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,800
And even if there are a lot of berries in the wilderness, they said not to purposefully tread on them

105
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,500
These cloudberries, crowberries.

106
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Instead, they should keep from stepping on them.

107
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,800
Sometimes, though we try not to, we tread on them when there is too much.

108
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:31,500
And those plants that we eat, sourdock, sourdock, and wild rhubarb, and berries among trees

109
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:41,000
Youpl probably don’t know about some of them [like] high-bush cranberries, red currants, black currants

110
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,500
And those berries we pick among trees.

111
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,000
But some are admonished against.

112
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,500
You probably don’t know about baneberries that ravens eat

113
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,500
A plant with a lot of berries sticking on it that’s all red.

115
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,500
They call those baneberries.

116
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,500
If we eat them, we’ll get sick.

117
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:21,500
They also admonish us against eating those things muskrats eat in the wilderness. We call them poison water hemlocks.

118
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Those are deadly and poisonous.

119
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:35,500
We should also be wary and tell our children that they’re bad.

120
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:42,000
We should also tell our children about those edible plants.

121
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We also eat those wild celery.

122
00:15:49,500 --> 00:16:00,000
Our greens that they call spinich in English are gathered separately from the land

123
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,000
Including those fireweed.

124
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:15,900
And when these tree leaves are newly grown, eat them before they harden.

125
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Pull them with your hand and eat them, chew and eat them right away.

126
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,500
Those are good when they’re newly grown.

127
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,000
Those are the plants that we eat.

128
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:39,000
You probably know some of the plants. You probably know some.

129
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,000
I don’t know some of them.

130
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Those things they call waterlilies, what are they in Yup’ik again?

131
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,000
I didn’t understand what you said in English.

132
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,500
Those ones with big leaves floating in lakes and oxbow lakes?

133
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,900
Those? What do they call them again?

134
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Its name is obvious. (I do know it.)

135
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,000
Do you mean paparnat?

136
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,000
Yellow pond lilies.

137
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,800
I don’t know how useful those are.

138
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,900
I don’t know either.

139
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I talked about some of those plants I thought of.

140
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,400
Will you add to what he said?

141
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Let me add a little. (Okay.)

142
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:47,500
These plants are included in those paper and what to do with plants.

143
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:57,500
These things that were not excessively abundant were not easily gathered in our time.

144
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Some of what we gathered would be wasted if [we gathered] too much that would eventually be wasted.

145
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:19,000
Instead, they would have us gather according to what we needed so that we would not throw them away but finish them.

146
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,000
Because the people back then respected the wilderness

147
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,500
And they respected their gathering grounds as they said.

148
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:38,500
They didn’t have us gather too much exceeding what we needed.

149
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They told us not to gather more than we needed.

150
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,500
It was like they feared the wilderness even if it was just the wilderness.

151
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,000
And it was like they feared the places where things grew.

152
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:05,500
Our mothers wouldn’t let us gather a whole lot more than we needed.

153
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,500
They probably also did that.

154
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:26,400
However, when we gathered a lot of some of these plants that we would cook, the ones we would cook, sourdock or wild rhubarb

155
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:36,000
We only gathered a lot of those because we would store them after cooking them.

156
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:47,000
However, they told us not to gather more than we needed if we weren't going to use them.

157
00:19:50,800 --> 00:20:01,700
Okay, as for berries, he says much like what they had said…

158
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Because they’re only learning Western things in school, you know, they don’t know a lot.

159
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:23,000
So, Eliza is saying that, you know, there was just so very much that we can learn of our culture, the ways.

160
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:35,300
Even just the plants by themselves, if you look at that leaving everything else, they’re really just numerous

161
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:43,000
That we can learn and our children can learn, but they’re not learning because they’re not taught in schools.

162
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There is truly a lot that youpl don’t know, and things you don’t know including words.

163
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,000
There is so much that youpl don’t know.

164
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:02,500
And now, youpl have been talking about that. Some of it is still not talked about.

165
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,000
But now, we are helping her understand.

166
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,000
And what was said just now…

167
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,900
Thank you so much for coming.

168
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Thank you.

169
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Our companions.

170
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:27,000
I am going to end with those plants that we eat.

172
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,500
Voles also help us with different foods that we eat.

173
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:43,500
And you probably won’t say them by name because they have different names.

174
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:55,000
Voles also gather food that we eat in the fall filling up their caches full.

175
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,900
And we look for them under the ground.

176
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,500
Voles also gather those various things that we eat with different names.

177
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:18,700
And down on the coast, those voles also gather different things that we eat.

178
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,000
But we take their food from them because they’re good.

179
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,800
We use them for Yup’ik ice cream.

180
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That’s the last thing I’m [saying].
