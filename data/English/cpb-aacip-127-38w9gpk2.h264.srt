1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,050
Ready?

2
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:12,595
Who are you in English?

3
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:13,775
Helen.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,590
And in Yup’ik?

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,210
Narr’aq.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,910
And you’re from Napakiak? (Yes.)

7
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:22,545
And were you born here? (Yes.)

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,340
When were you born?

9
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:32,415
When was it again?

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,560
My baptism record is in there.

11
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:37,435
October?

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,950
October 1.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,020
I’m not sure when in the 1900’s. My baptism record is in there.

14
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:49,905
And you have four children?

15
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:52,715
Yes.

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,460
Yes, four.

17
00:00:57,255 --> 00:01:00,075
And you have eleven grandchildren?

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,370
And eleven great-grandchildren?

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:26,900
Back when you were growing up when they fished long ago before Western fishing rods appeared

20
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:34,995
What did they use instead of Western gill nets or those fishing rods?

21
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:46,895
Back then, I used to see non-Western fishing lines with hoods, and they had little nails fastened to the heads.

22
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:50,425
Some that spun would let the fish escape.

23
00:01:50,475 --> 00:02:01,905
Little pieces of ivory, and, you know, caribou antlers, I used to see tham used for fishing hooks.

24
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:11,795
And they would make fishing hoods out of spoons, some spoons, by shaving down their handles to use as fastening on the heads.

25
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,260
They made old-fashoined fish hooks out of those things that could sink.

26
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,260
Fishing lines and hooks came recently.

27
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:32,165
What did you see or hear about in your early childhood?

28
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:45,150
Well, I wasn’t born in time to see those who lived extremely hard lives back then.

29
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:55,635
And I observed a time with Caucasians like this. And I grew up here with Caucasians, with one among us whom we called Kass’all’er.

30
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,520
That was him. There were also Caucasians upriver.

31
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:04,955
But even though that’s the case

32
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:13,405
I want to talk about our traditional wisdom about how people should live well like this.

33
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:24,710
But bad things, when they didn’t hear about the Bible like this, or about religions

34
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:33,820
I recall now some of the traditional wisdom they passed down to me or that I heard.

35
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:39,615
But I can’t always speak about them, only to those who are willing.

36
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:48,135
And, you know, I tell especially you guys how you should live well.

37
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:56,980
Only a person who adheres to the traditional wisdom passed down to him like this lives a good life.

38
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:11,000
However, he who does not adhere to the traditional wisdom passed down to him lives a short life, or he who adheres to them lives a longer life.

39
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:22,105
They used to say this long ago: "A person who adheres to the traditional wisdom passed down to him lives to see another day.

40
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:29,585
"However, he who disobeys traditional wisdom only lives until the end of the day."

41
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:42,210
And young people these days, you young people have become different from what we used to see back then.

42
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:51,495
And even though I am bad like this, I knew and remembered the traditional wisdom passed down to me.

43
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,140
And these days, people have become very different.

44
00:04:56,595 --> 00:05:04,115
It seems there’s no more sensible people, or they’ve become unobservant of anything.

45
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,130
And it seems they are starting to live as blind people these days.

46
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:23,535
And the traditional wisdom, I do hear about traditional wisdom through KYUK here as well even though I don’t always listen in.

47
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:35,420
But it seems many do not hear them. It seems that young people especially do not hear about them.

48
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:49,540
And now, they don’t hear about how to live well or to treat their parents wells, living in obedience to their parents.

49
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,500
We only hear about wisdom in church.

50
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:02,370
That’s why we who have reached this age that must teach our grandchildren or our children

51
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:13,360
We must talk to them about these things we’ve heard or the traditional wisdom passed down to us.

52
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:24,080
You see, girls especially had traditional wisdom concerning them, and boys had separate wisdom concerning them.

53
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,870
A girl had this instruction

54
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:41,520
To keep boys who had not had women living carefully

55
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,380
Because it says this: "A woman leads to death."

56
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:57,750
I also used to fear this when I was young, people we feared it when we didn’t see many people dying

57
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,750
And I feared them when I saw death since a long time.

58
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,500
I feared it since I thought that would happen.

59
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:20,420
They told them to be careful with unmarried boys or unmarried girls.

60
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,800
They said that a girl would bring death upon a boy.

61
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,200
And some now are certainly like that.

62
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:41,930
These were the traditional wisdom passed down to us. They also especially told us not to bear illegitimate children.

63
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,110
That was very shameful to us.

64
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,830
And these days, it’s become irrelevant and without shame.

65
00:07:51,950 --> 00:08:03,190
It’s also because it says this in the Bible: "Nothing will become shameful anymore." The world has changed like this now.

66
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,420
That’s why we must be careful.

67
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:13,080
They escpecially told boys to be careful with themselves.

68
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:24,170
Before he had a woman, they told him not to be around girls. They told them not to be with girls like that.

69
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:31,060
They said that she would lead a boy to death even if she doesn’t actively murder him.

70
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:39,430
But even a very long time ago, a boy would not be perfect.

71
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:44,110
They called it "pretending to have wives," and girls "pretending to have husbands."

72
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,440
We don’t see anyone doing that these days.

73
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,990
But I used to hear about them back then.

74
00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:03,790
That’s why the people who lived back then especially admonished their people like this.

75
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:14,210
I also used to hear this: "Some people look at having children is all fun."

76
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,830
I also remember that with this people.

77
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,830
And because we don’t have anywhere else to go like this when we go to church

78
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:38,200
When they leave their children behind and they are alone like this, I remember that old piece of traditional wisdom.

79
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:49,420
They say that some people act like having children is all fun without teaching them, and do not say anything even when they do dangerous things.

80
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,850
But we must talk to them.

81
00:09:53,090 --> 00:10:05,790
I also speak to those whom I must teach about what I know, even if some of them don’t seem to want to listen, or to other children.

82
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,820
These are the things that are only to help people live well.

83
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:24,380
Even though we hear gossip like this, I also hear some too, but we must talk about the traditional wisdom that helps people live good lives

84
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,070
To the people of our descendants.

85
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:36,260
They probably remember how to live good lives as they go.

86
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,040
And now, it truly seems that the traditional wisdom has moved.

87
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:48,820
It’s said that obedient people will someday live in paradise.

88
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,710
These are desirable.

89
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,440
Even though it’s not a lot, I’ve said this.

90
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,840
Okay, is that all?

91
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,690
Yes, I’ve spoken about this.

92
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,400
Can you speak on one more thing? (Yes.)

93
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,020
Now, you know, my superior told me about what we hear about today

94
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:26,450
About how children are hurt by adults, or, you know, some are beaten, molested, or other things by adults.

95
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:36,410
Back when you were young, did you see children being molested or hurt?

96
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,820
I never saw those, or those who were molested.

97
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:56,420
Back when I was young, it seems that I never heard about those who were molested or beaten.

98
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:01,670
People back then were not like now.

99
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,580
I also used to see some with sod houses like this.

100
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,030
And in their houses, they didn’t have a lot of things, almost nothing

101
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,440
Except for bedding like this, what little they had.

102
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:32,300
I don’t think I heard of anything, especially about children abused like that, even though people lived hard lives.

103
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,910
But I didn’t hear about them mistreating them, doing bad things to them, or beating them.

104
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:52,510
It’s that only recently, only very recently to me, I’ve started hearing about those who are molested and beaten.

105
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:06,200
Children are no longer how they were like long ago, long ago compared to today.

106
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:14,390
Yes, you know, I’ve just said that people these days have changed.

107
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:22,760
The children these days have also changed.

108
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:29,650
I never used to see children like this back then.

109
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:40,580
That’s why a child will not live like these because we are Yup’ik, and even if they are trying to live a Western life.

110
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:47,120
That’s why they should speak to their children only in Yup’ik.

111
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,520
A long time ago, because we, at least I, didn’t know Western things and since I don’t know English

112
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:03,510
All of us here, and probably those up north, would only speak to their children in Yup’ik.

113
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,750
That’s why I remember that these days.

114
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:23,260
That’s why a child who learn only in English cannot understand traditional wisdom and admonishments anymore these days.

115
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,920
That’s why people, including children, have changed especially today.

116
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,030
Yes, that’s enough now.

117
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,520
Is that all? Oh, yes.

118
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,180
They also asked me to [?] like this

119
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:57,230
You know, your life back then, I mean...

120
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:09,050
You know, they asked for funny stories from when you first saw planes or those kinds of things...

121
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:18,940
We used to be amazed by them, yes, when there weren’t many planes, but there were planes upriver.

122
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:27,600
Back then at that time, Taqay’aq was the most prominent pilot over in Nanglleq.

123
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:38,110
When that plane approached, I’m not sure how big we were, and this village, you know, wasn’t heavily populated; there were few of us.

124
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:51,030
And then, it was probably we children, every single one of us would go down here to the bluff and have fun watching that plane.

125
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:55,100
Even these adults would be amazed.

126
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:01,140
They also used to be amazed wondering how planes flew.

127
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,690
They had a lot of, you know, fun, including us.

128
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,440
Taqay’aq was the main one who came here.

129
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,620
I think that was the first time that I saw that plane at the time.

130
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:26,610
Okay, now if you don’t have anything else to add...

131
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,140
About what? (Giants.)

132
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,490
I don’t know about those giants.

133
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,720
But I also heard about them. I’ve forgotten about them now.

134
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,890
I also...

135
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:51,170
But in my mind, I think these pieces of traditional wisdom about how people should live well are important.

136
00:16:51,480 --> 00:17:01,360
And everything, you know, required hard work like this.

137
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:13,720
But our short lives seem to require hard work. It seems that it requires hard work to those who try to do good.

138
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:25,390
But the reward, the reward for a person who does good is great, how a person should live well.

139
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:35,700
These days, as you just asked, even adults seem to have changed.

140
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:44,670
Their mischievous ways have especially caused them to change

141
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,680
These mischievous ways.

142
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:56,860
Those who go after them do not live well.

143
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,050
It seems that they are born envying those around them these days.

144
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,670
It seems his mischievous ways deprive him of that.

145
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,410
He is not like those who do well.

146
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,810
That’s why he should not do those things.

147
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:33,280
If a person learns what is admonished against or what brings misfortune and does not do them, he will help himself.

148
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,300
Okay, that’s it. Thank you.
