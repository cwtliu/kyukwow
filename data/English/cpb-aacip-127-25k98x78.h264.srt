1
00:00:01,547 --> 00:00:04,756
I just have the one that I just loaded.

2
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:08,663
Okay, I'm rolling.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:15,090
Back when you were a teenager and you traveled

4
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:19,729
to other villages or when you went hunting,

5
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:25,190
did you ever see anything very strange

6
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:32,029
or did you ever hear of anything strange or scary?

7
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:40,065
Yes, I did back when I had taken a wife.

8
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:44,006
I didn't experience that when I was teenager.

9
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:51,383
My late older brother and my older sister inland, my full sister. taught me.

10
00:00:51,925 --> 00:01:00,165
When I began to travel to learn, my father would take me with them every time, take me even if I wouldn't be helpful.

11
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:08,297
They really taught me well. They taught me well out of great love.

12
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:24,943
And that is how I lived growing up. Eventually when I grew older, my brother an I [traveled] by ourselves because we were the only men since many would die.

13
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:35,877
My brother would take me with him and I started going every time he traveled. I wasn’t helpful with anything.

14
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:43,818
But I worked for him and started cooking and starting the fire to cook. That’s how I grew up.

15
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:49,399
And when I became competent, I was born. (??)

16
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:56,799
I would then think this, would say this, "I won't get wife."

17
00:01:57,537 --> 00:02:04,114
It turned out, you see, that my relatives here would say to me that I would get a wife.

18
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:09,573
I would say that I wouldn’t get a wife. I didn’t care about women.

19
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:16,170
It turned out that taking a wife makes one entrenched in having a wife.

20
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,693
When I had taken a wife, I would go to the wilderness more because I started regularly traveling.

21
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:30,866
It turned out I was fated to do this.

22
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:38,313
And then when I lay down here on the ground

23
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:44,690
I wouold fall asleep, also when I lay among the grass.

24
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:48,252
I pitched a tent over me.

25
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:53,418
Oh my, I sang a song that I started hearing, <i>ii-yii ii-yaa</i>

26
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,212
It turned out that I was supposed to sing.

27
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:10,130
Then when I would hunt seals in the spring, in the lakes, you know the [?kevneret], when we hunt muskrats in the spring.

28
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:17,440
While I was spring seal hunting, it called out to me like this, <i>"Apaqutaq!"</i> 

29
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,590
I was started and loaded my gun thinking that I was going to see something.

30
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:29,726
That’s how I did it. I’ve gone through that twice.

31
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:33,461
Twice something called out to me.

32
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:40,888
It turned out that obeying those that taught me

33
00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:49,078
It’s very good. And now, I have not destroyed a person’s mindset.

34
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:51,303
According to my admonishment.

35
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:57,651
For a person’s mindset, they told me not to speak harshly to him.

36
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:00,418
That is how people are.

37
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:02,644
That is how the people back then were.

38
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:06,405
They have a custom like that.

39
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:14,266
They lived in accordance and treating each other with love. They treated each other with love.

40
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:21,920
My iluraq, cousin, down there from Tununak and I

41
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:29,879
[?We were always together as boys]. I wonder who’s older? I think I’m older.

42
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:37,761
We grew up always with each other, and started going hunting with each other.

43
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:39,801
Yes.

44
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:50,595
Then the first time, the very first time you saw a Caucasian, a real Caucasian

45
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:53,736
What did you think?

46
00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:00,063
I was scared of the real Caucasian in Kayalivik

47
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:05,374
They were scarcly any Caucasians here in Alaska.

48
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:14,797
The Caucasians coming to Kayalivik, the would arrive in the winter once in a while.

49
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:20,929
They would give the people fitting names, and give them fitting names from their parkas.

50
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:24,647
They’d also give them fitting names by their heads/hair.

51
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:28,446
People named Qiivcugpak [Curly], Nayilek [One with Sealskin]

52
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:35,624
They even called Neqiacaagalek by that name. They used to call Waskie, Neqiacak.

53
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:39,711
That person, Itertaalleq [One who Brought in a Lot]

54
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:49,672
When there was an epidemic back then, he traveled by sled, and he even traveled by sled in the summer. He was a soldier then.

55
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,780
And this, you know

56
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:59,538
You know that school over there?

57
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:08,526
The owner, yes, I see the picture of the one I used to hear about. I used to see it when I was a teacher over there.

58
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:12,715
Kilbuk School.

59
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,358
That Kilbuk [School] is of the [Bureau of] Indian [Affairs].

60
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:19,925
This is how he first went to war.

61
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:25,622
Among those who recorded over in Kilbuck School.

62
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:29,290
His picture over there.

63
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:41,305
Then back when you first saw a Caucasian, what did you think?

64
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:43,556
And you saw a Caucasian for the first time.

65
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:48,964
That Caucasian, it turned out that these Caucasians were like this.

66
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:56,350
I saw one. Also, when Caucasians came after that, that Caucasian

67
00:06:56,952 --> 00:07:07,749
He slept at Kayalivik. They only [slept] in community houses. And Caucasians arrivered there to the community house where they only slept in the community house.

68
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,726
Their things

69
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:15,756
They would eat their provisions of [caribou skin].

70
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:23,390
Caucasians would catch them. They would also bring in grass for matting.

71
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:30,729
They would spread out grass for matting, and he would spread some out in his sleeping area.

72
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:34,760
The people back then used to do that.

73
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:42,059
The men wouldn’t be afrais, and when Caucasians came on sleds, a sled like this

74
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:50,890
They had various things, tobacco, tea. [I used to see] teapots, [and tea. They would use pitchers like this.]

75
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,744
They would trade a mink skin like this.

76
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,326
Two pitchers [of tea].

77
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:02,791
They would raise that white one.

78
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:06,943
And the other here, the other like this.

79
00:08:07,683 --> 00:08:10,394
That was how much it was worth.

80
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,845
They would trade that mink skin like that.

81
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:17,927
They say this now: "Caucasians back then

82
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:25,400
"They used to pay a lot of money to people here from Alaska."

83
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:30,304
They took his money, would have their money

84
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:32,782
When they bring them out of states.

85
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:38,861
They would be committed to doing that.

86
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:47,938
I have a great many stories to tell. And Alaska here

87
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:52,263
Now, I have gone everywhere in Alaska.

88
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:57,510
Now, I work in Alaska by traveling.

89
00:08:57,956 --> 00:09:08,001
Then to you, why don’t you want young people to forget their way of life?

90
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:13,094
It’s because of this

91
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:15,805
Because of our land

92
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:17,450
Our land here.

93
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,689
If they forget it,

94
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:28,536
Even if he wants to be Western, he cannot be without money.

95
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:33,299
However, if he is traditionally Yup’ik even without money

96
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:36,425
Neither will he be hungry.

97
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:43,344
Yet if he has no money, he can’t do anything and can’t eat.

98
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:51,237
We don’t want them to forget that because it is a promise. Because it’s a Yup’ik way of life.

99
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:54,675
Like that.

100
00:09:55,975 --> 00:10:00,302
Is the tape still recording what I’ve been saying?

101
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:02,683
Okay.

102
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:11,226
So, when they used to have dancing festivals long ago, what were they like?

103
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:20,503
The people back then would have dance festivals by sending what they called an invitor to that village

104
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:29,326
To their competing [village]. Then when it’s time, they would get them, two boys with a sled like this.

105
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:36,974
Then when they arrived, they danced. Those guests would bring various things to give during dances.

106
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:42,055
Since I grew up just when Caucasians first came

107
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:51,280
During dances, they would give out cloth, and a lot of animal skins, seal skins.

108
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,749
They also gave caribout hides during dances.

109
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:00,650
Whatever that host village wanted

110
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,025
We’re a [host settlement here in Bethel.

111
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:07,204
That’s what they did.

112
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:14,104
They would ask those people like that to give those things.

113
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:20,738
Then they would give through dancing. The guests would dance and give what was requested.

114
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:34,028
They would dance and give various things that they had said, guns, dancing and giving various things, smokehole covers, pots.

115
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:39,013
It was fun. It was fun.

116
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:43,993
Then when they were done, the host village would dance.

117
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:45,926
They did the same when they danced.

118
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:50,471
Then when they were done, they had what they called a feast.

119
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:59,297
The guests would bring in [food], at least since I grew up down in Kayalivik.

120
00:11:59,924 --> 00:12:07,494
They would bring in seal oil, various cooked food, walrus, beluga.

121
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:12,567
Various things, including cooked fish.

122
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:18,759
They would let the guests go back home with absolutely nothing in need.

123
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,677
People used to do that.

124
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,900
They helped each other a lot.

125
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,562
They helped each other a lot.

126
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:30,584
You know, it was like trading like this

127
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:34,653
They would trade their things.

128
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,094
They helped each other like this.

129
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:44,339
You see, I have a lot of stories to tell about everything.

130
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:54,696
But what are masks? Why do some wear masks today when they dance?

131
00:12:55,195 --> 00:13:01,054
They used to make masks, those magic things.

132
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:07,139
They said they were depictions of things, depictions of seals or fish.

133
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:12,806
You know, they have various things around them, even it’garuat [certain plants].

134
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:14,858
That’s how they made them.

135
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:25,240
Then when they fishing wearind them in dancing, the people from here would hold Itruka’ar [Inviting Feast]. They also called it Keggnaqurluteng [Wearing Masks] down [on the coast].

136
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:28,907
They called it Kegginaqurluteng [Wearing Masks] down there.

137
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,320
And here they [called] it It’ruka’ar.

138
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:36,880
Then when they were finished, they discarded them.

139
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:42,125
And they would, you know, give those masks to the children they loved.

140
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:47,774
Like that. People back then had strange customs.

141
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:54,837
From what I’ve seen of these young people

142
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:59,177
They’ve become lazy and sedentary.

143
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:03,720
The youth I saw were active.

144
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,488
They also had strength competitions.

145
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:18,387
They held strength competitions outside. They held strength competitions to tease each other. That’s what people did back then.

146
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:20,977
They always competed.

147
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:27,951
They would run too, even by themselves, and with their peers, what friends they had.

148
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:36,738
Then they would compete by twisting [something]. They had [?speed] competitions. The young people did various things.

149
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:44,668
And they wouldn’t let them sleep in the morning. Every one I see wouldn’t sleept for long in the community house back then.

150
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:49,488
They were very active. When they were told to do something, they would obey.

151
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:53,208
Then if a person, old man, or man, asked for something to be done

152
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:57,741
He would run out trying to go before his peers.

153
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:02,013
You see, the ones I saw were very active.

154
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:11,966
What about those Yup’ik songs?

155
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:20,148
Now, you work with Yup’ik songs and you drum.

156
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:22,938
Where did you learn them from?

157
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:27,452
It’s because I grew up with those who always danced.

158
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:33,493
Since I grew up [like that], I also apparently started singing when I was small.

159
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,422
So,

160
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:41,613
I can write a song if I want to write a song and sing.

161
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:44,220
Then, those old songs too.

162
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:51,234
These days, I try to sing a lot as I am doing now.

163
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:53,736
The baby inland

164
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:56,664
He’s, you know

165
00:15:57,076 --> 00:16:00,880
You know, the old [songs] he’s heard, since he’s not fluent

166
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,008
The ones I saw would get tired of hearing songs that are always sung every year.

167
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,120
They would always replace their songs with new ones.

168
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:16,807
They would try to write songs every year. That’s what people used to do.

169
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:20,513
They keep singing only new songs.

170
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:25,353
They would always have new songs for the year.

171
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:31,587
Please sing us a short song.

172
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:35,457
They said that long ago

173
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:42,220
My late father would tell me, "The people of Kayalivik had two community houses, two gargantuan community houses."

174
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:47,540
He said one was called [?Qukutnguq], and the other was Qasgirpak.

175
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:51,547
And the other was dug out like a mudhouse.

176
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:58,288
The two ends submerged toward the water, here inland from Kayalivigmiut

177
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:01,438
Touching the edge of the village.

178
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:04,473
The hole was like this.

179
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,791
The two ends were submerged, and the middle here was visible.

180
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:16,361
The one further inland, however, became infested with grass like this with nothing [left].

181
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,494
They said it was back when there was a lot of people in Kayalivik.

182
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:27,157
My father always told us stories back when we were young.

183
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,528
Now for Qasgirpagmiut?

184
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:42,108
Noy, you see, I know the songs from a long time ago [and can sing] some of them anytime, a few of them.

185
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:48,396
"Angaa-yii-yaa agiyaa-ii-yaa." Then their dance movements.

186
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:50,885


187
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:56,488
Look how the real dance movements are like this [?upriver].

188
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:32,259
Mengyaq here is going to go, he’s going to go [dance] in Qasgirpagmiut

189
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:38,936
Are the people of Qasgirpak curling their tails yii-ya-ya,

190
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:59,405
You see, when he would sing for people, he started talking about it when he had grandchildren.

191
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:05,858
He said that the people of Kayalivik back then

192
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:13,470
Those two community houses would compete with each other in the Kevgiq [Messengar Feast], dancing like this.

193
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:18,417
The people down in Kayalivik apparently loved to dance.

194
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:22,506
Yes, that’s what it’s like.

195
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:30,878
We also used to accompany that with dancing before the host village.

196
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:38,534
When they would dance for the host village, they would dance with arm movements like this.

197
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:29,214
How does the verse go again?

198
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:38,033
Oh, I sang their song, you know, that they sung for a certain purpose.

199
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,878
I made a mistake.

200
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:47,352
I forgot it. You see, I know some of their songs that I heard very well.

201
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,985
I see.

202
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:48,295
I see.
I can talk about anything from long ago.

203
00:20:48,295 --> 00:20:51,129
I can talk about anything from long ago.

204
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:51,865
I see.

205
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:53,203
Okay.

206
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:54,905
The [recoding] is full now.

207
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,078
I see.

208
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:57,280
Thank you very much.

209
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,897
Thank you very much.
Yes.

210
00:20:57,897 --> 00:20:58,288
Yes.

211
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:03,329
We’ll use them. I’ll notify you when we’re going to use them.

212
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,018
We’ll use them. I’ll notify you when we’re going to use them.
Yes, okay, okay.

213
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:04,369
Yes, okay, okay.

214
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,713
Okay. Oh my.
Yes, okay, okay.

215
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:06,726
Yes, okay, okay.

216
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:13,126
Their Ilurapak [Big Cousin], your Ilurapak out there, Louie, is your Ilurapak.

217
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:19,768
He’s from Cuukvagtuli. The man out there and I are from Kayalivigmiut.

218
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:20,856
I see.
He’s from Cuukvagtuli. The man out there and I are from Kayalivigmiut.

219
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:21,053
I see.

220
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:22,397
Yes.
