1
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:23,790
I advised them this, the elders, my peers:

2
00:00:23,795 --> 00:00:32,875
This way, these school age children our children who are called the young people who are just starting,

3
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,500
Not to discourage them.

4
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,910
Don’t tell them that they are crazy, also don’t call them names, names that aren’t theirs.

5
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:56,700
If we do that, us elders will be creating enemies for ourselves.

6
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:06,260
They will be against us elders if we repeatedly hurt them.

7
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:14,400
But to tell them our way of life, our struggles in years past.

8
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:20,580
Hoping these things will be helpful to them.

9
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:30,230
Because while we are still alive as I have been watching, things have changed.

10
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,400
Everything is changing.

11
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,030
It’s not the the same as before. Even these people are changing.

12
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:44,460
Even our children are changing.

13
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:50,822
They now go to school.

14
00:01:50,822 --> 00:02:02,563
They now go to highschool and to college. Back then we never saw these things.

15
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:06,052
These never happened.

16
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:14,865
We should not oppose the Kass’aq people so much even though they are doing these to us.

17
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:19,656
They are trying to help us through our children.

18
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:28,491
But sometimes we do not understand and view it as oppression.

19
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:32,520
We say that they are “breaking” our children,  these other people.

20
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:41,878
They need to learn. Through the education they have received, our children, our young people

21
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,944
Are helping us elders of today. We cannot do these things.

22
00:02:48,950 --> 00:03:00,661
Even here with this Elders Conference, these young people obtained money for our travel

23
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:06,510
They let us see each other, we who have no other way to get together

24
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:12,912
Our children are able to do this.

25
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:19,587
My own children don’t always follow advice.

26
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:24,090
