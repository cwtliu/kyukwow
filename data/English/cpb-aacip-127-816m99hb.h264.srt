1
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,970
When I was young, I grew up in the community house.

2
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:25,525
Then, you know, I would always sleep by my father in the community house

3
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,620
Among many people like this, you know, the community house, you know it.

4
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:36,370
Cuukvagtulirmiut also had a community house, our competitors.

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,440
By my father.

6
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:48,365
Then above there, the community houses had sleeping areas, bedding, two feet

7
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,665
Two feet of wood.

8
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,570
Then when it was time, I’d go down to the nateq, the floor

9
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:01,815
The floor planks, you know, to the floor.

10
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:05,225
I would sleep, and we wouldn’t mind.

11
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:14,275
These kinds of small gloves, or, we would use those traditional Yup’ik gloves as headrests and sleep.

12
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:19,765
Right, it was nothing to us a long time ago, you know?

13
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,665
That’s how we lived.

14
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:31,585
My grandfather raised me.

15
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:33,140
He didn’t raise me.

16
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,170
He wouldn’t let me sleep in the morning like this.

17
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:43,210
Apparently, he did that so that I would live well.

18
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:49,435
And when I slept like this, he would come wake me up [shaking] these.

19
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:59,180
Then when my grandfather said from the floor, "Quickly go outside"

20
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,720
He said I’d feel better outside.

21
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:07,800
When I went out, I’d feel better, awake, and no longer sleepy at all.

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:14,860
And to this day, I never sleep in the morning [?].

23
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:18,025
I should say some things in English.

24
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,490
These days, I don’t hear anyone instructing anymore.

25
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:58,705
Since it’s gone out like a light in us who’ve become elders, it’s like our traditional wisdom is sleeping.

26
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:09,255
In our traditional wisdom, they would especially tell us to revere our land and the water.

27
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,910
Revere it.

28
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:21,155
In other words, this is what our instructors were like:

29
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,940
[Revere nature] as much as our own bowls.

30
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,720
These days, it’s not like that. It’s become different.

31
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,675
What does that mean, "as much as our own bowls?"

32
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:37,265
This is how I understand it:

33
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:48,510
Our bowls when we eat, at least, since a person had one bowl in the past back then, (s)he watched their bowl carefully.

34
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,830
They treated it with love, reverence.

35
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:57,285
I think that is a metaphor

36
00:03:57,955 --> 00:04:03,595
That we should revere our land and water as much as our own bowls.

37
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,840
This is part of the traditional wisdom of the people long ago.

38
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:16,565
They also used to say

39
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:30,390
They said that a boy should not be with a girl before he takes a women [as a wife].

40
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,730
We are destroying ourselves these days.

41
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,530
We are destroying our lives, and we are destroying our bodies.

42
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:46,165
And with this, I also used to heavily abuse alcohol.

43
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:51,355
That is what destroys our bodies.

44
00:04:51,755 --> 00:05:01,545
Also, when a person does something bad, it is known all across the land

45
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:04,925
Especially back then.

46
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,620
Since they weren’t so terribly mischievous back then

47
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:14,735
The occassional one who [misbehaved] would be conspicuous.

48
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:21,495
These days, though they [misbehave] every day, we’ve become different

49
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:25,030
Because we elders don’t say anything anymore.

50
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:34,680
Back then, they would instruct them, even if it wasn’t a lot, not taking things lightly.

51
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:09,880
To anyone listening, I am speaking of things that are not unbelievable, that are true.

52
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:21,410
To my cousins out there, my name is Kunuin from Qinaq, who has moved as Tuntutuliar.

53
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,760
I moved to Tuntutuliar in 1945.

54
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:32,330
Today, I am thankful that KYUK invited me.

55
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:40,360
I’m not completely well. I am going to sing a song of gratitude so that my problem may pass.

56
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,320
Let us desire to walk well together in the light of the sun.

57
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:52,510
We’re thankful tagi-yara-ya

58
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,920
We’re bowing yagi-yara-ya

59
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,000
Ii-rri-rri-yarrai

60
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:07,460
What a cause for gratitude agya-rrai

61
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:13,010
We’re thankful tagi-yara-ya

62
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,230
We’re bowing tagi-yara-ya

63
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:23,210
Ii-rri-rri-yarrai

64
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,440
What a cause for gratitude agya-rrai uu!

65
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,530
There you have it.

66
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,430
How was that?

67
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:02,585
My earliest memories are in Qinarmiut.

68
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:13,070
In my earliest memories growing up, there was nothing [Wester] in Qinaq, and there was no Bible.

69
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:17,105
There were no Christians.

70
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:26,400
My earliest memories are when my next younger sibling died.

71
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,160
I’ve had consistent long-term memories since then.

72
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:33,095
I got to know the people in Qinaq.

73
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:40,545
I’ve had consistent memories since then, observing the people. I was from Qinaq.

74
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:49,490
Then, you see, when I became capable

75
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:59,790
There were scarcely any Caucasians, but they had one resident Caucasian whom they called Klondoke Johnson, whom they called Paru in Yup’ik.

76
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:04,285
His four children were our fellow boys.

77
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,870
Two are still alive, no, three.

78
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:15,870
But I was scared of Paru. We were scared of Caucasians; they were strange people to us.

79
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,070
When we saw them, "Oh my, I won’t walk around." They were scary.

80
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:26,595
The people of Qinaq lived there, and they didn’t have a school.

81
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:35,000
And when I grew up and went in the community house, when I was at the community house

82
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:48,220
I was scared of Akagtaq, the grandfather of the one whom I’d apparently marry, the one whom I’d apparently marry downriver.

83
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,120
When he was in there, since my grandmother was his friend

84
00:09:55,285 --> 00:10:05,940
Since my grandmother [?joked about] him, I was scared of him thinking that he really used to eat people.

85
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,050
Apparently, it was because I was her grandchild.

86
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:16,530
I really believed her, and she said he had ears in the soil.

87
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:24,740
When she was at their house over there, she said she’d hear what was going on over there [in the community house].

88
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:33,060
That’s why when I remember her, just real quickly, I say today

89
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:42,520
"I wish I could have that one that said she had ears in the soil make a phone call far away under the mountains."

90
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,895
That’s what they were like.

91
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:17,785
When I started being at the community house

92
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,390
The people, back before I started going to the community house, you see

93
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:39,424
People like this, when their little sons or daughters [first] caught something in their lives

94
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:44,749
When their little boys made their first catches with arrows

95
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:54,212
They would remove the flesh from that little bird, hang it to dry threaded through a branch, prop and hang it to dry.

96
00:11:54,219 --> 00:12:00,306
Then the next winter, they’d have a feast for him.

97
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,381
They would do that every year.

98
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:09,019
Then me, in our old fish camp inland, downriver

99
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:15,838
Downriver from Tagyaraq, when we wandered inland as I had started running

100
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,950
You see, this ptarmigan that had taken off fell.

101
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:24,532
As I chased it, it would take off, then fall.

102
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:28,063
Eventually, I tripped and took it.

103
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:33,032
Though it tried to fly away, I didn’t let it and killed it.

104
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,626
I didn’t know what became of it.

105
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:46,226
Apparently, my grandmother hung it to try on a tree like that.

106
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:49,714
I didn’t know and never saw it.

107
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:57,945
Our winter camp Iingirayuq downriver

108
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:08,752
Three families like this would set big fish traps.

109
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:16,577
They would fish for whitefish, broad whitefish, whitefish with pointed heads.

110
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:25,189
And my father’s fish trapping spot under the land down there would have a lot of fish.

111
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:39,183
The next winter, you see, Qinarmiut sent invitations to Eek and Apruka’ar

112
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:42,514
Since they did that when Apruka’ar was populated.

113
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,583
The guests arrived.

114
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:54,854
You see, they would make Yup’ik ice cream in huge bowls

115
00:13:55,942 --> 00:14:09,905
Traditional ice cream with tallow, rendering fat from seal blubber with heat, cutting them up back when they’d make Yup’ik ice cream.

116
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:17,292
Then, you see, they told me to go to the community house, that I should go with them.

117
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:26,948
I went out to find my father’s sled filled end to end with food.

118
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:30,786
This huge serving bowl had Yup’ik ice cream.

119
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:38,392
You see, the ptarmigan I’d caught last summer had props [on the wings] and was staked into the ice cream.

120
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:43,249
Apparently, my father held a feast for me.

121
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:49,262
I didn’t go to the community house. I was distressed, scared of that cannibal.

122
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:56,081
I didn’t go with him because the one whom I was afraid of was alive back then.

123
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:58,819
That’s what they used to do.

124
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,825
We started sleeping in the community house.

125
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:33,919
That big community house, I’m not sure how big it was.

126
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:43,919
Then the young people and our elders lay down for bed, there’d be no room.

127
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:57,319
When going in late, sometimes when I had no bedding, I would lay on my below the front of the door and sleep.

128
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,207
Like that.

129
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:09,638
Some mornings, however, I would wake up to someone instructing up there.

130
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:20,894
One of the old men woudl already be speaking about instructions, traditional wisdom, how a person should live

131
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:30,269
How a boy shoudl live, what is in store for the future, what is true.

132
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:40,257
When we got up, we wouldn’t make sudden movements getting up, and listen to that one giving instruction.

133
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:42,913
They wouldn’t force us awake.

134
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,120
That happened every morning.

135
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:54,452
Then during the day like this, when their fire bath died down because they’d have blazing fire baths

136
00:16:54,471 --> 00:17:03,058
They would give instruction about life, the encroaching future

137
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:10,633
When a boy is [married to] a woman, oh my, and it was a long way off for us.

138
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:14,646
Apparently, they gave us a guide so we wouldn’t be lost.

139
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:46,240
They tell stories about how before that

140
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:55,659
Before we were born, when those old men were boys, they would strongly practice traditional instruction.

141
00:17:55,666 --> 00:18:02,466
They said that when they were going to give instruction in the community house

142
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:06,610
They would [block] the door with a piece of split spruce.

143
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:08,966
Do you know what cigyak is?

144
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:12,235
You know the wood to make fish traps?

145
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:15,648
Where is it? Wasn’t there one here?

146
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:20,655
Fish traps, they have split spruce that are this wide.

147
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:25,837
They put it on its side crosswise [from the door].

148
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:28,762
And only then would they speak of traditional wisdom.

149
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:40,274
Then they said that because people are different like this, because boys are different

150
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:50,368
They said that one of the boys would go out of the community house, even breaking that [split spruce].

151
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:57,081
They’d start speaking about him, "Oh my, the traditional wisdom doesn’t call him."

152
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:05,962
They said that a person who acts improperly does that.

153
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:44,913
Then the women separately out there in the houses, the [?elderly/knowledgeable] old women would would instruct them

154
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:52,438
When a girl takes a husband, how she should take care of her husband.

155
00:19:52,450 --> 00:20:07,475
I caught them [instructing] there in the winter camp, and the door was blocked off with grass, woven grass belts to keep out the draft.

156
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:13,306
Then they said that one of the girls as well

157
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:19,757
I observed that in one house, three families would mosty live in the same house.

158
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:25,195
It would also be occupied by four families.

159
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:29,164
They said that one of the girls would go out.

160
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:31,926
Then they’d speak of her.

161
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:47,508
They said that one of them would even take of the grass belt block, the grass that was tacked there.

162
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:55,683
They said when she did that for the third time, that old woman would give her her fate

163
00:20:56,283 --> 00:21:03,583
"Let her do that, so she’ll be the person of the threshhold."

164
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,777
Do you know what a caniqaq is?

165
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,352
Where is it?

166
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:16,015
The threshhold of the door out there is a caniqaq. They call it a caniqaq.

167
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:21,934
And the back wall of the house way in there, in front of the door is the egkuq.

168
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:28,066
This is the threshhold like that when they had sod houses.

169
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:30,972
"She will be the person of the threshhold."

170
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:40,910
Oh my, they explained that people who subsist use the threshhold. "She will be the person of the floor."

171
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:45,416
Apparently, she pointed out her exact future.

172
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:55,848
She loses her mother and father, stays here, stays here, because she doesn’t heed traditional wisdom.

173
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,773
Then the one who would run out from the community house out there

174
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:08,210
They said when he does it for a third time, an old man gives him his fate

175
00:22:08,216 --> 00:22:16,466
"Let him do that, so he will show his nice teeth at the end of a snowbank."

176
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:18,585
Do you understand it?

177
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:21,117
This is what it means:

178
00:22:21,136 --> 00:22:27,436
Every [?], when they predicted famines from bad weather

179
00:22:27,443 --> 00:22:33,118
They said he starves to death here, do you know what a qengaruk is?

180
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:34,874
Snow[bank].

181
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:41,124
Over at the end, his teeth are very white.

182
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:47,487
They say the poor guy starves to death. They say he shows his nice teeth.

183
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:52,756
Tha’ts what they were like.

184
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:19,107
They put skins on two drums.

185
00:23:19,282 --> 00:23:26,295
Then when it was getting dark, they’d beat the two drums.

186
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:37,570
My father, and the father of the old lady downriver would sing opposite each other, but I didn’t learn their songs.

187
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,345
I never learned them when I had too much fun.

188
00:23:41,357 --> 00:23:45,357
I have some incomplete knowledge of some songs.

189
00:23:45,364 --> 00:23:51,914
When this is over, I’ll sing one I know in Yup’ik.

190
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:54,746
They would sing loudly.

191
00:23:55,246 --> 00:24:06,683
Then eventually, a woman would go into the community house holding a ceremonial nerukar bowl [of food].

192
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:16,971
After she put it down on the floor plank, she would dance what they called an Ingulaq dance. And she went out when she was done.

193
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:23,077
Then before long, a woman would come in with a bowl

194
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:32,684
Eventually down there, the floor planks would be [?slanted] like this, the fireplace in the big community house.

195
00:24:32,697 --> 00:24:39,234
And the floor planks like this would be filled with small nerukar bowls.

196
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:43,409
And when they stopped coming in, they put the drums away.

197
00:24:43,422 --> 00:24:50,547
The people of the community house would eat what was absolutely not Western food

198
00:24:50,553 --> 00:25:02,291
Little fermented fish heads, aged salmon egg ice cream, moss with aged seal oil, whitefish egg ice cream, dried fish.

199
00:25:02,304 --> 00:25:09,066
We little boys would say, "Moss with aged seal oil is good," what they call puyat [plural].

200
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:16,892
Moss with aged seal oil, people always had puyat.

201
00:25:16,905 --> 00:25:24,405
The moss, soak the moss in seal oil, the moss from the land.

202
00:25:24,424 --> 00:25:26,874
They say Urucararmiut [People of Moss] here.

203
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:29,956
They soaked moss in seal oil.

204
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:37,800
And when they were going to make puya, they would crush that soaked moss, occassionally pouring in seal oil.

205
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:41,106
It was very white, and a little congealed.

206
00:25:41,113 --> 00:25:46,663
But those puyat need to be eaten quickly right away.

207
00:25:46,682 --> 00:25:48,482
They said it’ll "fly away."

208
00:25:48,489 --> 00:25:53,114
When left, the berries separate, and they say it "flies away."

209
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,270
Like that.

210
00:25:55,283 --> 00:26:01,058
Such good food, even little fermented fish heads.

211
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:33,239
In the winter, the one they call Itruka’ar, the "Inviting-In Feast."

212
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:39,008
People from here call that dance festival Itruka’ar.

213
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:46,977
What they call Itruka’ar has shaman songs.

214
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:52,290
When they celebrated Itruka’ar, I used to see those shamans.

215
00:26:52,309 --> 00:27:02,384
They dance those songs, with two women, and a single man to accompany them.

216
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:09,490
And these people who wanted to [would dance songs] they knew even though they weren’t shamans.

217
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:14,234
My late father would write songs because they said he was skilled.

218
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,390
That’s what this Itruka’ar celebration is.

219
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:22,597
They would practice what they called the Itruka’ar celebration.

220
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:29,472
This other one, the Messenger Feast. Now that was a dance festival.

221
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:35,448
When villages held the Messenger Feast

222
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:39,410
This host village like this

223
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:53,177
Let me give this meaning: if you want to send an invitation, if you have a request, you would send to men, kevgak [messengers], to Tuntutuliar.

224
00:27:53,177 --> 00:28:00,232
Tell them and instruct them [on your requestions], like that.

225
00:28:00,232 --> 00:28:04,682
When these two messengers traveled

226
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:16,872
The request of a child’s father from their home village, they would get and invite his cousin at their destination.

227
00:28:16,872 --> 00:28:20,872
Then he would [make a request] the same way, like that.

228
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:26,507
They would have some requests when they held the Messenger Feast

229
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:35,757
Guns, steel traps, a sled, they would want various things.

230
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:40,042
They’d also ask their cousins to help them.

231
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:47,742
Then when as they had more Western contact, they’d ask for huge tents.

232
00:28:47,747 --> 00:28:51,157
They’d want tents.

233
00:28:51,157 --> 00:28:58,567
They’d also ask him to [?bring] a gun so new that it had the color of feces.

234
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:06,337
They said, you know, diarrhea with crowberries is black. That’s why [they say that].

235
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:13,192
That’s what the dance festival, Messenger Feast, was like where I was born.

236
00:29:13,192 --> 00:29:17,742
I also participated in the Messenger Feast like that.

237
00:29:41,342 --> 00:29:50,572
The people back then, our ancestors, practiced shamanism.

238
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:56,162
Our ancestors back then didn’t live any which way.

239
00:29:57,202 --> 00:30:03,622
They practiced that shamanism with complete faith.

240
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:16,647
The ones who try to help a sick person’s body, those without malicious intent, those who do not think maliciously of others

241
00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:30,072
When people practiced that shamanism, they practiced it correctly with faith, and abode by their laws.

242
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:43,297
They set this time period: they tell the one they’re trying to save not to use a knife for five days.

243
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:45,907
Like that.

244
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:54,232
Look, they said, since one of them is true

245
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:57,312
You know, let me come closer to tell it

246
00:30:57,317 --> 00:31:03,627
You know that Satan was God’s partner, that head angel?

247
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:12,117
Then since it’s true, he obeys one who believes him.

248
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:16,512
But they didn’t practice it frivolously in any old way.

249
00:31:16,512 --> 00:31:23,042
The one they’re going to use their shaman power on, I used to see shamans call upon their helping spirits with drums in the community house.

250
00:31:23,812 --> 00:31:26,772
Then they said that in the past back then

251
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:41,447
They said that two shamans would bring in the one they were going use their power on side by side into the community house, a woman and a man.

252
00:31:43,852 --> 00:31:52,802
Then they said that when (s)he was sometimes [healed] well, those two worked together on his impurities

253
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:58,822
They got rid of all of his impurities.

254
00:31:58,827 --> 00:32:03,322
They said the one who couldn’t walk coming in would walk out.

255
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:07,032
They got rid of all of his ailment.

256
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:09,212
Like that.

257
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:38,717
We had a traditional isntruction back when we were young

258
00:32:38,717 --> 00:32:45,327
Especially about a shovel, or an ice pick, a walking staff

259
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:52,062
They also spoke about that staff as a life[line] for a person.

260
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:59,592
Also, this was one of their important instructions:

261
00:33:00,872 --> 00:33:13,972
You know, [what we call] imarnitet in Yup’ik, people used to use those seal gut rain parkas back then before they had Western raingear.

262
00:33:14,397 --> 00:33:19,992
Then for those of us who were born after Western contact

263
00:33:19,992 --> 00:33:32,502
Our parents used to instruct us to especially keep our raingear with us even if the weather looked good.

264
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:42,162
Since the weather sometimes doesn’t end the way it started in the spring or fall

265
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:52,222
They would tell us to especially have those with us.

266
00:33:52,222 --> 00:34:01,442
If we don’t have a walkin gstick, since we fumble around, and we don’t know how dangerous something is.

267
00:34:01,817 --> 00:34:13,147
Or if we travel in the winter, they would tell us to always carry a shovel though the weather is good.

268
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:19,857
It turned out that if we got into misfortune in the wilderness, or a blizzard starts on us

269
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:30,672
When the weather turns on us, they also instruct us not to stop at a small snowbank.

270
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:35,892
But they also said that if we don’t have a tarpaulin

271
00:34:35,897 --> 00:34:44,967
If we have a shovel, dig into a snowbank that’s already formed

272
00:34:46,487 --> 00:34:50,057
They told us to stay in that.

273
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:56,472
But also, we should get a wooden [staff] to poke a hole in that.

274
00:34:56,472 --> 00:35:01,772
When it gets hot, poke holes to let the [stale] air out.

275
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:12,997
Those were the important traditional instructions given to us from our ancestors back then.

276
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:43,957
I had this thought last spring on the verge of summer:

277
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:51,290
"Oh my, one of my old hunting grounds inland, when summer sets

278
00:35:52,470 --> 00:36:00,890
"Let me go see one of the places I’d walk around with an open canoe with a small motor."

279
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:12,675
Then when there was no more ice in the summer, we portaged through Tevyaraq upriver from Tuluksak to the headwaters of Elaayak.

280
00:36:12,685 --> 00:36:15,905
We went downriver from there.

281
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,750
When we came across a larger hill as we went downriver, I’d stop and look from that vantage point.

282
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,750
When I went to look from that vantage point, I’d come across this empty pop can.

283
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:42,350
And as I traveled this river with a boat motor, I would see a plastic [bag] draped over tree branches.

284
00:36:42,355 --> 00:36:45,015
It was stuck there.

285
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,800
I kept seeing those.

286
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:52,595
And I didn’t think anything when I first started seeing them.

287
00:36:52,605 --> 00:37:03,835
Eventualy, you see, as we were far downriver over there, because there were empty pop cans in every vantage point I looked from

288
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:16,305
I had the thought, "Oh my, look at how messy our children are, not like our ancestors."

289
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,790
This are the most prominent: empty pop cans, plastic bags

290
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,090
In their berry-picking grounds are also diapers

291
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:37,640
And their camping grounds are always filled with debris, without those being put away.

292
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:45,505
Long ago in our ancestors’ time, you see, this land was pristine.

293
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,950
There was no debris. There was none of that.

294
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,290
There were no empty pop cans, metal things, plastic things, or used diapers.

295
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,620
And eventually, there were also old drift nets

296
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:14,695
Here on to the headwaters of the Kuskokwim, and in Akula inland, [nets] that were set all winter.

297
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:21,600
They’re polluted, pollute nature with fish, and pollute the land.

298
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:30,210
And yesterday, when Matthew Beans was telling his stories, he told this story:

299
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:34,135
He said that when he travels to villages by plane

300
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:44,520
When he gets close to villages, he sees a lot of those plastic bags and cardboard things, when he gets close to villages

301
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,190
The things the wind blew like a blizzard.

302
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:57,245
I had this idea last spring when I saw too many of those when I traveled through there:

303
00:38:57,255 --> 00:39:05,675
That I should talk about those in church, or that I should point those out even if it's not at church.

304
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:42,980
Our ancestors were clean, always keeping their land here cleaned up out of reverence.

305
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:45,565
And as they did that

306
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:56,760
They also didn't pollute their water out of reverence, the Kuskokwim, even if it wasn't the Kuskokwim, the lakes and creeks.

307
00:39:56,765 --> 00:40:00,205
They also didn't let their hunting-gathering lands become polluted.

308
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:10,160
Our ancestors always kept it cleaned up, saying this: "The Spirit of the Universe is watching us."

309
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:15,045
They say the Spirit of the Universe watches us, without leaving anyone out.

310
00:40:15,055 --> 00:40:21,925
Those who are knowledgeable read the Bible, and I read it too.

311
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:25,445
It says this in Psalms 24:

312
00:40:25,455 --> 00:40:35,175
"To Jehovah belong the earth and that which fills it, the productive land and those dwellingin it." [NWT]

313
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:43,530
How pitiful, we who pollute our land these days.

314
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:54,810
Calling ourselves believers, will we be believers who pollute our air and lands?

315
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:04,210
I pondered and realized that we believes will not have [polluted] air like that.

316
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:11,580
Our land, where we stay in the winter, and our hunting grounds in the wilderness

317
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:18,375
We must keep it like a cleaned up house

318
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:24,805
And our air, our hunting grounds, our fishing grounds, and our Kuskokwim River.

319
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:32,700
And these days, as I go on the Kuskokwim, I would see an empty pop can drifting down here.

320
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:39,375
And yet, it’s our food source, and our income source.

321
00:41:39,385 --> 00:41:43,505
How foul, what will happen when it rusts?

322
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,620
You see, our ancestors back then said this:

323
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:51,915
They said that these fish are easily repulsed.

324
00:41:51,925 --> 00:42:02,105
They said that if there’s anything bad in the river, the fish won’t go in it because water is their livelihood

325
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:07,960
Because they know that if they go on it, they’ll die before they reach its headwaters.

326
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:13,745
They said fish have never been able to go in polluted water since a long time ago.

327
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,530
Taking care of the land and taking care of the water

328
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:30,900
Starting from from our ancestors long ago, they have admonishments of what they’ve understood over the course of millions millions [of] year[s], true things.

329
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:38,135
They only have admonishments about true things, what they understood, what they’ve seen with their own eyes.

330
00:42:38,145 --> 00:42:45,995
Since it’s like that these days, let’s take a look around.

331
00:42:46,005 --> 00:42:52,025
Things are depleting, and fish are depleting these days

332
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:58,560
Because we don’t revere the water and our lands, because we’ve polluted them.

333
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:29,245
Can’t we incinerate these?

334
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:38,970
Or, we must leave cover them up under the land to keep our land cleaned up.

335
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:48,500
You with good houses know that you don’t want your house to be dirty.

336
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:56,970
These are more important: your land, your air, your hunting grounds.

337
00:43:56,975 --> 00:44:07,625
You must carefully watch than more than your own bed in your home, and keep it cleaned up.

338
00:44:07,635 --> 00:44:15,995
Since our land is polluted these days, God cannot bless it.

339
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:27,230
He decreases things, decreases fish populations, and seems to decrease these plants.

340
00:44:27,235 --> 00:44:31,825
He cannot bless a polluted land.

341
00:44:32,015 --> 00:44:41,025
Let us not put it upon another person or to the West, but to us who live in this land.

342
00:44:41,035 --> 00:44:52,495
Cleaning those up, and watching them, let’s put it upon ourselves, not shift it to someone else.

343
00:44:52,720 --> 00:45:04,720
As wou don’t watch over it, and as we don’t instruct our youth to utilize it reverantly, we’ve let it become like that

344
00:45:04,725 --> 00:45:08,535
Because we keep [knowledge] from our youth.

345
00:45:35,475 --> 00:45:47,045
From here on out, let’s instruct them to keep the land clear, and pristine.

346
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:58,075
Undoubtedly, when our land becomes pristine, God will bless it with abundance like our ancestors.

347
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:06,600
He will not let anything become scarce, but what we use here in this land will be available.

348
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:13,200
Birds, little animals, caribout, and minks can [be plentiful] like that.

349
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:17,600
In our ancestors’ stories back then, they say

350
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:27,550
When their fish traps were full and couldn’t take in any more, they’d stop catching minks.

351
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:30,465
Everything was in plenty back then.

352
00:46:30,475 --> 00:46:38,785
Since the land was cleared up and pristine like this, God blessed it like that.

353
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:44,075
Every kind of meat had an instruction.

354
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:50,080
They said to leave the excess that we won’t use in a pit.

355
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:57,670
And if we see a caribou bone, or some other animal bone in the wilderness

356
00:46:57,675 --> 00:47:04,415
If there’s no lake nearby, they said to leave it buried into the land.

357
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:09,820
If there’s lake nearby, they said to throw that bone into that lake.

358
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:18,800
Our ancestors had that instruction to keep the land that they saw pristine.

359
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:26,360
I got the intention to say that when I returned home from my travels last spring.

360
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:37,960
Our caretakers [did not let us] let it be this polluted, the creator, the owner of the land cannot bless it.

361
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:16,300
Since I am thankful for this to our youth here, I want to give this one more instruction.

362
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:20,285
When I first got married

363
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,740
When I got married, or when I also had children

364
00:48:27,745 --> 00:48:36,045
Since my father downriver wouldn’t hold back when instructing me back then

365
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:44,210
He would instruct me like this: a child, should we happen to have children

366
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:55,490
He said not to ask them questions though they come in crying, or ask what happened and who did it.

367
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,210
He said not to feel defensive over them.

368
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:08,380
Watch, he said, if we defend them, that little child will become able to have us believe [lies].

369
00:49:08,385 --> 00:49:14,775
As we go, they could make us upset at one of our friends.

370
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:22,605
Then when it’s time for them, they also go to school now.

371
00:49:23,555 --> 00:49:33,105
He said that (s)he will not listen though people admonish them, because he said we are their defenders.

372
00:49:34,335 --> 00:49:45,025
Since I especially wanted to say thank out of gratitude for your coming, I just spoke about it.

373
00:50:12,155 --> 00:50:18,635
Well, to this thign they talked about, especially now

374
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:29,100
They didn’t have absolutely none of these when we were born, because we were born after Western contact.

375
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:37,950
But when they got these fast motors, that especially

376
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:46,985
Getting these traveling implements and vehicles are especially what’s making people drop [dead].

377
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:55,850
Also, them using mind-altering substances probably makes them do that too.

378
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:04,380
Back in my time, all of the stores down there in Bethel sold liquor.

379
00:51:04,385 --> 00:51:15,895
But since they didn’t have fast traveling devices back then, though they [sold it] like that, they didn’t know [of any accidents].

380
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:26,650
We do instruct our children here, and I also speak to my children

381
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:32,720
But these days like that, and like my parents

382
00:51:33,681 --> 00:51:38,451
I watched my late parent [give instruction] and myself.

383
00:51:38,461 --> 00:51:45,361
But now, I can’t [instruct] them exactly like him.

384
00:51:46,266 --> 00:51:56,446
I did that because they might feel offended, or that they might go the wrong way. Turns out, I made a mistake.

385
00:51:56,981 --> 00:52:08,111
Yes, if I love them, then I must not hold back talking to them about every danger

386
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:11,961
So that they will remember them.

387
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:24,496
Many times now, those who separate from their parents do not live right.

388
00:52:24,506 --> 00:52:33,606
Also, those who do not practice the traditional wisdom passed down to them are like they’re [lost] underfoot.

389
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:47,811
And though one tries not to be heard of in other villages, it’s like that person is shuddering at the top of a pole when they don’t practice traditional wisdom.

390
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:57,500
However, one who practices their traditional wisdom is like they’re not there, and like they’re not there even in neighboring villages.

391
00:53:21,494 --> 00:53:25,931
Taking care of the land, and taking care of the water

392
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:37,338
Starting from from our ancestors long ago, they have admonishments of what they’ve understood over the course of millions millions [of] year[s], true things.

393
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:44,427
They only have admonishments about true things, what they understood, what they’ve seen with their own eyes.

394
00:53:44,439 --> 00:53:52,328
Since it’s like that these days, let’s take a look around.

395
00:53:52,343 --> 00:53:58,354
Things are depleting, and fish are depleting these days

396
00:53:58,357 --> 00:54:04,977
Because we don’t revere the water and our land and pollute them.

397
00:54:06,017 --> 00:54:09,872
Can’t we incinerate these?

398
00:54:09,886 --> 00:54:19,663
Or, we should leave them buried in the land to keep our land cleaned up.

399
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:28,967
You with good houses know that you don’t want your house to be dirty.

400
00:54:29,341 --> 00:54:37,263
This is more important: your land, your air, and your hunting grounds.

401
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:48,086
You must especially watch over it more than your own beds at home, keeping it cleaned up.

402
00:54:48,096 --> 00:54:56,507
Since our land is polluted like this these days, God cannot bless it.

403
00:54:56,518 --> 00:55:07,873
He depletes things, depletes fish, and seems to deplete these plants.

404
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:12,199
He cannot bless a polluted land.

405
00:55:12,206 --> 00:55:21,473
Let’s not put it upon another pesron or the West, but upon ourselves who live in the land.

406
00:55:21,479 --> 00:55:33,034
Let’s put it upon ourselves to clean those up, to watch over them, not move [the responsibility] to another person.

407
00:55:33,044 --> 00:55:45,326
Since we don’t watch over it, and since we don’t instruct our youth to utilize it reverently, we’ve let it become like that

408
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:49,122
Because we keep it from our youth.

409
00:55:49,140 --> 00:56:00,770
From here on out, let’s instruct them to keep the land clear and pristine.

410
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:11,650
Undoubtedly, when our land becomes pristine, God will bless it by makes things plentiful like our ancestors[’ time].

411
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:20,230
He will not make anything scarce, but what we use here on this land will be available.

412
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:26,760
Birds, little animals, caribout, and minks can [be plentiful] like that.

413
00:56:26,765 --> 00:56:31,385
In our ancestors’ stories back then, they say

414
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:41,130
They said that when their fish traps were full and couldn’t take in any more, they would stop catching minks.

415
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,080
Everything was plentiful back then.

416
00:56:44,085 --> 00:56:52,475
Since the land was cleared up and pristine like this, God blessed it like that.

417
00:56:52,485 --> 00:56:57,725
Every kind of meat had an instruction.

418
00:56:57,733 --> 00:57:03,673
They told us to leave our excess that we won’t use buried in pits.

419
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:11,418
And if we see a caribou bone, or the bone of another animal in the wilderness

420
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:17,948
If there’s no lake near it, they said to leave it buried into the ground.

421
00:57:17,953 --> 00:57:23,493
If there’s a lake near it, they said to go throw the bone into that lake.

422
00:57:23,508 --> 00:57:32,478
Our ancestors gave that instruction to keep the land that they saw here pristine.

423
00:57:32,488 --> 00:57:40,068
I got the intention to say that when I returned home from my travels last spring.

424
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:51,329
With [the land] polluted like this, our caretaker, and the creator and owner of the land cannot bless it.

425
00:57:52,379 --> 00:57:54,429
There you have it.

426
00:57:54,439 --> 00:58:05,679
Then also, you see, cleaning up this land is very expensive.

427
00:58:07,214 --> 00:58:18,424
Over there, you see, this year, I see people earning money by cleaning up the land.

428
00:58:18,434 --> 00:58:20,994
And yet they’re called cleaner uppers.

429
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:24,169
They only have their eyes on money these days.

430
00:58:24,174 --> 00:58:29,544
In our ancestors’ time back then, however, they didn’t look at money.

431
00:58:30,454 --> 00:58:37,894
Instead, our ancestors back then kept their eyes on how they could live for a long time.

432
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:42,329
They were like this:

433
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:53,199
In their villages, they didn’t let grass grow.

434
00:58:53,204 --> 00:58:57,844
They’d clean up their villages after letting the grass grow.

435
00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:03,179
Then in the winter, they always shoveled their paths.

436
00:59:03,184 --> 00:59:08,244
Our ancestors also always shoveled their paths for hauling water.

437
00:59:08,259 --> 00:59:13,209
Because they were like that, their land was blessed.

438
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:19,689
And those who cleaned up

439
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:24,779
They said this:

440
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:35,489
"Live your life with a propensity do [clean up] debris, to clean up without thinking of money. Cleaning up is expensive.

441
00:59:35,494 --> 00:59:43,274
"So that in the future, when you look back, you will have food every time.

442
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:53,519
"Then as there is food like that in your future, you will live for a long time on earth."

443
00:59:53,524 --> 00:59:56,564
That is the promise of cleaning up.

444
00:59:56,579 --> 00:59:59,959
It’s no wonder that in my earliest memories back then

445
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:09,894
I saw old women and old men walking by supporting themselves on their knees, unable to stretch out [to full height].

446
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:16,584
They were such old men and old women that they did that.

447
01:00:17,379 --> 01:00:25,989
It turned out that because our ancestors, even women, would clean up their village

448
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:34,389
They would live a long time, and start walking by supporting themselves with their knees.

449
01:00:34,399 --> 01:00:40,069
That’s the reward for one who cleans up.

450
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,899
Then they would tell these stories:

451
01:00:43,904 --> 01:00:54,084
They say this man in his prime was not like his peers, lacking. And his name was Picuilnguq [Bad Hunter].

452
01:00:54,509 --> 01:00:58,029
And though he hunted, he couldn’t catch anything.

453
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:04,004
They say that some of those who desire to be like these good hunters

454
01:01:04,014 --> 01:01:10,974
They start cleaning up their villages though no one tells them to.

455
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:19,449
Being ashamed of being bad hunters, they start cleaning up those villages.

456
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:26,159
When they do that, when they practice that

457
01:01:26,169 --> 01:01:38,889
One who does that becomes a better hunter than those who are called great hunters, and those who catch a lot, when he cleans up.

458
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:54,388
This is what it is: since God is thankful for that person who cleans up his land, he rewards him with what he wants, and he receives that reward.

459
01:01:54,388 --> 01:02:01,388
He will make him like that for the length of his life, living without being in need.

460
01:02:01,395 --> 01:02:05,333
Cleaning up brings great rewards.
