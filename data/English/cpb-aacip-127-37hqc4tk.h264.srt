1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,710
...Neresgaaq would probably laugh about it like that.

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:17,210
Can you talk to me about what you heard about the first Western contact? They probably mean the barge.

3
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:18,195
Huh?

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:27,540
The large sea vessel, you know, the funny things you used to hear about what Yupiit were amazed by.

5
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:30,665
Should I tell you stories about that first?

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,660
Yes.

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,680
I won’t say too much about a long story. (That’s okay.)

8
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:43,105
And after I say what I need to say, I won’t speak for too long.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,670
Okay.

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:57,960
I grew up hearing hearsay about a shaman who lived across in Apruka’armiut whom they called Ississaayuk.

11
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,890
They said that he would start speaking as he was drumming.

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:13,450
They said to see that unrelated different people would burst out through the warmth.

13
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:19,095
He learned to speak with those.

14
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:26,320
They said that one day, they asked him to do it because they wanted to see it.

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:37,210
He complied and spoke like a Westerner.

16
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:46,220
I’m probably telling this story forgetting about some parts.

17
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:55,570
They said that when summer set and the ice on the Kuskokwim broke, a huge ship went upriver through the Kuskokwim.

18
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:03,320
And they say it stopped across there toward the water from Cinik, toward the water from Qemiterak.

19
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:17,305
They say that when the curious unsuitable ones went to go see it paddling kayaks, the ones who recently lost family members or whose daughters were in their first years of menstruations

20
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,500
When they couldn’t reach it, they would go home, unable to get close to it.

21
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,990
They say that only a select few would reach it

22
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,410
That huge floating ship had a lot of Caucasians.

23
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:42,675
They said that on the side toward the end, their eyes tended to shut.

24
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:51,070
They said that when they were going to speak, speak amongst themselves

25
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:57,590
They would only speak English to their peers after going "aa-a."

26
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:02,085
They said that it had two masts.

27
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:12,715
They said that on the ropes between the masts up there, a little moose was repeatedly untying.

28
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:23,030
They also said that one Caucasian up there was always pointing to the east.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,830
Doesn’t his arm ever get tired?

30
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,210
He was their compass.

31
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:42,755
I also used to hear about Illugngali, an old story.

32
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:47,395
The infamous Illugngali who was not short tempered.

33
00:03:50,685 --> 00:04:02,385
They said that his name, it may have happened after. It may not have happened before.

34
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:13,840
They said that he... I will place my [?] Illugngali later, okay?

35
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:18,305
They said the Caucasians called him Kallugngali.

36
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:27,055
They said that the ones who arrived looked for the leader of the Kuskokwim, calling him Illugngali.

37
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,210
And yet they say they didn’t know him.

38
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:39,945
They said that the next year, another ship came. It was different, unlike that one.

39
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:48,375
They said that it started giving out good things that people wanted.

40
00:04:49,732 --> 00:05:04,499
They said that when Ississaayuk’s daughter started giving things out that ship, probably the first one

41
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:11,709
She would admonish them, saying that they were illusions and would disappear when they left.

42
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:19,794
He told her to buy as much as she wanted only when the next one came.

43
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,866
They abandoneed this first ship.

44
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,582
He said that it was only a fable.

45
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:42,949
The next year when the next one came down, arrived and anchored there, the kayaks went down like that along with Illugngali.

46
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:47,956
They said that they were sending something to Illugngali.

47
00:05:50,309 --> 00:06:00,355
And they say that they gave Illugngali a big beautiful metal necklace that looked like a side labret.

48
00:06:00,391 --> 00:06:04,609
They say they delivered it to him. They say that they loved him.

49
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:13,617
The many Caucasians looked out smiling at him as he docked his kayak on that ship.

50
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:20,382
[?And they said that when he drank alcohol as he was going out, he was going] "eru-eru-eru."

51
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:28,968
"The devil is going to defecate," he said as he pulled down that Caucasian’s pants.

52
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:32,752
I wonder what would come from the devil’s bowels?

53
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:40,356
When he dropped a large cylindrical piece of feces, he went, "Ee."

54
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:42,854
And he defecated normally.

55
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:51,508
They said that one of the ones grinning looking out up there [?].

56
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:57,553
But they said that he was holding herring eggs in the hood of his skin parka.

57
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:05,386
Illugngali was angered because he was short tempered.

58
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,946
Eventually, one up there took him.

59
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:18,607
He took his woman’s figted necklace and threw it into the water.

60
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:22,431
He had the Caucasians up there watch him.

61
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:29,595
They said that Illugngali talked all day starting in the morning.

62
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:35,180
They said that eventually, something grew out of the corners of his mouth and was seeping something white.

63
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:44,100
And then the tide rose, and what was full flowed out.

64
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:49,163
It lowered as Illugngali was talking.

65
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:55,497
Death came firs to the one who [?] him.

66
00:07:57,425 --> 00:08:04,161
They said that even though they went home, the cargo they left didn’t disappear.

67
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:15,080
They said that one who understood the very first ship that came at the time said:

68
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:22,230
They said that the devil is writing papers from here in Alaska.

69
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:25,052
The devil was staying in a hotel.

70
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:34,110
They say that its accompanying devil, the first ship, shows it

71
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,909
Eyes that close on its side.

72
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:52,466
I’m telling this story from what little I heard told to me, possibly forgetting some parts.

73
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:59,834
The electrician across there that was curious about the one who defecated

74
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:08,054
I just told it how I heard it, and I probably changed it.

75
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:15,842
What kind of stories do you want me to tell? What our ancestors were like or what?

76
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:19,443
What about the thigns the West brought back then?

77
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:20,034
What?

78
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:22,982
You know, the things the West brought?

79
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:24,737
What about them?

80
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:34,780
You know, the new things that they brought like flour or sugar or other things.

81
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,117
You mean [?food]?

82
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:38,272
Yes, or any other things.

83
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:39,691
The things...

84
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:44,050
And the machines, like boat motors or snowmachines.

85
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:50,550
Those machines were probably not the first.

86
00:09:50,557 --> 00:10:01,727
Yes, but you know, the funny ways that people were amazed by them when they first appeared. You know, what you heard about their thoughts or what you did.

87
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:07,907
I didn’t come upon those.

88
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:17,377
But these people from Kwethluk over there were left alone without going to fish camps.

89
00:10:18,622 --> 00:10:31,672
After that, a huge barge, not a ship, a barge, drifted ashore to Curirneq down there.

90
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:37,632
They said that it carried food, flour.

91
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:43,522
But they said that they did not carry tea.

92
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:49,672
They said that it only had cigarettes made from real tobacco leaves.

93
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:57,267
And they said that they had clothes made from caribou and good small caribou skin sleds.

94
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:06,847
But they said that even though its seld had a rope as thick as straight spruce saplings, it snapped.

95
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:18,657
They said that they spilled various things from [the sacks], spilled flour and took out their containers and dropped them.

96
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:22,582
They used their containers for sewing fabric.

97
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:30,557
They said that the barge’s leeward side had a huge mound of the flour they spilled.

98
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:34,922
And it surpassed the roof of that barge.

99
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:49,197
They said that when the tide came in high in Cuirneq down there, the flour would settle down all day before the current took it out as the tide went out.

100
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:56,252
The floating flour would also be pulled by pulled by the sunken flour on Cuirneq.

101
00:11:57,262 --> 00:12:00,812
They said that before it returned, the current would flow again.

102
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:09,542
They spilled out the flour to the ground from the [sacks] that were filled with food.

103
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:18,907
They spilled them out because they didn’t know what they were, saying that they were going to use them for water containers and pots.

104
00:12:21,092 --> 00:12:26,872
They only tell those stories about how they didn’t know Western things.

105
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:33,227
They said that they only looked for tobacco inside that boat

106
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:38,072
Because they said they first learned how to use tobacco.

107
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:44,562
They said that they first learned how to use Russian tobacco.

108
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:49,817
They said that that barge was carrying tobacco.

109
00:12:50,602 --> 00:13:02,042
And they said that it didn’t carry tea, but carried what was apparently unground coffee.

110
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:11,757
They said that those who had learned by repeatedly going to Caucasians, right when they were about to be depleted

111
00:13:12,072 --> 00:13:19,672
And the [containers] that they took out and disposed of, when butter was getting low

112
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:29,047
They said that Kanaqlak arrived on a boat, the father of Tarruy’ak and family.

113
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:42,837
When he recognized them and he put them into his boat, some suddenly went to him but were late and some didn’t have any

114
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:52,727
These Western foods like [shortening], things with berries, and syrup

115
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:59,927
The things they didn’t eat and spilled out our of fear.

116
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:09,727
That’s all for that story. There’s a lot to tell about it.

117
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:19,507
They said that those who didn’t go to fish camp [stopped fishing for flounders] and ate pancakes or frybread all summer

118
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:24,532
Those pancakes or frybread.

119
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:28,537
Oh my goodness.

120
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:37,452
They didn’t prepare for tomorrow. They said that they focused on the flour sacks to use as sewing fabric.

121
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:42,252
They did that when sewing fabric was scarce.

122
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:54,192
If they brought in flour every year, the wise ones would keep what was inside.

123
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:55,977
Yes.

124
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:06,152
They did that, wanting to bring in sewing fabric.

125
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:17,872
From what I’ve seen, these boat motors, machines, snowgos, and these boat motors came first.

126
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:29,062
So, you know, did you hear funny stories about the things they were amazed by?

127
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:43,702
Kakianeq, Mistussiikaq, who traded here in Anuuraaq, he first traded before he came here to Kwigillingok.

128
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:52,612
He would get things because he had a huge double boat made of old skin.

129
00:15:54,447 --> 00:16:02,377
He would disappear out into the ocean with a sail to Quinhagak. Apparently, he would cross to Quinhagak.

130
00:16:03,277 --> 00:16:07,267
They said his parent was a Caucasian named Mistussiikaq.

131
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:18,377
He would arrive having filled his boat with flour, sugar, tea, and tobacco.

132
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:29,892
Yet in the fall, he would distribute them to people in the Canineq region going up north to this side of Nelson Island.

133
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:33,362
They said he was racking credit.

134
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:47,667
In the winter, however, right when it froze, he collected their debt, using a sled to visit those who were indebted.

135
00:16:48,842 --> 00:17:00,882
One summer, he brought an instrument, what turned out to be an instrument with pipes.

136
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:10,497
Their instruments looked like little [canisters], unlike the [?malik’itaat].

137
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:26,812
When he was going to play the instrument, everyone from Keggukarmiut, even the old men and women, would go upriver to listen to him.

138
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:33,702
And people would come from Nunapigmiut downriver to listen.

139
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:42,837
Eventually, he brought boat motors that would just be set on their boats.

140
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:55,197
My goodness. When he loaded his big boat and was going to travel back and forth on Keggukar with a boat motor

141
00:17:55,897 --> 00:18:05,087
Every person from those villages would go to the coast to watch him.

142
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:17,527
I heard that my maternal uncle Angassaaqun was a reindeer herder upriver along with other people.

143
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:23,967
One day, you see, Angassaaqun arrived.

144
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:34,802
And when he arrived, he took those instruments and those boat motors, then took them away.

145
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:41,762
Apparently, he traded them for live female reindeer.

146
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:52,547
And he went across to Paru upriver from Keggukar, the Caucasian named Paru

147
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:59,817
He would arrive with skiffs with sails.

148
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:10,992
However, some of the ones who wanted to trade for them traded live female reindeer

149
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:15,232
The thigns the skiffs first brought.

150
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:18,882
Paru did.

151
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:27,317
Once in a while, he would come on a skiff bringing many things.

152
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:33,902
I didn’t see a lot of Caucasians on the Kuskowkim.

153
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:46,207
Each year, there were more Caucasians. And there were more ships coming in.

154
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:54,222
Some of the ships brought those good things.

155
00:19:54,402 --> 00:20:05,302
Then one day, I heard that a Caucasian by the name of Neqliyaq arrived over in Apruka’ar with a multitude of ships.

156
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:19,007
When that person from Canineq fished in the summer, Isqaq down there would be covered with tents for the people of Chefornak who were drift netting.

157
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:32,427
And across there along Apruka’ar, there would be many tents going all the way to Kuiguyugmiut.

158
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:37,887
There were also people from Cingigpak upriver in Anllermiut.

159
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:40,762
They said they were his fishers.

160
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:48,177
He beautified the people.

161
00:20:49,982 --> 00:21:02,022
They started wearing Western made clothes, cloth pants for the men, and cloth dresses for the women.

162
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:06,207
They also got dishpans for bowls.

163
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,892
There was also an increase in kettles.

164
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:15,782
They were seen everywhere...
