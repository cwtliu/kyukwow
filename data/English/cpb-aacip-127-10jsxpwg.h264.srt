1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Do you want to start?

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,500
Okay, is it time to start? (Yes, yes.)

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Look, can we just introduce ourselves?

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:23,00
Okay, these people. Their names.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
Ann [?].

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
From? (From Bethel.)

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Are you a teacher, or what?

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:38,000
No, I work for [?], and I work for YKHC.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
[?]

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,800
I’m Lucy Sparck and I work here at KCC.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,000
Introduce them. We can’t hear [?] their names.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, over there…

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
…for animals.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:10,000
These, back when we were young and [did not watch them] well

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Before we watched the ones working on them who were alive.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:33,000
Our caretakers, however, had instructions for these animals of the wilderness.

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:44,000
They would instruct us until we would not waste it.

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:56,500
They also told us not to delibirately hunt something we would not use, saying that it would get wasted.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Instead, they would respect animals they hunted in the wilderness.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:17,600
Those who respected them also [passed] those on to us because our ancestors took good care of them

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Not wasting or polluting with them because they gave us those instructions.

22
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:42,800
And then afterwards, we started seeing those pieces of traditional wisdom that were given to us

23
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:53,500
If we’re not going to eat it, not to deliberately kill it.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,400
But if we're going to eat it, they told us to [hunt it] and not to pollute nature with it.

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Also, because it’s warm in the winter

26
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,000
If we kill that [animal] as we’re somewhere in the wilderness

27
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,500
If it starts to smell, they told us not to throw it on the ground.

28
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:34,500
Instead, after digging into the land, cover it. 

29
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,800
We had that instruction.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Also…

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,600
One moment. That’s going to be translated.

32
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,900
What’s the matter? Is it too long or what?

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,800
No, finish what you were saying first. (Okay.)

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You know, how they told them only to dig and put those.

35
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes, dig into the ground.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,500
Don’t throw it on the ground, but after digging into the land, cover it there.

37
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:33,000
Also, if we have some of this food that has gone bad which we won’t eat

38
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,500
They said to put it where people have not and will not tread upon.

39
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:53,000
Those were our instructions from those who raised us.

40
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:09,000
We also had instructions for the wilderness because we hunt these things on the land

41
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,500
Because our familes and we used animal traps.

42
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:26,500
They also told us to respect what that person had caught because it’s not ours.

43
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:41,000
We also had instructions that if that one was going to go or if we see an animal to kill it

44
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,500
And hang it there so that when the owner comes to it before leaving

45
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,500
That person will be thankful that someone had done that to what he had caught.

46
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They told us not to steal it because it’s not ours. We had that admonishment.

47
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
They say a person can learn to do this.

48
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:19,800
One can also learn to talk another person’s possession that is not his own.

49
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,000
Those had admonishments for us.

50
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:35,500
But, they said that we should only use what we caught withought taking another person’s.

51
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:46,000
These are the instructions we had from those who raised us back then.

52
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,000
That is all from me.

53
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,500
Okay…

54
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:01,000
…we didn’t have instructions concerning [their days].

55
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:12,900
But, we hear that from the direction of the ocean or if it suddenly gets foggy

56
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If the water suddenly gets foggy, we upriver people sometimes say

57
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
“So, someone has caught something in the ocean.”

58
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,500
When it gets foggy like that, we say that they caught something, that we think they caught something.

59
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,700
He said that…

60
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,400
…here.

61
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,000
Upriver here? (Yes, land animals.)

62
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,000
These land animals…

63
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hey, if you know, please explain about some of those, how the land animals [are treated].

64
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:12,500
Our ancestors back then took care of revered land animals.

65
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,000
You know, they didn’t pollute nature with them.

66
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,500
They and the ones I saw took good care of them.

67
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:34,500
They also instructed us not to throw their bones in places with heavy traffic out of reverence.

68
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They revered and loved the animals that the men caught.

69
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,000
And they didn’t[carelessly] throw even their bones away.

70
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,500
They always dug and covered their bones.

71
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,800
They used to have people dispose of them like that a long time ago.

72
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,000
There was no mess in all of the land.

73
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,300
Before there were these cans, these various Western garbage materials, there was no [waste] on the land.

74
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,000
There was no visible mess or paper materials.

75
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,000
The land was good with no mess.

76
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,900
The people revered their land.

77
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,900
They revered their land, including the areas around them.

78
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They also used to instruct us.

79
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,000
The places we women subsist, our berry picking lands, where we tread, and our egg hunting lands

80
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,400
They told us that if we stop at those not leave it messy.

81
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:58,000
They also told us never to leave our food scraps, whatever leftovers we had, in open places as messes

82
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,000
Instead, always dig and cover them.

83
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:11,600
The people back then, including their land, was not like now.

84
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,300
They respected this land. They respected it in their lives.

85
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, she said that…

86
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:40,700
Truly, I do not leave anything when I pick berries. (Did they tell youpl?)

87
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,400
When we [pick] berries… (I wouldn’t leave berries when I picked them.)

88
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:51,000
I even take a single little seed and put it in my bucket.

89
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,500
And the place I picked berries has nothing because I think like this

90
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,700
I always think like this:

91
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
“God put this here. He made it grow here.

92
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,900
“I will not [gather] without being thorough and scatttering them.”

93
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
These days, since we’ve recently gotten this [religion], this is how I think when I pick berries.

94
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,000
I also take a single berry all the same without saying there are bigger ones.

95
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,000
And sometimes, there is a single seed growing on a stem.

96
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,800
I also peel that off and put it in even though it takes up my time.

97
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,500
I am honestly talking about my personal custom.

98
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Okay, she’s answering it, this, from…

99
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,000
At that time, there were a great many birds.

100
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There were also a great many ptarmigans.

101
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Before there were these governement workers with laws

102
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,500
People used to hunt in the spring for birds and ptarmigans.

103
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:25,500
But what they caught, because salt came early in our time

104
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,500
We would preserve those birds with salt before they spoiled.

105
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:39,000
They would also hang ptarmigan meat to dry.

106
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,500
We [preserved] those like that.

107
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,500
Also, because they would sometimes have shortages back then before these [Western] nets appeared

108
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:01,400
Because we had nets and deteriorated back then that needed to be replaced every year

109
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:08,300
Sometimes, it couldn’t catch a lot of fish.

110
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:17,000
When we [hunted] those, because we didn’t have an abundant supply of guns

111
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:26,500
Because we hunted ptarmigans first, we would trap ptarmigans with snares made from twine.

112
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We used to do that because there were a lot back then

113
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:43,000
Before these Caucasians these things with their work out of state.

114
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,500
And before Alaska was covered with these numerous coats that are filled with fur

115
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,000
They were filled with bird feathers because there was a lot back then.

116
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:05,000
We used to preserve some of those birds in salt during the spring to eat them over the summer.

117
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,400
They also told us, [you know] we gather eggs in the spring like this.

118
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Because they observed these eggs

119
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,400
They would have us stop when the fetuses developed in the eggs.

120
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,500
They told us not to take eggs again because their fetuses had developed and would become birds.

121
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We also had admonishments like that for those.

122
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:46,000
Those who raised us would also tell us this

123
00:14:47,700 --> 00:15:05,900
If we also polluted nature with those things we gathered, they would tell us this:

124
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,900
If we keep polluting nature with them, our caretaker will remove those.

125
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,800
We had that traditional wisdom.

126
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,900
They said that if we pollute nature with them, he will not give them to us anymore.

127
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,500
They say that after that person is a good hunter and catches a lot, he can no longer catch anything because he pollutes nature with what he catches.

128
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,500
Okay, he mentioned [Forest] and asked him a question.

129
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,800
How did you show respect to those?

130
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:53,500
And how...cure them?

131
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Cure them? How did they cure them?

132
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,000
You make them last through the winter or…

133
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,500
Would you eat them all winter long?

134
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,400
How did you preserve them, you know, without discarding them?

135
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:20,000
How did you take care of them? Yes. (I see. How do take care of them?)

136
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,500
The habit for birds in the fall

137
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
When they start swimming, because the people back then observed them

138
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:42,000
They said that when bird chicks are small, they are not food because they’re too small before they grow.

139
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:58,000
Only when they are grown and start flapping their wings, they treat them as food only then.

140
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:07,800
A person can then [hunt] them if he wants to, and because he wouldn’t catch a lot

141
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Only once in a great while, people who are able to travel [hunt] those.

142
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Because they travel to the wilderness in September when the berries are [ready], and at the end of August

143
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Those chicks grow at that time.

144
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:42,500
But when people hunt during the time of opportunity when the chicks are good before they can fly

145
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:52,500
When the people back then caught some, they would preserve them in salt to prevent spoiling.

146
00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:03,500
If they don’t have any and they woould spoil, they would give them to their families before they spoil like that.

147
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He’s saying that when birds are, when little birds are small, he said they’re not much of food for them.

148
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,500
But only when they get bigger, people then go after them.

149
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,400
And he’s saying that, you know, from being around here, he said not everybody went after them.

150
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:37,700
But those who did, went after them and then salted them again. And if you…

151
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,000
…she asked if [they stored] those, or did they eat them right away?

152
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Back then, when some gathered eggs, when they gathered more than they needed

153
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:04,000
They don’t dig them into the ground raw, or store them, only after cooking them.

154
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,500
They’re only done and won’t spoil after cooking like that.

155
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,000
They only stored them after cooking them.

156
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,800
To where? To what?

157
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,500
I’m not sure where they stored them.

158
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,500
Some froze them, cooked and froze them, then stored them all together.

159
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:40,500
And because they had seal oil containers a long time ago, big seal pokes

160
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,500
They would store some of them in those to prepare for uncertainty

161
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Only submerging them in seal oil after cooking them.

162
00:19:52,500 --> 00:20:00,000
When it was time, they would reach in and take those eggs out.

163
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,500
Okay, he’s saying that if people take…

164
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,000
What do these people [work as]?

165
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
[S]he works, caliluni, at Fish and Wildlife. (I see.)

166
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And this one at YKHC. (I see.)

167
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:35,000
You asked me about who [we store] these seals when we catch them.

168
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,000
Yes, before there were freezers. (Okay.)

169
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,000
They want to know how they [stored food] before freezers.
(I see.)

170
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,500
No.

171
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,800
Their spirits when they catch seals down from the ocean (For their spirits.)

172
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
How do they [show respect] to their spirits?

173
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,400
What will happen to the spirit of that [seal] when it’s caught and dead?

174
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,500
No, didn’t you say that you did something to them, giving them water to drink…

175
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Oh, those. Oh, yes.

176
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Back when they caught them, even if it was a small ringed seal or even a bearded seal

177
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,500
When they caught them in the spring, brought them to land, brought them into their homes.

178
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,000
When they catch even a small ringed or even a bearded seal

179
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,900
For some reason, [s]he would [do this] here with his hands

180
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:55,500
After pouring water on his hands, open its mouth even if it’s skinny

181
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Even if it’s skinny, pour that leftover [water] in its mouth.

182
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,500
Even though its dead? (Yes, even though it’s dead.)

183
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,500
Even if that bearded seal is butchered inside that house.

184
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:15,400
And then, the first thing when a boy had his very first catch of everything, even a bearded seal

185
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,800
When one who went on his first hunting trip caught his first bearded seal

186
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,000
After doing that, pouring [water] with his hands here…
