1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
...he became my husband.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,410
Then that person said to me

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:17,340
"Now, go in. I will bring your clothes upriver later."

4
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:25,905
Upriver, we lived downriver upriver from Keggukarmiut in a place called Kelliqucirmiut.

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:35,700
Oh my, then I went in when these people woke up in the early morning

6
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:42,995
When they didn’t use stoves, when they made kettles of hot water outside in fireplaces.

7
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:54,794
Oh my, when I went in and these people watched me, I would go more quickly and look away from them.

8
00:00:54,961 --> 00:01:03,819
Oh my, when I went it, I undressed because I was hot, and because those before me didn’t do anything to me.

9
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,420
I undressed because my mother didn’t do anything and didn’t say anything to me.

10
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,999
I undressed.

11
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:17,758
I lay down because I was sleepy and ended up falling asleep.

12
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:27,908
It turned out that I wouldn’t know that I had gotten married for a long time, until eventually we arrived back home.

13
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:41,188
It turned out, they said, that that man purposely wanted us to go before him to make me respectfully withdrawn.

14
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:46,458
That’s how I found out.

15
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:53,867
I lived without knowing that I had a husband.

16
00:01:53,882 --> 00:02:02,611
You see, during the fall, when the people of Chefornak over there where I grew up used to use hookless lures when dipnetting.

17
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:04,519
Were you born there?

18
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:09,053
I wasn’t born in Chefornak.

19
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:16,619
They said that I was born in the spring in Isrimiut, a spring camp, in May.

20
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:24,175
And they said that near evening, there was someone who found eggs when I was born then.

21
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:29,340
How far is Isrimiu? Isrimiut, which direction from Chefornak?

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,720
Toward the water down in the mountains. Haven’t you seen the mountains? (I see them.)

23
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:42,040
Toward the water from the mountains. Toward the water from the mountains across from Kipnuk.

24
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:44,371
Was that a village or a winter camp?

25
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:51,958
They were a big village. There were a lot of houses with sod for their spring camps.

26
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:59,196
And toward here, Nuuteqerrmiut also had houses, and they had a community house.

27
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:07,476
Over from them was the populated place of Chefornak. There were also a lot of people in Qikertaarmiut.

28
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:17,893
They were close together. And the baying dogs were visible, and people wandering were visible.

29
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:24,857
Oh my, their summer camps were very close together.

30
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:35,624
They said that the place I grew up would set up spring camps on this where they called in Isrimiut, in Isrimiut.

31
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:40,944
Oh my goodness, they were at spring camp.

32
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:46,152
You see, there were a lot of legendary little people around them.

33
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,037
And one with a signaling gaff would appear.

34
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:53,713
And when the one with the signaling gaff was going to reach the village, it would disappear.

35
00:03:53,721 --> 00:04:03,078
And after it disappeared, there would be some amount of sleds going to the water beside them.

36
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:12,216
After they went to the water, those legendary little people would keep ahead of the people from that spring camp settlement.

37
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:15,549
They kept ahead of them.

38
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:30,737
After those sleds went to the water, they would go inland. Their sleds were read, filled full with animals.

39
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:43,180
Then right when evening came, those sleds would go here toward the mountains.

40
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:55,057
In the evening, there would be one with a signaling gaff who was from this spring camp settlement.

41
00:04:55,611 --> 00:05:04,182
Then there was a community house outside of our house here, a huge community house.

42
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:14,391
Our dear grandfather, the one they said was Evnguq’s father, would come and sit up there on the above-ground entrance of the community house

43
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:20,322
He sang to the one withe the signaling gaff who was coming inland toward here.

44
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:29,311
And we girls and boys would embrace him like a nest, embraced and listened to him.

45
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:34,350
Oh my, we even eventually learned his song.

46
00:05:34,663 --> 00:05:41,249
You see, he would sing like this, watching that one with the signaling gaff:

47
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:47,362
"One with the signaling gaff-raya-yarra-ii-ya

48
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:53,707
"Aa-ii-ya [?the many blades of grass]

49
00:05:53,719 --> 00:06:01,434
"Spotted seal-spotted seal-spotted seal-spotted seal, bearded seal-yaa-yarra-ii-ya

50
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:07,208
"Aa-ii-ya [?the many blades of grass."

51
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:12,496
We who listened to him completely learned it.

52
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:21,226
When the one with the signaling gaff arrived, when he stood in front of him with clear intent

53
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:29,672
He stuck his small gaff in the ground, put it here, and told a story.

54
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:35,889
He told the ones who would get [the animals they caught].

55
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:47,826
Oh my, the same number of legendary little people would go to the water in front of them every day.

56
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:54,673
It turned out that they would show beforehand how many there would be.

57
00:06:55,517 --> 00:07:04,474
Oh my, the same number that would go toward the water everyday would go get the animals they had caught.

58
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:13,861
Oh my, in the winter, the ones who were at spring camp would fill the walls of their houses, and excess would go on the floor.

59
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:26,554
The huge walls in there, the walls of their spring camp houses would be filled with animals, and the excess would go on the floor.

60
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,648
Oh my goodness.

61
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:34,439
That’s what the people I was born in time to see back then were like.

62
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:37,260
Hold on, please. This ran out of battery.

63
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:43,953
...my grandchildren’s children, my great-grandchildren.

64
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:59,526
The eldest sister of Pangall’aq’s children, Nura’ar, you know, Qussauyaq, Arnaaquq, Tikaaq

65
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:03,411
Their youngest sibling downriver, Nanugaq.

66
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,715
I see.

67
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:21,236
And Uyangqalria with her five children, pregnant with their sixth downriver.

68
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:26,447
And Miisaq’s three children.

69
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:37,315
And Ciulluk’s one child, what would be their younger siblings being miscarried, coming out undeveloped.

70
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:47,838
There are now five who’ve come out undeveloped, the ones who’d Ciulluk’s child’s younger siblings.

71
00:08:48,817 --> 00:09:00,846
And over in Kwigillingok, Akat’aq’s children are my great-grandchildren.

72
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:05,525
Their oldest sister is here, you see.

73
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:18,891
The next younger one has also married as a daughter-in-law in Chefornak.

74
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:22,983
But she comes to her parents.

75
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,867
The one over there...

76
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:35,271
They were visible long ago during your time.

77
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,192
There were a lot of shamans in my time.

78
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:42,198
Please tell us stories about them.

79
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:48,201
We hear this now: good shamans, and bad shamans.

80
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:54,259
Or however. I might be speaking nonsense. You know them. Please tell stories about them.

81
00:09:54,283 --> 00:10:04,454
Some of them, I noticed that some people on the verge of death would hallucinate seeing those shamans that I observed.

82
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:11,959
And some of the people on the verge of death would hallucinate seeing that shaman.

83
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:20,554
Some on the verge of death would do that, saying that he was going after them.

84
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:23,390
They hallucinated on the verge of death.

85
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:33,789
Even though some, however, were said to be shamans, they would be shamans without every having any word said about them.

86
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:40,003
They would be like ordinary people, with no word said about them.

87
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:44,877
However, there were bad ones among them.

88
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:52,430
Looking at his female cross-cousin, I also caught a shaman, you see.

89
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:57,697
I caught a shaman in my dream.

90
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:09,920
One time, I found myself, let me tell you the story, I found myself in the wilderness, sitting all by myself on the ground.

91
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:17,701
When I heard something, I turned my head this way and saw a door here.

92
00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:27,099
There was a right arm, you see, touching the ground as it approached.

93
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:33,391
I thought, "Oh my goodness, this is not a good things."

94
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:44,185
Then before it reached me since it was a little far, I prayed in my sleep down there.

95
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:56,012
I asked the Lord to help me, and that I knew that I couldn’t think of anything to combat this thing approaching that was going to reach me.

96
00:11:56,016 --> 00:12:03,844
I said I had nothing to combat with the same power, but asked to give me strength.

97
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,685
I asked to be given strength for this situation.

98
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,481
Because I was nervous as it was going to reach me

99
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:36,900
When I was finihsed, I opened my eyes as I was sitting with my legs stretched out to find my huge woman’s knife between my legs.

100
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:43,462
How did that come? Yet I was in the wilderness.

101
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,665
I took it.

102
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:53,814
When I took it, I saw that it was going to reach me here.

103
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:57,839
You see, I turned to face it straight on.

104
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:05,992
When I faced it as it was going to reach me, I knelt here like this.

105
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:11,927
I took the knife with its handle like a [?weapon].

106
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:20,728
After I prayed then, I opened my eyes and didn’t feel like myself, and I felt strong.

107
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:31,936
And so, when this right hand reached here

108
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:37,679
I did this with the knife and set it down.

109
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:46,654
Then it started crunching. I shut my eyes fast as it crunched.

110
00:13:46,663 --> 00:13:51,920
As it was crunching, you see, [the knife] stuck into the ground.

111
00:13:52,426 --> 00:14:01,440
Then something screeched, and it seemed like metal screeching. It withdrew into silence.

112
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:05,745
Oh my, I looked back and the arm was gone.

113
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:14,460
Oh my, I thought to myself, while this knife stuck into the ground all the way to its handle.

114
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:22,716
Oh my, it seemed to [?], but I think I wounded it.

115
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:33,741
When I got up and looked around my, oh my, I saw these hands springing up around me.

116
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:38,111
The ones that sprang up didn’t stay still, but would jump.

117
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:44,281
I chased them and would chop them.

118
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:49,381
Eventually, they stayed still. When they stayed, I chopped them up.

119
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:58,431
I threw these fingers in random directions, threw them in random directions so they wouldn’t be gathered.

120
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:08,906
When I had nothing left to do, I stood up and kept that knife with me.

121
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:15,786
I made my way home over to Kwigillingok. I made my way home.

122
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:29,176
I started to dream about those kinds of things in various ways because of Cegg’aq.

123
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:31,746
Cegg’aq here.

124
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:37,136
Cegg’aq said this to me:

125
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:41,346
"Oh my goodness, you," he was drunk

126
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:45,221
"Hey you, let me heal you."

127
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:54,111
He said that he had healed Ayagina’ar over there, the one who made it this far.

128
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:57,436
"Let me heal you.

129
00:15:57,941 --> 00:16:08,651
"When you wash yourself, when you bathe, if I heal you, you would bathe adding in your bathwater with saltwater from down there."

130
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:16,821
He said that he would add on who should be healed, then heal them

131
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:19,816
Like Ayagina’ar there.

132
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:25,901
Oh my, since my mind didn’t want that

133
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:30,686
I told him that it would be fine if I continued to wash this way.

134
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:37,461
I told him it would be fine if I continued to wash like this. I said I didn’t want to do that.

135
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:45,061
He started making me dream since then, because I didn’t accept his offer.

136
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:50,661
Since then, I stopped dreaming about him.

137
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:55,376
But I would dream about those strange things like that.

138
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:59,516
I made my way home and arrived.

139
00:17:02,441 --> 00:17:09,391
Oh my, I looked around after I cut those hands up

140
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:13,711
At that time, spring was nigh

141
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:20,026
And they had celebrated Christmas. It was long since they’d celebrated Christmas.

142
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:25,381
The ground surface had melted.

143
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:32,391
And these lakes were melting, but their ice hadn’t melted yet.

144
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:38,931
And the area between rivers had started gtetting water.

145
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:44,626
I looked around with the land like that.

146
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:55,486
When I went home and arrived, when I went into our house, I realized that I was sleeping, tried to awake myself and opened my eyes.

147
00:17:55,846 --> 00:18:02,566
When I woke up and their poor father asked what happened to me, I told him.

148
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:10,721
I told him that I had that kind of dream.

149
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:23,171
If my dream was true, I said that I would watch all spring for what nature out there was like.

150
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:28,566
I told him this without reaching the point.

151
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:32,481
Then I kept watch.

152
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:41,251
And a long time ago, did you know that they would set up a lot of tents at the mouth of the Kuigilnguq River?

153
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:47,681
I was only born in time to see Tengmiarsuk and family. I think they were the last ones.

154
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:56,281
On this side of Kuigilnguq, there used to be a multitude of tents far downriver.

155
00:18:56,361 --> 00:19:01,351
There were also a lot of tents here upriver from them.

156
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:07,851
And across from them, there would be a lot of tents.

157
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:14,316
When they used to go downriver en masse to the mouth of Kuigilnguq.

158
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:17,481
Oh my goodness.

159
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,286
That’s what they did.

160
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:29,511
We went downriver and stayed across on the other side. There were a lot of people.

161
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:37,831
And my cousin, [?]’s mother and I were neighbors, back when she was alive and well.

162
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:45,996
As we stayed, you see, they started catching a lot of animals from down [in the ocean].

163
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:55,551
I made "little feet [?]" trying to finish them all, the ringed seal skins I had to make into "little feet."

164
00:19:55,901 --> 00:20:01,191
As we were doing that, you see, a person out there opened the door.

165
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:10,621
We had a black tent, with a white part in the middle to let in light.

166
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,421
That’s what we were like.

167
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:26,311
The person said as he came in behind me, Qayuq’s father when he was alive.

168
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:31,526
Then he said to their namesake, he said to Acill’aq

169
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:35,171
"Cousin, you should go to them across there."

170
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:41,126
He said that he wasn’t going to them because he was having stomach problems.

171
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:46,621
Then I noticed those things.

172
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:52,301
Oh my, he said that Cegg’aq passed away.

173
00:20:52,936 --> 00:21:00,116
Oh my, nothing was wrong with him, nothing was wrong with him at that time.

174
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:04,381
Oh my, I said, "What happened to him?"

175
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:10,676
They said that when we coughed up what he coughed up, he passed away

176
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:15,366
Because he’d started coughing up [blood].

177
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:18,111
Oh my goodness.

178
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:22,291
Then they crossed [the river] together.

179
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:31,141
When they crossed and I didn’t want to work anymore, I dropped what I was working, went out, and look around the land

180
00:21:31,371 --> 00:21:35,641
Remembering what I had dreamt the last winter.

181
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:43,491
That person passed away right at that exact point.

182
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:52,801
And the river down there was getting watery, both sides of the riverbank were getting watery.

183
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:57,661
Oh my, it was exactly what I had dreamt.

184
00:21:58,471 --> 00:22:03,321
Oh my. I was so scared at that time.

185
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:06,442
I was scared.
