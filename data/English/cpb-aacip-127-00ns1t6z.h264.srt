1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Watch me… wait.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Watch me as you [speak].

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Wait.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It seems a little bright.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Or is it good?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It looks bright.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,000
Have started it yet?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,900
Yes, hold on.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now, when you start it, ask me how they started getting ready in the fall for what they would need to use.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,900
Will you be sitting like that?

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes, I will be sitting like this.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now, how did they get ready for the winter like this?

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You mean how people long ago got ready for the fall like this?

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Yes.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Our ancestors back then?

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Yes.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And so, I’m not extremely old

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But I am now 68 years old.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,900
I am from Tuntutuliak.

20
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,000
I have a Yup’ik name, Ackiar, that they called me.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,500
An then when we became Westernized now, they started calling me Nick Lupie.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,900
And so, you just asked how they got ready in the fall

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Or, how they got ready for what they would need to use in the winter.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,500
Now, I’m going to start talking, yes, about things I know and have seen.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Upriver in Kialiq in the fall like this when we were boys

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Upriver at the mouth of Kialiq, they say that that creek is called Qukaqlircaraq.

28
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,000
We used to stay there.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Our caretakers here, however, were not sedentary in the fall like this.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Or, they didn’t travel without working like this either.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,900
These things that are used for the fall

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When they came from fish camps across there in the fall, they would gather wood.

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,900
And they didn’t have boats, only kayaks.

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In the morning in the fall like this, because the tide gets very high

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They would start traveling in the early morning when it was dark.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yet sometimes, a kayak would sometimes come into view from Cingik downriver.

37
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,000
It would be pulling [a cargo of] wood.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:26,900
Those people in the fall like this, when they were going to go to the headwaters of these rivers

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
They would gather those when they were going to go to winter camps.

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Our elders who raised us were not like how we are here.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,900
They would travel rowing with their own arms

42
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Rowing [kayaks] on the water.

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And when it was time, they would start going upriver

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,900
Bringing those pieces of wood with them.

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And they would then load their possessions on top of them.

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Those without boats would relocate using wood.

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,900
And then when they reached the headwaters of those rivers where they would spend the winter, they would bring up those pieces of wood.

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:55,900
They would then prepare the wood, preparing their fish traps that they used to catch fish.

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Those who raised us back then used to struggle.

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They used to prepare that wood to make fish traps, big fish traps.

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,900
Big fish traps were like this. Their openings.

52
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
They were wide, [and] long.

53
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And then they were like this.

54
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
They called those their inner compartments [ilulirpiit].

55
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,900
And they would then make fish traps out of the centers too, inflating them like this.

56
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And they would then put the third over there.

57
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They used to call those old fish traps qamut.

58
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:07,000
This fish traps were not like, you know, blackfish traps.

59
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You know, they were this far apart.

60
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,000
They made them equidistant.

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, they didn’t make those big fish traps haphazardly.

62
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,500
They measured these.

63
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And then they put that split spruce there.

64
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,900
And then after doing this over from it

65
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
They used to make those big fish traps about this far from each other like this.

66
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
When they started working on them like this their hands would become raw.

67
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
These parts made like this were not made with twine.

68
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Instead, they thinly split these pieces of wood.

69
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,500
They made them about this wide, but thin.

70
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,900
They wouldn’t work on those haphazardly either.

71
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Their thicknesses had [set] measurements.

72
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
When they started doing that, their [hands] here would get raw doing this.

73
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:47,000
When they started bleeding, they would wrap these three with hide

74
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
When these got raw.

75
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,500
And these, these would also get raw where they held them.

76
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Our ancestors back then were not like this as we are.

77
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,500
They had possessions, wooden possessions.

78
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,000
They used wood to make possessions, tools.

79
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:32,900
They used it for things, houses, possessions for their houses, and sleds.

80
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,500
They survived using this wood for things.

81
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:59,500
And yet when they started getting set, they would check them every day

82
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And they would wake up early in the morning when the tide goes out after it came in.

83
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They would get up at night, [check on] their fishing tools' stakes, go down, and drive them deeper after picking the ice around them like this.

84
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That is what our caretakers back then were like.

85
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,500
They weren't like how it is now.

86
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,500
And then in the fall when it was time.

87
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,500
Their women would prepare tools that they would use.

88
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The skins of these fish, including king salmon

89
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,900
They called it preparing fish skins for clothes.

90
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,900
They referred to those fish skins as amiriit.

91
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,900
Hold on.

91
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
Now, start again.

92
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
It’s time to start? Okay.

93
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Those things I just talked about like this

94
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:51,500
Men’s work, how men worked to prepare their tools.

95
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
However, these women would [work] separately.

96
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:08,500
And before it froze like this, they would prepare tools and skin boots for their men.

97
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And these fish skins like this, king salmon [skins]

98
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
They would call it neqairiluteng.

99
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,500
That’s what they would do when they prepared fish skins for clothes.

100
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:38,500
Also, they wouldn’t just stop at removing the flesh.

101
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:49,000
When they were finished removing their flesh, they wouldn’t work on them right away.

102
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:00,500
They also used to submerge those fish skins into urine like this.

103
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
They removed the smell of fish.

104
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,500
When they did this, what they called aging urine

105
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:26,500
Their men would urinate into those containers, their original containers.

106
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,500
They called that aging urine.

107
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Those would be very stinky.

108
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
They used to soak fish skins in those.

109
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,500
And after they were soaked, they would then scrape them.

110
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They would scrape them after putting them on boards.

111
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,000
They would then hang them outside to dry.

112
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:12,000
And then when those dried, they would make those into boots for their men.

113
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,500
They called that making them fish skin [clothes] that they would use to travel like this.

114
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,500
Their men would also prepare.

115
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Even those blackfish traps.

116
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
When stopped using what they called big fish traps

117
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:52,500
When they were going to change those for blackfish too, they would also make those fish traps.

118
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,900
And then when they kept them set

119
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:17,000
These days, we use various things, boxes and sacks to put blackfish in.

120
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:26,900
However, those who raised us back then that I observed didn’t have those.

121
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:40,500
Their women also used to prepare grass to put them in.

122
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Like this, yes, when they’re not green anymore, when they’re getting pale

123
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
They would gather a lot like this.

124
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And in the summer like this...

125
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,000
I forgot something.

126
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,500
Women would prepare that grass, coarse grass, for their things.

127
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,500
They would be used for weaving.

128
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:28,900
Those who raised us back then always kept the future in mind.

129
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They always prepared what they would need in the future even if it was a long way off

130
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,900
Because they didn’t have anything [pre-made].

131
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,500
They only had what [was made from] the land.

132
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,500
They would [work] because they couldn’t afford not to.

133
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
When the need for it was approaching, they would prepare them a long time beforehand.

134
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
They also used to use tall cottongrass from the summer for weaving.

135
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:22,500
When women started gathering those tall cottongrass, they would spread them to dry, nalacirluki as they called it.

136
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And then when those had dried, nalaluteng as they say,

137
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,000
They wouldn’t gather them either, [but] weave them.

138
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,900
And then when they finished them, they would roll them up.

139
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,500
That’s what they used to do with grass that they used for weaving.

140
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
These days, when I think about those people back then

141
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,000
I’ve started becoming daunted about leading that kind of life.

142
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And then when the men [worked on] their tools.

143
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They would make mink traps that looked like fish traps.

144
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,000
They made them small, about this long, and something like this.

145
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,000
They would make traps depending on the creeks.

146
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,500
Those weren’t made haphazardly either. They also had [set] measurements.

147
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,500
Their inner compartments were not like blackfish traps either. They would be like this.

148
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And then that part over there would be like a den.

149
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,500
When I watched my older sister’s husband like this

150
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:19,000
He would do this with his hands to measure the entrance

151
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,900
Doing that to what they called the throat.

152
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That’s what they were like. They weren’t haphazard.

153
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,000
And then when he made otter traps like fish traps

154
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,500
Their entrances would be like this as before.

155
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:50,000
And then he would do this, measuring it with his thumb, determining the width like this.

156
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Like that. Yes, they apparently didn’t make those haphazardly either.

157
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:09,000
These days, when I think about them back then

158
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,600
I wonder how their lives were.

159
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,000
When I think of them, I would be daunted [by their lives].

160
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But because I [was born] when they started becoming Westernized

161
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,900
Our caretakers occasionally had Western things

162
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,500
But they didn’t get a lot.

163
00:20:47,000 --> 00:21:00,000
They would get tea, flour, sugar, and pilot bread once in a blue moon.

164
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And yet those things that they got

165
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:15,900
They would smell very strong when they were brought in.

166
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And they don’t [seem to] have any scent these days.

167
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:31,000
When they took out the pilot bread, they smell strong from afar, they smelled nice and delicious.

168
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,900
These days, I can’t [smell] them anymore.

169
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Once in a while, though, I smell them when they’re close.

170
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,500
That’s what those people back then were like.

171
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So, how about, you know, admonishments when the men, you know, when they traveled in the fall like this?

172
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:16,000
And so, yes, they used to admonish them like this when it was dangerous as they traveled.

173
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
They also used to tell them not to make a lot of noise in the wilderness.

174
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,900
They said not to make a lot of noise like this.

175
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Only those who get into accidents

176
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,500
They must make noise if they have an fall into the water.

177
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They also admonished us against yelling in the wilderness in the fall like this.

178
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
They told us not to make a lot of noise.

179
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,500
They said that only those in dire situations would make noise like that.

180
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:16,500
And then if they heard anyone screaming, making noise, they would understand that [s]he’s gotten into an accident or fell into water.

181
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yet because they are not admonished anymore these days, they don’t know [those] anymore because we don’t admonish youpl.

182
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
They also make noise like this.

183
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
They yell in between villages here.

184
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
They used to admonish against those.

185
00:23:51,500 --> 00:24:01,500
And then, I’ve done that once when I heard someone who got into an accident.

186
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Before it was too long since Tuntutuliak was established as a village

187
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
When we were down in Kelliq, with people inland from us too.

188
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You see this lake toward the water from this house.

189
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:37,000
In the day nearing evening like this, I heard someone screaming inland from us.

190
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,000
I had thought it was the people inland.

191
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It turned out that someone fell into the water down there. [S]he had apparently fell into the water.

192
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
One of the people going down apparently saw the person just as [s]he was going to freeze to death

193
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
When there was no land here like this.

194
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
They had a lot of admonishments back then.

195
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
They used to tell them like this not to make a lot of noise.

196
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,500
And then this was especially important:

197
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:35,000
When they’re going to travel, they would always say that they’re going around that area.

198
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And when they didn’t return, they would know where they had accidents.

199
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:06,500
Yet these days, when they travel like this with these boats, they don’t say anything.

200
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And then when they don’t return, they don’t know what happened to them because they didn’t say anything.

201
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It’s because they’ve started traveling without consideration these days.

202
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Or they pretend to go somewhere then travel to other villages.

203
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:40,000
That’s what’s making us so addled these days.

204
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:54,000
They have no idea about these descendants like this or they think they’re in some place.

205
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:05,000
These days, even when they die in the wilderness, they have no idea about them.

206
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You see, because there are now a lot of things bringing struggles these days

207
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
People back then were not like this, like this.

208
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,000
They always observed everything.

209
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:43,700
And in the fall, they would always talk to us boys like this

210
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,500
About our futures, what’s in store for us, that they are experiencing.

211
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
They would indicate what was dangerous, in the wilderness too.

212
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,000
These things on land, elevated hills, had names.

213
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,000
All of the creeks had names too.

214
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,800
Some of the lakes had names too.

215
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:22,000
They knew the layout of this land.

216
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:32,000
Yet these days, because we don’t point those out to our children

217
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:44,000
They don’t know the wilderness or what’s on it, rivers, and lakes, and these elevated areas.

218
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:59,000
And when something happens, when we ask them where it happened to them

219
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,500
Or a person these days would get lost, they get lost.

220
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:23,500
When they ask the people who saw it about the area where they saw it they don’t know its name either.

221
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:32,500
They would say it happened over there because we don’t point those out to them anymore.

222
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,500
We used to talk about everything, but we didn’t always experience them.

223
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,500
But when we reached them, we would recognize them.

224
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yes, a person should live through traditional wisdom.

225
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:04,000
Yes, [s]he evidently will not live well if [s]he does not adhere to traditional wisdom.

226
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,500
[S]he will also lack what their peers work on.

227
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
They used to tell us this back then:

228
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:25,000
If we adhere to this traditional wisdom, obey it while we live we will live well.

229
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,500
We should not be lazy or sleep too much.

230
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500
They would promise us that.

231
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:49,500
However, yes, we wouldn’t reach what they indicated yet.

232
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,500
But when we reach it these days, we recognize it.

233
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,500
That’s why they used to tell us this back then:

234
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:12,500
They said to pay attention to our instructor yes, we should watch his mouth.

235
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:22,000
They said that if we look away from him, [we] won’t know what he’s talking about anymore.
