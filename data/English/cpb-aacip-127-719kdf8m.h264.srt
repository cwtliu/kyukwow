1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,870
There were teachers and preachers, and a lot of people. There were a lot of people. There were also a lot of storekeepers.

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,990
There were a lot of Caucasians.

3
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:14,435
Though it was populated by Yupiit, there were a lot of people.

4
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:15,665
What’s going on?

5
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:18,595
Buzzing paper from the wind.

6
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:22,105
Okay, anytime.

7
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:23,448
Okay.

8
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:37,893
Long ago when you first moved here to Bethel, what did you observe? What was this land like?

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:45,250
When we first came, the area toward the water down there was a river.

10
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:51,866
And toward the water from us, the bank here was good, and had willows.

11
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:55,274
We would play under the bank.

12
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:59,446
Because I was cowardly, I wouldn’t go far.

13
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:04,488
The land was good, and there were not a lot of people.

14
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:06,409
Were they mostly Yup’ik?

15
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:11,846
They were mostly Yup’ik with Caucasians among them. There were a lot of Caucasians.

16
00:01:12,812 --> 00:01:22,342
Teachers, priests, and storekeeps, and these miners from mining camps and fishing.

17
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:29,711
Back then, [were there] these mud houses here in Bethel?

18
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:35,677
There was a mud community house, a mud community house.

19
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:38,332
The huge community house was big.

20
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:42,871
From you, right when they started living in houses...

21
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:47,322
They had houses, log houses.

22
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:57,605
And these missions were the only ones with lumber houses, and some of these people also had lumber houses.

23
00:01:57,614 --> 00:02:02,504
However, some of them also had log houses. There were a lot.

24
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:06,658
[I didn’t] see a mud house, except for that community house.

25
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:17,595
When you made your own living back then, starting to subsist

26
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:29,516
Tell us about that, you know, how sedentary people and and active people don’t have enough (Yes.) and don’t lack things.

27
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:35,583
In my earlies memories long ago, people focused on food.

28
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,300
They’d persistently fish.

29
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:45,011
And they’d dry their roe, and dry their heads.

30
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:50,408
Because they didn’t have extremely long drift nets like today.

31
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:55,393
Because their drift nets were short, and they’d always row [when traveling].

32
00:02:56,084 --> 00:03:00,934
I didn’t see anyone surpassing that life.

33
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:08,295
They would row to go drift net, and their boats weren’t big because they were meant for rowing.

34
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:10,913
And their nets weren’t long.

35
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:15,186
They would make great effort to conserve fish.

36
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:23,139
Starting from rainbow smelt, they use dipnets for rainbow smelt, thread them through [grass ropes], hang them, and smoke them.

37
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,209
They were food for dogs, and they’d, we’d eat them too.

38
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:33,671
They steadily worked on things.

39
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:42,465
Now, and in the past, was fish strewn about in the past or what?

40
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:52,377
How they’re strew about, with fish getting strewn about, is it somehow getting harder to find? [Please talk about] that too.

41
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:56,444
They didn’t make a mess fish when I first became observant.

42
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:59,926
They cared for them with great reverence.

43
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:05,847
They wouldn’t scatter or tread upon food scraps.

44
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:07,827
They admonished against that.

45
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:14,546
They told them not to tread upong things, and [all] kinds of birds, anything they ate.

46
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:18,733
They took care of them with great reverence.

47
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:25,739
And they tended to the fish, and when they’d been smoked, they stored them.

48
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:31,705
They stored them, not left them in random places.

49
00:04:31,714 --> 00:04:37,584
What meaning did they give when telling you to revere fish?

50
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:44,173
They say that when they don’t revere them, things, fish, get scarce.

51
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,610
They said they become scarce.

52
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:50,477
That’s what I used to hear.

53
00:04:50,622 --> 00:05:01,062
In your observation of our days now, we see food scraps out there.

54
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:08,511
It’s unfortunate that they’re not taking care of them anymore, because they [?don’t make them] anymore.

55
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:16,013
From the stores, and since money that is coming aren’t for things, there are now a lot of gifts.

56
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:21,226
Back then, though we may have been orphans, we didn’t know of gifts.

57
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:28,996
Without having gifts to take care of us, our mother steadily worked to take care of us through her work with her hands.

58
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:36,196
So, what would they instruct to the orphans?

59
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:44,246
Orphans, a person, people would take pity on orphans.

60
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:49,394
Without looking and ignoring, they helped them, and their families helped them.

61
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,689
That’s what they were like.

62
00:05:51,689 --> 00:06:00,279
Now, a person may be in a situation without food, and peopl won’t know them. They won’t pity them.

63
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:08,845
What about abstinence practices? Did [they] practice abstinence? Did you observe when they did abstinence?

64
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:13,725
Yes. You see, I don’t know abstinence practices.

65
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:15,905
I don’t know abstinence practices.

66
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:22,138
Since my mother didn’t do much abstinence, I don’t know many of them.

67
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:27,965
And because I don’t know them, though it wouldn’t happen, I’d apparently end up doing that.

68
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:36,134
Though they actually wouldn’t, I’d find out later because I don’t know abstinence practices.

69
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:46,496
Now, please tell us of something you think is important, a little piece of traditional wisdom.

70
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:50,558
Well, there are many important things.

71
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:57,457
But I don’t like how people today are no longer a community.

72
00:06:57,597 --> 00:07:06,877
Back when we were going up, our families and relaties, they lived with compassion and love for each other.

73
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:11,806
And when they saw each other, it seemed they were the closest of families.

74
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,520
They are thankful to see each other.

75
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:20,071
And they would give to them from what they could.

76
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,990
Now, they’re absolutely not like that.

77
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:29,287
Though they’re our families and relatives, we hesitate with them.

78
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:33,002
They’re not [loving] like that anymore.

79
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:43,321
I also don’t like when they things from their families though they’re big, boats and motors.

80
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:49,568
In my mind, I don’t like that, also because things are expensive.

81
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:54,565
When people steal those, I think

82
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:59,756
"When they’re going to die," because I think

83
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:05,446
"If I’m going to die, I will remember the wrong things I’ve done."

84
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:11,073
It’s because even if I’m not going to die now, I remember them.

85
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:15,242
I think that those around me might do that.

86
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:25,111
This stealing from one’s family, they also destroy their families’ things.

87
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:28,643
I don’t like that either.

88
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:35,084
It’s bad that it seems they don’t want the families to have anything.

89
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,977
That doesn’t seem good to me.

90
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:51,675
Lastly, what do want to leave behind with the youth, your descendants?

91
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:56,848
What good thing do you want to leave with us?

92
00:08:56,852 --> 00:09:08,412
Becuase these young people have become different and pick on each other, it would be good if they lived treating each other with love.

93
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:13,885
This love that has nothing greater is a traditional instruction.

94
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:21,288
It’s in the Bible that love is the very first and there’s nothing greater than it.

95
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:30,545
I remember that when I want my family to treat each other with love like this, especially the youth.

96
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:35,082
Do not scorn each other, treat each other well and with love.

97
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:42,251
And this [alcohol] they want to abuse, do not, it’s not for anything, and doesn’t improve anything.

98
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:46,712
I don’t want it to be used because it ends in misfortune.

99
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,889
It doesn’t lead to anywhere but misfortune.

100
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:59,549
Though they want to use it in villages, they don’t because it ends badly.

101
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:08,189
In my mind, I want these young people to remember that.

102
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:14,799
Even though we didn’t do it in our youth, even if we were mischievous.

103
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:28,118
But, it’s because we didn’t excessively use somethings, and we respected the things of those around us in our lives.

104
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:31,472
Okay, thank you.

105
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:32,707
You’re welcome.

106
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,061
Okay, goodbye.

107
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:37,106
Oh my, that too...
