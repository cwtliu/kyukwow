1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,110
Ready.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,980
Okay, please answer that how you want.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,010
Please say it again.

4
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:31,249
Okay. Is the anceint Yup’ik wisdom, the ones that have been since ancient times, no different from wisdom of the church?

5
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,340
You know, the ones written in the Bible?

6
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:41,705
Yes. They are no different. We found that in the Bible, they were our traditional wisdom.

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:52,980
And when I was in the church, when I finally went to church, I would recognize the traditional wisdom passed down to me when they spoke.

8
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,250
I would recognize the traditional wisdom passed down to me.

9
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:08,955
How would the women be instructed before taking husbands?

10
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:14,145
Oh my, the men were scary to us.

11
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:17,815
The men were scary.

12
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,960
And we wouldn’t play with each other informally, and we wouldn’t see anyone holding hands.

13
00:01:26,115 --> 00:01:29,405
Long ago, men were very scary.

14
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:32,235
I was scared of them.

15
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:39,285
And I would hear about how I would get pregnant from my mother.

16
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:48,375
And we would take husbands whom we never expected, those we did not expect at all.

17
00:01:55,335 --> 00:02:00,635
What wouold they say about becoming a woman with first mensturations?

18
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:07,240
And for first menstruations, they would have us abstain.

19
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:18,320
When we became women, the men feared us a lot.

20
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:22,805
They say that a woman leads to death.

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,810
I would be scared. And they would tell us that we would make men crazed for women.

22
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,380
Now, they don’t get woman-crazed.

23
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:49,755
They said that they would have girls with their first menstruations abstain for ten days.

24
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,795
They called it aqumgaluteng.

25
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:55,155
Did you not go through that?

26
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,970
I went through it.

27
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:06,035
I abstained, and they had me put on certain clothes.

28
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:14,395
And they wouldn’t have me look around the area. I wouldn’t look around the area.

29
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:17,175
I may have looked around sometimes.

30
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:24,635
(Were there admonishments?) Were were admonished.

31
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:32,675
And when we stood up, they would have us replace what we were sitting on. They would have us raise our hands.

32
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,690
They would warn us about water.

33
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,660
During this time, I had my first menstruations.

34
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,800
(Why did they admonish against water?) They say can see you better at this time.

35
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,850
And raw meat.

36
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,085
And you couldn’t look around?

37
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,350
Yes, they told us not to look around the area. (Why?)

38
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,600
I don’t know. They probably told us our eyesight would go early.

39
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:25,450
And when you were going to cross paths with these boys?

40
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,760
Yes, they would do that.

41
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:30,505
What would they tell them to do?

42
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:38,030
You know, downwind from them. They tell them to pass in some direction.

43
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:41,315
Why?

44
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,390
I don’t know, something about them.

45
00:04:48,436 --> 00:05:08,329
And then, back when people who weren’t from the same village saw others, would they recognize where they were from by what they wore?

46
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:17,167
They said they had decorations like that, including their parkas.

47
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:24,508
People from a certain area had unique decorations.

48
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:29,047
What kind of decorations did you have?

49
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,909
I don’t know.

50
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:40,944
Did these...

51
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:55,724
There are stories somewhere about these orphans.

52
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:07,834
We hear that as the Caucasians were coming, as they were coming somewhere, that they found a, um, sandbar...

53
00:06:08,294 --> 00:06:09,694
A qau͡gyaq?

54
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:19,373
And orphan that people abandoned on an island...

55
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:26,019
That’s not how it... (Yes, on a sandbar.) On a small island, I guess so, but it was on a sandbar.

56
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:30,358
Would people discriminate against those orphans?

57
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:36,243
They had strong adminishments about orphans. They had admonishments about them.

58
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:47,731
They would admonish us that even if others picked on orphans, never to join them.

59
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:51,002
Why so?

60
00:06:51,716 --> 00:07:02,627
Well, they had admonishments about orphans.

61
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:13,241
And they would admonish us that even if they, you know, made fun of people that looked funny, never to join them.

62
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:19,146
Who would take care of the orphans?

63
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:35,264
Back when they wouldn’t get checks, a woman would take care of the dear orphan, but I think their relatives would take them in.

64
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:41,171
I think they took them in when they lost their fathers.

65
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:53,026
And then, you probably had a small doll.

66
00:07:53,050 --> 00:08:02,294
I was never without a small doll. Caikaq and I would always play with small dolls.

67
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:08,053
And so, did your small dolls

68
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:15,578
Did you have different toys for the winter or the summer?

69
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:18,813
Yes, there were storyknives in the winter.

70
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:27,787
We would always tell storyknife stories. Now, we don’t see anyone telling storyknife stories, and don’t see anyone playing with small dolls.

71
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,325
What are inuguat (small dolls), and irniaruat (dolls)?

72
00:08:33,352 --> 00:08:41,374
When different things, birds, came, they would take out small dolls and dolls.

73
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,555
Why?

74
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:49,123
They didn’t take them out in the winter, but kept them stored.

75
00:08:49,142 --> 00:09:00,708
And then when the birds came, probably the jaegers, they would take out the small dolls and the dolls.

76
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:05,393
Why so?

77
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,353
I don’t know. Because they revered nature.

78
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:21,171
I also hear about people jiggin down in Bethel.

79
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:26,141
They say they would catch fish, then the fish would disappear.

80
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:35,308
Some say, "They probably disappeared because a girl within the first year of her menstruations or one who miscarried is jigging." Is that true?

81
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:37,749
That’s probably true.

82
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,595
Were there others like that...

83
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:47,464
When I observed them, I found that they would say that as an admonishment.

84
00:09:55,914 --> 00:10:14,307
And then, back before there were a lot of Caucasians, I don’t think young children had names.

85
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:28,646
I used to hear this: when they would ask him what his name was, he would answer, "I am this person’s child," or "I am this person’s adopted child."

86
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:30,786
Did you hear about that?

87
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:38,200
I used to hear that. They probably didn’t have English names, only Yup’ik ones.

88
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:42,560
So how would they get names?

89
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:50,559
They probably named them. We name them now.

90
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:58,608
No, you know how they bring them to the church, and baptize them with names?

91
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:06,331
How did they name them before there were churches, when Yupiit lived traditional lives?

92
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:11,947
They would give them Yup’ik names.

93
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:20,530
Downriver in Qinaq, we only had a mission church.

94
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:29,101
It was our only church when it was built.

95
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:36,987
When I grew up, I found that there was no church, but a mission house.

96
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:41,656
They would hold services there, and hold services in the community house.

97
00:11:45,593 --> 00:11:50,615
And then they built the old one.

98
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,210
It was their only church.

99
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:16,242
And long ago, these people probably always shared their food with each other.

100
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:24,421
They shared their food with each other as if they were a single family.

101
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:37,299
These days, these young people are started to forget how to speak their Yup’ik langauge.

102
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:45,249
Also, they don’t hear about traditional Yup’ik wisdom anymore.

103
00:12:47,513 --> 00:13:00,124
As they call it, Westernization will spread among Yupiit who don’t speak Yup’ik or who forget who they are.

104
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:14,709
Will we Yupiit be as if we were scattered someday if we don’t speak Yup’ik anymore, or if we don’t hear about those ancient Yup’ik things?

105
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:17,367
We probably will.

106
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:24,029
We shouldn’t lose this language.

107
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,127
Why so?

108
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:33,421
It’s an ancient language.

109
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:49,630
I’d kin dof like to get Nicholai to say something in...

110
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:54,551
Please ask Nicholai a question.

111
00:13:56,239 --> 00:14:10,206
Ask him if he want’s to say any ancient traditional wisdom that young people should follow.

112
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:13,067
What was it again?

113
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:23,269
Okay, as him like this: does he want to say anything that young people should follow in these days?

114
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:32,121
He asked you to speak about ancient traditional wisdom concerning young people.

115
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:51,111
Back when I was a boy

116
00:14:53,163 --> 00:15:06,780
Down in that house, there was an old man, not young, in that house.

117
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:17,996
He would gather the boys there like this in the evening.

118
00:15:19,594 --> 00:15:23,044
We would go in.

119
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:43,991
I still remember to this day one of the things that old man said, and it doesn’t get old.

120
00:15:47,655 --> 00:16:03,355
Back then, it turned out that that man would tell us to be careful in our lives.

121
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:13,160
Also, to treat those around us with love.

122
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:27,447
It turned out that the saying to treat everyone with love was to be followed by every person.

123
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:39,034
And even if he sees him for the first time, he wants to be spoken to and socialized with.

124
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:46,470
That man would speak about this.

125
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:58,652
But what he said one day

126
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:17,890
That old man also told us people who eat food to try not to run out, that we should subsist as we live if we are well.

127
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:29,981
It turned out that being without food is bad for those who eat.

128
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:48,301
The poor people couldn’t afford to waste food because they didn’t have these Western nets.

129
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:59,156
However, he said that some would have nets made by knot-like tying.

130
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:06,439
That’s how that man, old man, would speak of them.

131
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:24,364
Those, they couldn’t afford to waste those tools.

132
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:37,301
That’s why they would sometimes, as they say, starve with a shortage of food.

133
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:47,690
They said the ice broke up. They told me to tell Wifey that the ice broke up. (It broke up.)

134
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:52,788
Well, we have no more tape. Thank you very much.

135
00:18:52,973 --> 00:18:55,756
You spoke more.

136
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:57,604
Thank you.

137
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:00,445
Thank you.

138
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:01,270
You’re welcome.

139
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:05,086
And her mother...
