1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,086
So, before we had cake mix we had mixed eggs to it. 

2
00:00:08,086 --> 00:00:08,504


3
00:00:08,504 --> 00:00:18,150
Aanaq (granddaughter) aqumniartuq.

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,961
I'll add more water again so it can be ready.  

5
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:33,210
Are salmon berry named from salmon due to color?

6
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:36,152
Or, because they are the same? 

7
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:38,697
I don't know.

8
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:46,847
I do know of blueberry.  Like the eyes of cranes?

9
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:56,878
I don't know why berries are berries.  

10
00:00:57,638 --> 00:01:04,200
Like a blue berry, two blue berries.  

11
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:13,301
Or, did they name them salmon berry because of the summer salmon fish.  Salmon berries ... maybe.  

12
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:22,787
They grow just at the beginning of fall.  

13
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:45,576
We don't make these fried bread regularly.  Only once in a while.  

14
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:54,946
Yes, we usually made it in the morning after staying up all night at Nalqigliq

15
00:01:55,086 --> 00:02:03,065
Early in the am I went home and made it.  You know, for my mom and dad's breakfast.  

16
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:12,224
I'd think... I was up all night I want to contribute, thinking of paying back.  

17
00:02:12,474 --> 00:02:21,793
I wanted them to be grateful and so I went home and made fried bread.  And, Carrie would do the same, make fried bread next door to us.  

18
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:38,737
When you stayed up all night what did you do?  When I think of the nights we stayed up, we didn't do anything mischievious but we were pretty quiet.  

19
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:44,010
Next to tents, we tried our best not to make any noise at all. 

20
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:53,119
But, over yonder inside the trees we had a play ground on a clearing..clearing an area. 

21
00:02:53,619 --> 00:03:04,029
We played there at night.  And there was Maklaali who would play some music.  

22
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:09,884
That father of his had good singers. You know, they held a big party.

23
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:14,916
From Nalqigliq three of us went along as girls.  

24
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:21,036
We went with Samil.  Sam Mili, that one.  His boat was a sail boat.

25
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:25,278
You know they used sailboat to travel back then.  

26
00:03:25,428 --> 00:03:28,420
So, that's where we modern danced.

27
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:32,621
And, we joined them.

28
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:45,952
When we went back to Nalqigliq, we did the same at night with him as our singer and danced (saatis style) at night.  

29
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:50,300
We did that seems like.  

30
00:03:50,781 --> 00:04:09,181
That's how you always had to do it.  I heat my oil, too I will use.  

31
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:32,640
So, now you're making a video of me.  Yes

32
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:52,890
So, back in the day...they used rendered animal oil to make fried bread.  I wonder how...and rendered animal oil is strong.

33
00:04:53,342 --> 00:05:02,950
Now, I only use wesson oil.  So, I don't use other than wesson oil...if I don't have wesson oil, I use shortening. 

34
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:11,664
But back then, rendered oil.  Tundra people, back there...(plane noise)

35
00:05:28,138 --> 00:05:47,009
I forget that that there is no TV news.  Yes...When we lived here we always had TV news every day.  It's different now with radio only.  

36
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:18,802
Will you have tea?  Yes, what is in this?  Well water?  

37
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:36,452
Marie was making jam yesterday when we called her. 

38
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:42,119
I wonder what kind of jam she's making.  Probably blue berries. 

39
00:06:54,601 --> 00:07:05,343
His fishing helper isn't working out.  And, he had a court summons.  

40
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:16,495
But, Raba just told me he is staying with them.  She has a place across from it.  

41
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:27,956
Penggartuten-qaa? (at camera guy). He is the only guy here, so maybe that's why he's hot.

42
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:54,233
It's hard to sleep.  Oh, too hot?  Yes (incomplete sentence due to editing).

43
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:16,246
Do they pick cranberries here?  I do not know.  Maybe they haven't.  Or, I don't know.  

44
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:26,385
Over on the other side at Manokotak they make cranberry after cooking them.  

45
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:37,630
Are they not quite rip or when they're ripe?  When they're ripe.  They call them cooked berry.  Yes

46
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:49,032
My mom when she lived there use to make cooked berry. 

47
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:55,645
Why are berries over there....

48
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,519
I thought you were going to do that.

49
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:33,412
This might burn.  They burn easily.  

50
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:41,699
Murilkelluku una.  Cukaluteng uulartut. 

51
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:30,450
We use to say our parents were pretty elisngaq.  And just like this they ate fresh fried bread with their hot coffee/tea in the morning.  

52
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:45,145
Just finished right before.  And before they have tea in the afternoon they make another batch of  fried bread.

53
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:55,018
So, I saw fresh was best, and they ate fresh all the time. 

54
00:11:41,388 --> 00:12:04,952
Having no place to get them.  But those out there, and my next door neighbor does fish.  If I ask for some he may give me some.  My white caucausian neighbors care about me.

55
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:26,987
And that one out there, Shorty planted grass seed on my lawn.  But, Sue's husband when he was here added mud and a shop. He sold it.  

56
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:54,499
It ruined it outside with sand piled up here and there, any which way.  And, Shorty is not even planting seed for grass anymore.  He use to cut the grass all the time, always including me.  That's why I like him.  

57
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:26,150
He works very hard.  He works all the time.  I know he will work on his flowers when he gets home even though he's dirty.  I tease him sometimes.  That man, he really doesn't know what rest is.  Always working.  

58
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:51,808
Do those apartments have people staying in them?  Yes.  They're always occupied. In the day I think they work.  They must be expensive.  Yes, they are expensive, $800 down is what someone said. And, there are people in them all the time.   

59
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:12,646
Ana, ah, lets just use tea bags.  

60
00:14:26,378 --> 00:15:04,496
Sugar them up, have some tea.  (Great-granddaughter says, 'naspaayugtua') They are excellent hot.  Can I get a tea cups.  Can I set cups?  yes

61
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:34,870
Get yourself a cup, it boiled.  (question unclear) She (Ana?) is looking for work.  Very good (fried bread just finished). Wages are very low for lower 48.  I found that out last winter.  They have lower wages.  Maybe here, things (incomplete due to editing)
