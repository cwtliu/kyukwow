1
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:23,720
In the fall like this when it first freezes before it gets thick, the ice is dangerous.

2
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:31,130
Also, part of it also freezes late like this.

3
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,740
When it repeatedly warms up, it freezes late, and even when it’s cold, part of it freezes late.

4
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:46,855
Also, when it freezes, it’s dangerously thin.

5
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,220
A person has no means to understand thin and dangerous parts [of ice].

6
00:00:53,405 --> 00:01:04,035
But if he has a walking staff, if he examines that ice with his staff, he will know.

7
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:07,810
Ayagina’ar said that the staff was part of an admonishment.

8
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,750
They told people not to be without them to gauge the ice.

9
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:18,235
My father used to tell me this, including other people:

10
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:27,860
If a one suddenly sinks like this and floats, they said not to go up to land right away.

11
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:30,965
They said to try to keep the ice from closing up.

12
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:39,160
If it closes up and he tries to get out right away, he will become weakened.

13
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,370
Ayagina’ar said this:

14
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:48,970
"If a person has gloves as he falls [through the ice], he should wet his gloves and have them stick to the edge of the ice.

15
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:53,590
"If he does that, he can get out of the water, but he should take his legs out first.

16
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,180
"Then when he gets out..."

17
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:05,840
If he gets out in the cold like this before there is snow, he should take off his clothes right away

18
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:09,295
If the land here is close, and if grass if visible.

19
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:15,565
Wring them out even if it’s cold, undress and take off the wet clothes.

20
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:21,235
Then put them on again, putting a layer of grass against his skin.

21
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:27,445
Then he should make a considered decision if he is getting colder

22
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,110
If he tries to urinate and drinks his own urine

23
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:41,440
His own urine if he’s alone, or if there are two of him, his companion’s urine, if he drinks the urine from one who can urinate

24
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,530
They say a person will not freeze to death if he does that.

25
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,400
Please join us tomorrow.

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,180
Ayagina’ar will instruct us on what a person should do when lost when the [season of] the year is like this.

27
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:22,930
These elders speak about things they’ve experienced.

28
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:34,890
They also speak about things they’ve heard, things they’ve heard their elders back then say, to young people so that they will be heeded correctly, and that they will go through life well.

29
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:41,730
If a person knows these traditional instructions, if these young people adhere to them

30
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,060
Young people, especially today, do not know what they should do.

31
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,590
That’s why their parents should let them know [of those things].

32
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:57,395
Always instruct them, especially in these current dangerous times.

33
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:59,625
As Ayagina’ar said

34
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:07,375
After some river [ice] is thick, they get thin after the weather warms up, making them very dangerous.

35
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:11,525
Let’s also listen to what a person should do when suddenly lost.

36
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:21,915
If one gets lost and the weather gets back, it would be better if he doesn’t continue, but stops right away and stays put.

37
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:25,390
Not staying still, but trying to stay warm in the cold.

38
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:34,470
Not sitting still, trying to stay warm, and not continuing on but stopping [where he is].

39
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:39,575
If he continues on, he will go far and eventually run out of gas.

40
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,330
And those who look for him will not find him right away if he continues on like that.

41
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:56,280
When they start traveling on [frozen] rivers, one who’s going should not forget to take his ice pick, walking staff, tarpaulin, and his shovel.

42
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:05,920
Also, when he’s going to travel, he can tell his family that he’s going to that place, that he’s going somewhere there.

43
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:15,415
If his expected return has passed, the people from his hometown will first go to where he wanted to go.

44
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:49,880
Some angrily reply to whomever did [wrong] to them that they shouldn’t do that

45
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,350
That I shouldn’t live my life doing that.

46
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:05,000
Then if it’s a woman, I should not reply harshly to her if she [?wrongs me]

47
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:11,075
They told me not to reply harshly to her and turn away from her.

48
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:22,395
Then they said that if my age-mate, if my age-mate continually does that to me

49
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:32,060
If one puts my down, and if one says I’m a bad hunter, if he puts me down

50
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:43,255
Or even if he says I have nothing, one may say I’m a bad hunter with nothing, not one single thing

51
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:49,265
They said to only reply if we can’t take him anymore.

52
00:06:49,265 --> 00:06:55,425
My father would instruct me like that, to answer however I want.

53
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:30,760
The people I was born in time to see back then didn’t know about Thanksgiving.

54
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,840
In my earliest memories, I found that there was no Thanksgiving.

55
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:51,262
ONly when there were you know, priests here in Kwigillingok, did they show how to celebrate Thanksgiving.

56
00:07:51,469 --> 00:08:00,019
When one of the priests talked about how it first started, I think it was Didmer

57
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:12,813
He said that those captives from across the ocean, somewhere far away, they crossed the ocean in their captivity.

58
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:20,289
You know, captives don’t live very comfortable lives.

59
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:27,726
They had many hard times, then they crossed that ocean.

60
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:35,732
Only when they had landed safely did they start planting crops.

61
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:42,651
They [harvested] the crops they started planting.

62
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:56,258
Then they started this Thanksgiving tradition here, you know, [in thanks] for God’s care, though they had also been suffereing greatly when they were captives back then.

63
00:08:56,808 --> 00:09:11,196
They started this Thanksgiving tradition especially in thanks for those crops that they grew, that God let grow for food.

64
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:49,209
During Thanksgiving, when they [spoke of] those things, when they brought that up, when they told about it to us

65
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:57,409
To those who now of this Thanksgiving, we must be thankful to God as they were.

66
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:01,753
You know, we must be thankful for everything.

67
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:08,366
I realized afterwards when I thought about it

68
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:17,948
We must be thankful to God for all of the ways that God takes care of us.

69
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:24,160
I have one thing that I’m most thankful for as we’ve reached this Thanksgiving season.

70
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:37,254
Recently in the month of August this past summer, I would be sick before then.

71
00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:41,473
I had back problems.

72
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:51,230
But right when August became, I was more sick than ever before.

73
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:56,243
And my body would gush out sweat, and my hair would be soaked with sweat.

74
00:10:56,825 --> 00:11:03,087
It turned out it was because I had developed stones in my internal organs inside.

75
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:11,563
I would have undoubtedly incapacitated had they not found those in me at the hospital.

76
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:21,494
That is what I’m most thankful for to God during this Thanksgiving season

77
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:32,507
Because even though I was like that, he has allowed me to live to this time, this day.

78
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:04,801
We are now experiencing the traditional wisdom of those elders.

79
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:12,676
In the summer during fishing season like this, they tell us to try to catch fish.

80
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:21,220
Our elders tell us not to sleep too much, but to try to catch fish.

81
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:24,726
They said that the ocean is not dependable.

82
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:31,008
Now, the ocean is showing you how undependable it is.

83
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:39,808
But if it wants to close it off to us, it will close off hunting for us. The ocean will close itself off to us.

84
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:53,008
Also, when I ponder, fish are sometimes scarce in some spring seasons, some summers.

85
00:12:53,539 --> 00:13:01,139
Also  those seals are scarce some spring seasons.

86
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:08,946
Also, those birds would come in small numbers in some spring seasons.

87
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:18,021
They would say that there were none. They wouldn’t tell anyone that there were none.

88
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:23,246
But sometimes, you sees, and some years

89
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:32,703
Those would not be scarce, with lots of fish, and even lots of seals, and even lots of birds.

90
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:41,659
That’s what they were like long ago. They wouldn’t say that there were none left like that.

91
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:18,165
They say that a boy especially moves out when it is time for him.

92
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:24,796
They also said that many, some, many have started doing this now.

93
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:31,722
You know, in villages, boys marry people who are not from the same village.

94
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:35,072
They move to another village as our elders back then called it.

95
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:40,422
Then there’s that important traditional wisdom I used to hear.

96
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:51,397
If a boy moves to another village, we boys, this is what they especially warned us about back then:

97
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:57,191
They said that if we move to another village that is not our own

98
00:14:57,735 --> 00:15:05,248
If we move to that village that is not our own where we grew up, we should live carefully.

99
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:14,135
You know, we should try not to sow discord in this village.

100
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:19,716
You know, this is what they especially admonished against:

101
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:33,747
Do not try to sow discord among those around you, your fellow people who go through life with you, there where it’s not your home village.

102
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:43,598
Watch, they said, if you do not heed that, if you sow discord where it’s not your home village

103
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:47,273
That village will wonder about your parents.

104
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:57,199
"How, has he not been instructed by his parents when he was a boy?"

105
00:15:57,211 --> 00:16:06,786
They said they will especially say that without my knowledge if I sow discord where it’s not my home village.

106
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:40,667
And though I want to tell them about that traditional wisdom here, I cannot tell them

107
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:48,768
Because they won’t understand Yup’ik like this since they only speak English now.

108
00:16:51,781 --> 00:17:00,943
But it’s better to give them examples or metaphors through these things

109
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:09,694
Not excessively naming them or whatever.

110
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:15,632
Their minds are negatively affected when done excessively.

111
00:17:49,463 --> 00:18:00,788
Those elders who share wisdom about the future, if these two are not known anymore, they can be replaced

112
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:07,219
Those who provide wisdom for the future to these boys.

113
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:19,707
But these girls who help out in their houses, their grandmothers work with them instead.

114
00:18:19,714 --> 00:18:26,801
Their wisdom is one and the same with those two [old men] when I look closely.

115
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:39,551
And though this wasn’t my grandmother, when my maternal aunt instructed my older sisters

116
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:46,195
Being almost exactly the same, in conjuction, her traditional wisdom was the same.

117
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:54,089
Their admonishments are one and the same. Their instructions are also one and the same.

118
00:18:54,614 --> 00:19:00,177
You wouldn’t hear any surprising [different] traditional wisdom.

119
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:44,852
We didn’t have children like this a long time ago where things were readily available.

120
00:25:44,864 --> 00:25:50,764
We didn’t do things like how they do it now.

121
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:59,821
Instead, we took care of children as our instructors told us to.

122
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:05,859
We forsook sleep; we didn’t indulge in sleep.

123
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:14,940
Then as we were told, we would only breastfeed them ourselves, only breastfeed them

124
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:19,496
As we were admonished against nursing them with Western bottles.

125
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:30,696
Then as we were instructed to forsake sleep to take care of them by our grandmothers, or our maternal aunts

126
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:39,015
When we slept at night, you know that children’s diapers need to be changed now.

127
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:42,553
But we didn’t do that in our time.

128
00:26:42,572 --> 00:26:48,909
As they told us to forsake sleep

129
00:26:48,922 --> 00:26:59,934
Right after we slept for a short time and turned to them, when they hadn’t urinated, we would let them urinate or defecate into their little waste containers.

130
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:04,810
We didn’t have an easy time with diapers.

131
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:13,660
Then, you see, those who are taken care of like that know how they are taken care of though they are very small

132
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,835
Because they’re conscious form the start though they’re small children.

133
00:27:34,273 --> 00:27:40,898
They said not to raise your hand against them or shout at them when you raise them.

134
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:47,504
They especially said not to shout at boys, saying this:

135
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:56,323
"Should they reach the time when they start hunting, if they start to subsist by themselves in the wilderness

136
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:01,642
"If they see an animal to hunt that their minds wil be afraid of

137
00:28:01,655 --> 00:28:06,055
"They might thoughtlessly flee the wong way

138
00:28:06,074 --> 00:28:13,349
"Or they may thoughtlessly try to chase that animal the wrong way."

139
00:28:13,355 --> 00:28:27,680
For that reason, we were admonished against raising children by shouting at them, shouting at our children, or physically grabbing and hitting them.

140
00:28:51,836 --> 00:28:58,386
There are also separate pieces of traditional wisdom for raising little girls.

141
00:28:58,393 --> 00:29:05,680
It’s like what I just said, not to shout or raise your hand against them.

142
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:12,355
But they said that because they will be helpers, since they will help those of us who are mothers

143
00:29:12,368 --> 00:29:16,668
We must raise them without shouting at them.

144
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:28,412
And they said that from the start, have them watch how things are done, what women do, have them be conscious of them.

145
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:35,168
But it’s detrimental in these days [that they’re] going to these schools.

146
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:44,037
In my observation, my close observation, when they go to school, their behavior changes.

147
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:49,306
And they start becoming less and less obedient.

148
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,632
Eventually, some become unmanageable.

149
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:26,519
Though some suddenly lose their mothers or become orphans

150
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:32,720
They uphold what their mother did, and make it shown.

151
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:40,145
They even strive do to things well, and they do not let their food become dirty.

152
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:46,933
That was what we were told, what we were always told.

153
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:57,489
They always ended it with the important fact that we would have no food someday if we don’t take good care of food.

154
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:07,496
They also said not to always be without food, for subsisting fathers to take care of those who are mothers.

155
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:14,534
They told them to always take good care of them, and always make them into edible food.
