1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:11,010
Were we not sad over our loss, we wouldn’t have killed that animal that ate.

2
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:15,355
Afterwards, the people ate the rest of it.

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,390
Way in the...

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:28,600
We also ate what had been eaten. We ate it because we had nothing else to eat.

5
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,830
There’s a lot of places to hunt up there in the mountains.

6
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:45,135
Here’s the first: Evsairniit is a place to hunt.

7
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:55,000
And the next: a hunting place is going up from Nacarkarniar.

8
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,930
And the third: Ilutuqacuk, my lands.

9
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,190
(And from Kangerpakmailiat.) Yes.

10
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,310
Then Naqerpak. Then Nurtuutaraq.

11
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:15,815
Lots of camps [?] upriver.

12
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:18,285
Then Qanirtuum Qagatii.

13
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:21,675
Way of up there, [?].

14
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:33,665
They call it Naqerpak where it goes it goes here to Kuinerram Qagatii.

15
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:44,385
And on this side of Kuinerram Qagatii, inland from the lake, Equgniilnguut is also hunting grounds.

16
00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:52,325
And then downriver near its mouth, there’s a hunting ground that they hunt in for a long time.

17
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:59,015
And then every single man from Kuiggluk goes there in the fall.

18
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,870
They would only return when Christmas was nigh.

19
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:20,030
And up there where they call it Naqailnguq is also a hunting ground where they hunt for a long time.

20
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:33,765
I know all of the hunting grounds up there.

21
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,730
It’s called Ingriúrluq. The mountain is called Ingriúrluq.

22
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,770
And downriver, it’s called Elngurtuliar.

23
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
And across from them is Qikertat [Islands].

24
00:02:54,285 --> 00:03:04,725
And these two inland from Elngurtuliar, the upright boulders are called Napanguliik.

25
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:16,050
And beneath them, they call them Ingrilukaak. That is also a hunting ground.

26
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:26,470
And then up there across from it is Iluvagtuq. They call it Iluvagtuq. That’s also a hunting ground.

27
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:37,645
And then upriver and to the side, the moutnain Ulurrugnaq is steep.

28
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,780
It’s slope goes toward the water.

29
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:47,180
And in the center is a grassy area. The grass grows upriver.

30
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:55,870
In the center of those plants, the elders say

31
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,850
They say that a person went up.

32
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:08,840
And then when he reached the middle, he became wary. He was wary and squat down below.

33
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,525
He couldn’t do anything, couldn’t go on.

34
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:19,785
They say that the center of that mountain up there is a grassy area to this day.

35
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:33,595
Then upriver, they call the small mountain Atsartuliar. It’s also a hunting ground.

36
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:46,215
And the the small river inland from that small mountain, the small river going inland is called Kuignayugpak.

37
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,700
Now that is a hunting ground where they hunt for a long time.

38
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:00,410
And then, I’m going to go to the Qanirtuk River.

39
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:12,150
On the banks of the Qanirtuk River... what do they call the mountain again?

40
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:18,515
Ulurrugnaq. That’s also a hunting ground.

41
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,950
And upriver from there... what is it again? Cayagtuli? No.

42
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,650
I don’t know them. Is that all?

43
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:37,675
No, there’s more. There’s a lot more.

44
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:45,955
And then up there is Ircaqurrnaq.

45
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,020
That’s also a hunting ground. It’s called Ircaqurrnaq.

46
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:59,570
And then toward the water, there’s a similar mountain. It’s called Ircaqurrnayagaq.

47
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:12,535
And then over and upriver are Evsiaksugaak. They also hunt not far from there.

48
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,260
And here is Qerrirtaq.

49
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:25,575
Qerrirtaq is also a hunting ground where they can hunt for a long time.

50
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,430
And then upriver is Cingikeggliq.

51
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,970
The mountin with a sharp upward summit is called Cingikeggliq.

52
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:44,700
And on this side, they mountain going down to Kuiggluk is named Canirngalria.

53
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:51,635
And then on the other side is Qupun. It’s called Qupun.

54
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:58,170
And then over at the end, it’s name is Canyon, Kuignayuggaq.

55
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:06,255
And on the other side here is Nacarkarniarun.

56
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:10,495
Now that place where they go up is a hunting ground.

57
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:17,145
And then on the other side of Nacarkarniarun...

58
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,150
[?Don’t use your hand.]

59
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,900
What?

60
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,260
Evsairniik. They call it Evsairniik.

61
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:28,205
They also hunt there for a long time.

62
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:40,800
Yeah, take a break, rest, stop for a mintue. Yeah, stop. (Okay, you can stop.)

63
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,680
I’ve just talked about all of those hunting grounds.

64
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:49,225
I don’t know how to talk in English.

65
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:56,655
Has he mentioned any stories of big creatures?

66
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,690
It has big fish.

67
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:00,985
Yes, he just talked about it. He already did.

68
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:09,920
Did he talk about, anything about the skeleton, ribs, skeletons on the beach?

69
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,260
It’s long time.

70
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,470
Okay, did he talk about that though? (Yes.) The skeletons on the beach? (Yes.) Okay.

71
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:24,005
[?] the father, her father, long time, the bones.

72
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,750
White bones? (Yes, yes.)

73
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:33,340
He get big hole. (Right.) In and out, the kids are playing there.

74
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,530
That’s the story we heard.

75
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:44,150
She said long grass, that’s he’s on ground place, that old place.

76
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:48,015
Do you know which side of the lake those were on? North side?

77
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:51,305
No. (South side?) Kwethluk side.

78
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:52,855
Kwethluk side of the lake?

79
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,365
That’s east side?

80
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:56,585
Yaa.

81
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,740
It faces this side. Yes.

82
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:03,050
Kiillaraliin, Heart Lake, Kwethluk, this side.

83
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,750
This side, that’s where the bones were? (Yes.)

84
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:11,035
Yes, where your map? I’lls how you. Where’s your map?

85
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,680
Okay, George can you get that? It’s back in there, top one.

86
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,560
Toward it on the map, you know it goes like this toward Kwethluk?

87
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:37,955
Right or left? Right?

88
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,010
Where’ Kwethluk again? Here’s Kwethluk.

89
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,320
Yes, it’s this side.

90
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,570
We always stay this side.

91
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,225
There’s Kuikayak over there.

92
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,490
Can you say this aloud?

93
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,970
Here’s Kuikayak.

94
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:58,845
Yes. Crooked Creek Mountain. Yes, here it is.

95
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,955
Where’s Killalin? Here it is.

96
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,455
The river over there... (Here’s Kuigceńaq.)

97
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,660
Upper Fall is Igceńaq, Qurrlurta.

98
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:26,185
(Yes.) Eskimo name, Qurrlurta.

99
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,960
Here’s Taryaqvagtuli.

100
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:39,455
Yes, here it is down there on this side.

101
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,960
It’s on this side. (Yes, it’s there on this side.)

102
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:50,275
Evon Qugg’aq, [?].

103
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,390
You know stories, or?

104
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:00,405
No, it’s older than.

105
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:06,165
She’s teaching for hunting, walking.

106
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:09,935
No stove, just tent in the winter.

107
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:16,555
When you went to Heart, like, did you walk?

108
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,870
No, by plane.

109
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,750
Oh, this time? Long time, a long time ago, though, did you walk?

110
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,900
Dogs. (Dogs.) Dog team.

111
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,660
She went Heart Lake in the winter?

112
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:35,435
Spring. (In the spring for the thaw?) Beaver hunting, that kind.

113
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:44,285
Now it’s, only in the the fall this year.

114
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,960
How many years, that was long time. Her daughter went up there.

115
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:54,205
I think [?] sickness.

116
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,800
They flew up this year?

117
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:13,145
Is the lake, the lake’s good now? There’s no big fish in the lake? It’s good? No...

118
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:19,515
She god lots of talaarit [rainbow trout]. What are talaarit again?

119
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,190
What do they call those fish again?

120
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:30,865
Who? Who?

121
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,000
The trout in lakes.

122
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:36,145
No big... (Citegnat.)

123
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:42,070
Small ones we’re fishing. (Citegnat.) We’re fishing, we’re eating small ones.

124
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:44,925
But no creatures in there like the stories anymore.

125
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:55,185
Sometime, her youngest brother, but way up from the moutnainside, he saw something bubbling the water.

126
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,820
And then he saw lots of spots.

127
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:06,610
Down, way down, it’s clear, you know, the clearest water?

128
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,480
Clear water?

129
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,590
Yes, way down there, he saw the spots, black.

130
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,830
When was that?

131
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,830
Almost jump up.

132
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:18,475
This time? This trip?

133
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,530
No, long time, her brother, when she was...

134
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,540
She’s in hospital now.

135
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:33,045
So did people get scared and stop going there, or people always went there?

136
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,310
But me, I’m scared I might eat airplane.

137
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:47,345
Really, I’m scared. We might eat.

138
00:13:48,195 --> 00:14:00,075
You ever, you or Wassilie ever hear of a stone face on top of a mountain by Kiseralik?

139
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,470
Stone head, face?

140
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,490
No, I never go there, Kiillaraliin.

141
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:13,925
What head?

142
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,300
Stone, rock, on top of a mountain.

143
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,450
I think, no, I don’t know it.

144
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:26,025
Did you know Old Man Reed had a mine up on the Kiseralik?

145
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,150
[?] I always went up, always [?].

146
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:33,195
Only went up to...

147
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,750
One time, he wen tup to Kiillaraliin, but always rain.

148
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:51,375
Some stories we’ve had, the people go up to Kiseralik all the time, but they were afraid to go to Heart Lake, ’cause there’s supposed to be a creature over there. So they never did go to Kiseralik, I mean, to Heart Lake.

149
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,480
We talked to Fanny, Fanny. (Yes.) Yes.

150
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:03,760
When she was young, her brother, David Jackson?

151
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:11,685
Look, I’ll show you Kiillaraliin. Take it.
