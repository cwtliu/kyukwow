1
00:00:00,474 --> 00:00:03,591
I haven’t figured out what they are. (Yes, I have no idea about them.)

2
00:00:03,597 --> 00:00:04,722
Okay.

3
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:10,894
I think we’ve started rolling.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:27,581
William, please tell us where you were born, and how old you are now.

5
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:28,701
Okay.

6
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:37,775
I was born in 1915 long ago when the Kuskokwim here was peaceful

7
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,720
And people rowed like this.

8
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:46,018
And they rowed to fish, with no boat motors.

9
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:52,498
How old are you now from what you think, what you know?

10
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:55,119
I think I’m 75.

11
00:00:56,621 --> 00:01:00,151
(Say your name in Yup’ik too.) Callerkuaq.

12
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,786
(Callerkuaq?) Yes.

13
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:02,554
I see.

14
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:12,707
Please tell us about your first work when you were young too.

15
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:20,015
I was one of the elders in church. I would preach in church.

16
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:26,456
And for the youth, I was the young people leader.

17
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:37,316
And after that, I was in the council, IRA Council, back around ’43.

18
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:44,043
And since then, I never stopped working with [tribal] council laws.

19
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:55,205
I also especially know about the traditional instructions of our way of life among Yupiit.

20
00:01:55,749 --> 00:02:00,369
And these, I was not a student.

21
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:10,126
And the federal government, the Territory of Alaska, I also observed their laws.

22
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:19,769
I would also learn by watching these people who were knowledgeable about laws.

23
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:29,376
These days, this alcohol that is a problem among us Yupiit

24
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:40,015
What it was like in the past, it’s still closed here in Bethel or in villages.

25
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:45,859
Please talk about what it was like, and how it compares to today.

26
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:53,154
In 1930, I heard about [someone drowning in] water in Akacakarralria.

27
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:58,083
And I saw that alcohol got him.

28
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:05,478
Then afterwards, I heard about someone shooting themself under the influence of alcohol.

29
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:10,323
They were far apart. I think it was the year after.

30
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:21,957
And quite some time after that, I also heard about a person who’d gone missing in the spring when the ice broke.

31
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:28,895
And when they found him in the summer, we went downriver to see him.

32
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:32,664
Those are the first ones that alcohol got.

33
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:38,466
Then starting recently from here, it’s become common.

34
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:41,938
These boys are short-lived.

35
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:48,273
And when it was open, they dropped in great numbers.

36
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:55,902
And in our current days, it’s worse than ever.

37
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:07,838
Sometimes, I sleep in fear because these young people are distressing.

38
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:21,636
What instructions can you give us about that, and how we can help those who have that addiction?

39
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:29,362
With those with that problem and addiction, they say the first is love.

40
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:35,917
Also, though they do it a lot, do not find fault in them.

41
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:44,500
Instead, do not treat them any different according to the love of our ancient way of life, our ancestors’ practice.

42
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,870
We evidently cannot love by completely eradicating that.

43
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:56,172
Some think that no one will socialize with them.

44
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:05,730
We must also talk to them about wisdom concerning their lives.

45
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:13,973
Now, when a person with an addiction says this:

46
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,751
"I want to quit. I don’t want to drink anymore."

47
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,779
Sometimes we answer them like this: "I do admonish you. You don’t listen."

48
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:32,124
How would you instruct us to answer that person who has that desire?

49
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:39,557
That one who has that desire must believe in what I said.

50
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:48,959
Sometimes, I see them truly quit that.

51
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:57,112
But now, some of them can’t quit.

52
00:05:57,122 --> 00:06:07,202
I work in the tribal court for alcohol. Sometimes, there are nine boys.

53
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:12,343
But we work on them with our court.

54
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:15,893
I like it.

55
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:22,714
But those little children that are this big

56
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:32,524
I can bring them in altogether without any threat and speak to them as our ancestors used to.

57
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:37,612
Yet these big ones who are 20 years old

58
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:47,007
To me, that one cannot be worked with like those children in that Yup’ik teaching space.

59
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:56,954
But we do not ignore the one that needs it, bring them downriver if we are wary.

60
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:05,411
Now, I can speak about what I know and have experienced.

61
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:15,382
You just said that you tell children or young people about the traditional wisdom that you used to hear.

62
00:07:15,398 --> 00:07:20,510
Please bring forth that traditional wisdom you used to hear.

63
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:30,762
This is what it’s like: "My son, obey your father and mother. Obey them so that you will live."

64
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:37,210
That’s traditional wisdom for [children] who aren’t big.

65
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:48,155
Also tell them this: if they hear something when it’s time to go to bed, to go home right away.

66
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:55,047
They say that after midnight, in our way of life.

67
00:07:55,154 --> 00:08:02,632
They say that when it’s after midnight, a person splits.

68
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:07,116
Something will happen to his mind inside.

69
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:14,974
He will go inside the home and act like he has no chores do to after midnight.

70
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:20,848
That is what our ancestors spoke about.

71
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:28,564
Whatever else that is important that you want to say

72
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:39,082
It may be a traditional instruction, it may be an admonishment, or our traditional ways, the ways of Yupiit long ago

73
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:43,532
Now, say something you want to say.

74
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:53,589
Back in our ancestors’ time, there was nothing but the community house.

75
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:58,398
They would instruct us there in that community house.

76
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:05,244
But when I went into a house, I would stand out there by the door.

77
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:08,718
There would be someone instructing here.

78
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:14,015
These two dear people would speak to me of dear things.

79
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:21,933
And from the [?barriers] out there, we couldn’t step anywhere or go anwere either.

80
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:28,816
Now, I don’t come across people giving instruction anymore.

81
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:35,956
In our current days, I don’t come across those anymore.

82
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,504
Why is it like that?

83
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,934
It’s an ancient practice since a long time ago.

84
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:59,030
Our Yup’ik instructions do not change after over a hundred years, and it does not create unrest.

85
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:06,199
But one can talk about peace. A person can admonish them for peace.

86
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:17,477
Also, small villages would have leaders, one elder who was an instructor.

87
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,561
That person was like a great authority.

88
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:33,097
Every village, I used to see them a long time ago, and downriver in Napaskiak, even this little village that they call Ayalpiit.

89
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,611
You also just said that young people don’t hear traditional wisdom anymore.

90
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,351
That these don’t [hear them] anymore. Why is this so?

91
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:58,624
It’s like that because this state is going to overshadow us.

92
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:01,413
Covering us like this.

93
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:09,533
We started what is called the Yup’ik Nation.

94
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:12,856
I call it the Ancient Way of Life.

95
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:22,669
I can also say that, "Obey your father and mother. And stop following your every inclination as you live."

96
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:30,269
Now, he’s getting strong, getting better to me, downriver in Akiachak.

97
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:33,403
He was almost lost.

98
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:41,291
Then that boy Willie, how close are you in age? You might be the same age as him.

99
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:48,085
Also, our traditional advice and instructions.

100
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:51,981
And those the same age as him, I have a council with his age-mates.

101
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:56,610
My mind doesn’t worry about them now.

102
00:11:56,934 --> 00:12:05,223
But I still haven’t taught them about the stars and the winds, how to survive.

103
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:11,806
Much of how to survive has still not been brought up.

104
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:21,748
You made me curious about survival with the stars and winds. Please [talk about it].

105
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:26,262
I thoroughly know about these four winds.

106
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:28,054
They [concern] fish.

107
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:35,662
I know when fish are coming in the summer through these [winds] because I always went fishing.

108
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,347
And I knew whether they’d be abundant.

109
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,990
One wind [heralds] no fish.

110
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:51,031
They say that the west wind, though you may fish, they won’t bite

111
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:53,614
Those things...

112
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:56,390
You must also observe the stars above.

113
00:12:56,405 --> 00:13:04,171
Up on the middle of the sky, there are seven spinning stars, a clock.

114
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:14,816
If the seven spin like this, when it faces the day over there, when it stops and faces it

115
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:23,674
The star will rise, being the only biggest and brightest. It pulls the Days [?constellation?].

116
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:26,820
And when it arrives, the Days appear.

117
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:31,094
That was when our ancestors started working.

118
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:36,953
They said it’s time. Also because they had no clocks, because they didn’t see clocks.

119
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:45,942
Also, when they [?twinkle] like this, it will be windy. They’re connected to the wind.

120
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:53,060
And though the wind blows from there, if a shooting star goes in the opposite direction, the wind will blow from there.

121
00:13:53,288 --> 00:14:00,421
These are what they call scientists who are knowledgeable about fish.

122
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:08,592
Though we didn’t have those, we were knowledgeable about them. I know them because I always used to fish.

123
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:18,098
And I know the ones that stayed downriver with flowing currents. They’re discernible.

124
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,363
Those are things I learned, what I learned.

125
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:30,749
Also, when it would be windy in the spring, they said that it heralded fish.

126
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:32,855
How was that?

127
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:36,835
That’s what they observed.

128
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:41,539
It’s good to observe this world, our world.

129
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:44,012
I see.

130
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:48,649
If you want to say anything else, or if you have nothing else to say.

131
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:51,141
I’m extremely thankful now.

132
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:58,312
I want to join you to speak about this ancient way like this.

133
00:14:58,324 --> 00:15:06,124
And that person, you know, who was he again? Twitchell.

134
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:10,774
I’ve wanted to speak, but since I didn’t go downriver, I haven’t.

135
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,042
Willie...

136
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:24,946
Willie, what’s your view on the unification issue?

137
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:36,797
The unification issue has been a topic of discussion on AVCP’s convention, I would guess for the last four to five years.

138
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:50,504
I think it has made a slow progress, but nevertheless, it takes time to work on issues of relevence that affect the whole region.

139
00:15:50,604 --> 00:16:03,046
Just recently, prior to the convention we had in what we call a Unification Forum Meeting in Emmonak, where the regional nonprofits were invited

140
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:17,139
And at that time, we discussed with Nunam Kellutestii, Ceńaliulriit, YKHC, AVCP, and Yupiit Nation

141
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:29,789
About the unification process that AVCP has undertaken based upon the directions that they received from Kipnuk’s convention resolution.

142
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:44,301
At that time, we also understand that not many of the people in the villages really understood what the unification meant.

143
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:50,587
The unification that we’re talking about is the development of the regional tribal government.

144
00:16:51,373 --> 00:17:05,325
So, at the recommendations at the Imangaq forum meeting was that the nonprofits eats a supporting resolution in concept.

145
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:10,930
And we did receive commitment from the organizations that were represented there.

146
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:22,235
I believe that one of the things that this conventions will talk about how to select people to sit on what it’s called a constitutional committee.

147
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:38,974
The constitutional committees task would be to review how the other indigenous people in the United States, for that matter the whole world, organize under their own types of government.

148
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:46,479
As stated, as I stated earlier, not everybody understands the tribal government issues.

149
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:51,770
So, one of the tasks of this committee would be to educate the people.

150
00:17:51,779 --> 00:18:06,279
By that, I mean they will be traveling to regional senators to conduct series of public meetings to get people to understand and up to speed of what we would like to achieve under the unification plan.

151
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:20,118
I think one important thing about the unification plan is that the organization and their boards are not the individuals and the authority to develop this government.

152
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:34,274
Ultimately, the people in the villages, those that have the voting rights, would be the ones to vote on the issue, and then proceed with the development of a government.

153
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:41,092
You think you’re gonna see a lot of support after this unification forum?

154
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:42,793
I believe so

155
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:57,728
Based on some of the comments that I heard that there’s still a lot of questions that needs to be brought out and answered, and we had a little bit of taste of that yesterday when I gave the Yupiit Nation report.

156
00:18:57,747 --> 00:19:04,360
I think, especially the elders, have already understood the concept.

157
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:17,276
Bit it’s, according to the comments the comments from the elders that I’ve heard is that these young people that are bilingual aren’t too sure whether to go with the old ways or the new ways.

158
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:27,840
I think in developing a regional government under the unification process, both the old ways and the new ways needs to be incorporated.

159
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:34,632
So that whatever comes about would best represent the people, and work for the people.

160
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:37,013
One other question.

161
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:41,397
Though you didn’t say? (Yes.) Is it ready?

162
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:51,508
I don’t think AVCP is boycotting, not to rejoin AFN, and it’s on the agenda.

163
00:19:51,512 --> 00:20:04,363
What I think what I think AVCP wants is true representation of our desires if we are to go back to AFN.

164
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:16,025
And I think using the example of the 1991 process, AVCP had some specific issues that we wanted AFN to address.

165
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:21,933
But, on the eleventh hour, our concerns weren’t heard.

166
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:29,533
And for that reason, we did not go back to AFN, among others.

167
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:41,359
But that was the primary reason. I think if AVCP is to rejoin AFN, the AVCP leadership needs to sit down with AVCP leadership

168
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:53,668
And discuss how representation would have to occur, and AVCP needs to be involved in such a statewide organization.

169
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:57,684
Do you have any additional comments you want to [?].

170
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:05,705
I guess, as far as the convention here, the 2005th annual convention of AVCP

171
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:18,514
This, I view as a turning point where our people are beginning to understand that we need to work together as a united group of villages.

172
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:30,926
Whatever forum the unification comes out of, we need to support it indivdually and orginazaniolly in order for it to succeed for our desires.

173
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,040
(Thank you.) Thank you.

174
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,335
You should’ve spoken in Yup’ik.

175
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,690
The [?] that it covered.
