1
00:00:01,444 --> 00:00:07,722
When we were boys back then, our parents

2
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:18,247
When my parents were alive, it’s like they encouraged me to go to the community house.

3
00:00:18,646 --> 00:00:21,690
They wanted me to partake in the community house.

4
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:29,909
And so I obeyed them, since I did not go against my parents’ wishes.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:41,047
But since they were not young, since they were old, I lived without going against their wishes.

6
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:46,992
According to their request, I would go to the community house.

7
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:55,520
Yet when we entered the community house, there was a great many people all the way inside.

8
00:00:55,532 --> 00:01:05,755
And the area here that they call the side wall had an entrance from below where you would go up from down there.

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,738
And they would call the area further inside the back wall.

10
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:15,357
And they would call this area, the area toward the door.

11
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:20,519
There would be a great many people inside the community house.

12
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:32,510
And the area inside close to the evening like this, the men stopped working when the men went to the community house since they didn’t always stay in the houses.

13
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:36,436
The community house was their real home.

14
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:45,522
As for the two old men, [one] stayed here toward the door at the very end

15
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:50,573
And [the other] across there was at the very end.

16
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:55,192
They brought forth traditional wisdom.

17
00:01:55,732 --> 00:02:05,121
Both of those who instructed on the future, after having the one on this side speak

18
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:12,054
After bringing what they needed to say about how they should be

19
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,337
He spoke about how they should live, and how they should be.

20
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:26,287
Then when he was done, the one across fixed it.

21
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:40,498
They said a person should live like this. Though they lived in the community house, were fathers, had many children, the didn’t disregard what they said.

22
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,257
The community house would be quiet when they spoke.

23
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:58,085
About how they should live, the two speakers would say that they shouldn’t be haughty people.

24
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:00,368
They said we shouldn’t be haughty.

25
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:11,482
They said, however, to remember the floor, the floor down there where they trod that has grass strewn about it.

26
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:21,108
They said that we should live remembering that, trying not to be haughty.

27
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:26,696
Then they said that if we do that

28
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:41,080
Also, they said that we should try to help these elders that were born before us with what they want.

29
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:55,893
Or also, we should not let an elderly couple lack water, go to them if we know them, and get water for them.

30
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,822
Also, if their door below needs fixing, to fix it.

31
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:16,423
Then, they do not await boys like this even though they’ve become fathers from what we heard of the two in the community house.

32
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:30,142
They didn’t wait for boys, though he became a father and had two children, they would completely follow their traditional wisdom.

33
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:36,539
Then, since we people are not the same

34
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:52,359
Since we are no the same, some people would regard what they said as if they didn’t see or hear it.

35
00:04:54,387 --> 00:05:01,231
They would speak like that about one who was like that.

36
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:08,993
They said that he will not live to that day, will not be Cup’ik.

37
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:21,153
However, the one in the community house would closely observe the one that obeyed their traditional wisdom.

38
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:34,000
They said that a person who follows traditional wisdom, completely follows it, will live for quite a long time.

39
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:43,764
They said that it will be like his breath "squats down [more firmly]" if he is obedient.

40
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:51,880
And he doesn’t bring down those around him, and he doesn’t speak unfavorably about those around him.

41
00:05:51,896 --> 00:06:03,285
The same for the young people, and the same for small children, those speakers would tell that person do be like that.

42
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:11,113
So, it seems that it’s true.

43
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:25,197
Look, in my life when I traveled from Qissunaq down there, when I traveled from Qissunaq on the coast of the sea in my life

44
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,116
I was also born there.

45
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:43,361
As soon I started travling by sled when that priest baptized me, since my baptism then as soon as I started traveling by sled

46
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:48,898
Since then, my age has been clear from that time.

47
00:06:54,189 --> 00:07:02,033
Then my father would also tell me

48
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:10,083
He told me to never go to these villages like this.

49
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:17,082
You know how when some do insignificant things to us, they get angry.

50
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:23,500
They answer to those who do things to them not to use it.

51
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:28,000
He told me to live without using it.

52
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:38,451
Especially if she’s a woman, I should not reply [badly] to her if she treats me badly.

53
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:44,539
He told me to turn away from her without replying.

54
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:55,873
Then he said that if my age-mate, if I do that from my age-mate, if he keeps doing that to me

55
00:07:57,232 --> 00:08:02,643
One of them pushing me back, and one of them saying I’m not a good hunter

56
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:16,766
If he pushes me back, also saying I have nothing, one of them may say that I’m not a good hunter, and I have nothing, no little thing.

57
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:22,778
He said that if we can’t take him anymore that we should then reply.

58
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:28,820
My father used to instruct me like that, to reply with anything I want.

59
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:37,226
He said that the one who picked on me will stop if I answer him like that.

60
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:43,821
In my observation, that would seem to be true as well.

61
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:58,232
You see, a long time ago, we young people only went forth through our elders.

62
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:03,942
They held the two who spoke about the future in very high regard.

63
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:15,211
And one of their traditional wisdom, I was coming here from far over there, I was coming

64
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:24,432
Eventually it became like this: when I looked around, there were completely different houses.

65
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:33,519
They had houses made completely of sod, using wood inside their houses.

66
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:41,703
They also used grass. They also used sod to insulate their houses.

67
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:49,920
And their women were absolutely not sedentary.

68
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:54,353
They made various things.

69
00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:01,032
If they’re in the house, they put grass underneath, and spread them out for matting.

70
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:07,128
They called those naqtat, the ones they made long and used for matting.

71
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:17,755
Then inside their house, it would be beautiful with those stuck in with little tack-like things.

72
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,293
And there wasn’t just one person in that house.

73
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,967
And this part had those between it where a person would be.

74
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:33,285
And toward the door from there, it had those where a person would be.

75
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:41,512
Those houses wouldn’t have just one person.

76
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:53,110
As I was coming, those who elders who would speak of the future

77
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:59,153
If they become unnoticable, they can be changed

78
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:05,609
The ones who speak of the future for these boys.

79
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:14,982
These women who would serve [their elders], however, in their houses over there

80
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:17,987
Their grandmothers instead worked on them.

81
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:25,123
It’s one with the [men’s] traditional wisdom when I look closely.

82
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:37,861
She’s not actually my grandmother, but when my maternal aunt spoke to my older sisters

83
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:44,420
Their traditional wisdom is exacly the same and compliment each other.

84
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:52,245
And their admonishments are one, and their instructions are also one.

85
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:58,374
We do not hear any surprising traditional wisdom from them.

86
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:14,993
Then now, they say, those elders say

87
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:24,502
They said that we Cuppot will get Westerners, other kinds [of people] among us.

88
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:33,691
They said that there will be among us people different from us, people with different lives from us.

89
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:37,014
It turned out to be these Caucasians.

90
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:51,420
Then back when those Caucasians traveled among us who where from over in Carvanertuliar on the Yukon

91
00:12:52,608 --> 00:13:01,823
They would say, "There will be more of these people, more and more."

92
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:13,142
They said that we Cupiit would eventually be among different kinds if there are more of them [than us].

93
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:18,523
Also misfortune if there are more of them [than us]

94
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:31,493
What would cause us misfortune that they would not want upon us gets bigger and increases

95
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:36,955
No matter what we Cupiit want to do to them, we will be unable to [deal with] them.

96
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:45,685
But I am pretending to be good now as I started speaking, since I have started speaking as a teacher.

97
00:13:45,686 --> 00:14:00,472
No matter what they do to us, let us not lower ourselves. Let us try to work with them as much as we can.

98
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:05,046
They do not own our land.

99
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:14,805
And here in Alaska, not matter where they’re from, even if they come from far away

100
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:26,025
They are trying to help those lands well because all of this belongs to each of them the same way.

101
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:37,254
However, let us not do that though they do that to our land here.

102
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:45,061
Let us Cupiit help each other.

103
00:14:45,074 --> 00:14:55,603
I also encourage my descendants to come that even if they do that to respond to them.

104
00:14:57,308 --> 00:15:07,194
Since I will not always be with those boys, my young people, over in Chevak, I [tell them] my traditional wisdom.

105
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:15,419
It’s been a long time since I’ve passed on my traditional wisdom through their school

106
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:30,283
It’s been a long time since the BIA took care of our school. We from Chevak were the very first to take our school.

107
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:40,282
Then we took it, and no matter what they tried to do to it, they couldn’t do anything.

108
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:56,220
And my former peers who are not known know, when I was recently in a meeting along with Caucasians, along with the school officials

109
00:15:57,772 --> 00:16:08,587
Since those were my source of strength, though they [?] these, I was the only one who had them as my source of strength.

110
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:13,950
But I have taught one of my grandchildren.

111
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:22,323
He does the things I say. He’s good.

112
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:27,017
Doing this, trying to keep going

113
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:40,946
Trying to keep going no matter what those around them do, to those who are young

114
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:48,726
He is called, they call him this: he is a good person, he is good.

115
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:55,143
What will [?] want to use...
