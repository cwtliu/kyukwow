1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Please speak.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,500
What’s our conversation going to be like?

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,000
Does it seem like it’ll be good in that machine?

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if it’s not too long, you can say what you have to say without lingering on anything.

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
It’s good, it’s fine.

6
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

7
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:11,000
I only speak of my earliest memories and what I’ve realized.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Also, we elders have realized now

9
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:31,000
We realized that it’s like we don’t own our land here, our very own land, anymore.

10
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,000
We don’t do what we want on our land anymore.

11
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:47,500
And then, we can't do what we want in our waters either.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,500
But I do have some ideas when I think about the people who will live in the future.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,500
We who have become like this will not be standing for many years because we people are [like] flowers.

14
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:19,400
Our offspring grow too. Those first ones who grow pass away.

15
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
That’s true.

16
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,000
I always think about this:

17
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:36,500
Downriver in Napakiak, probably around 1971, a Caucasian who came for the first time said this:

18
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,000
If we don’t determine our hunting grounds, we won’t have any land.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And at the time, I admonished them against following those allotments. Turns out [I was right].

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Shortly after, that representative arrived again and said this:

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,500
Caucasians are going to come and cover this land.

22
00:03:08:600 --> 00:03:13,500
[S]he said that if we don’t do that, we will have no lands or hunting grounds.

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,500
Pity, we believed and established allotments.

24
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,500
And then we realized after that

25
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:39,500
That our children and grandchildren have nothing from here from us, the ones we’ve always loved.

26
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Did we give them to our [Caucasian] counterparts? Did we give it to them?

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,500
And then I think like this:

28
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:10,000
When we elders, we elders or those who can vote, are gone, what’s going to happen to this?

29
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,000
Who’s going to uphold it to our way of life?

30
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,300
By my estimate, no one will uphold them.

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And even though our children are Yupiit, they won’t uphold it when they go forward with it.

32
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And then, a lot of people don’t like my advice.

33
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:48,000
I may not speak correctly about many people.

34
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,000
We heard, I personally heard recently some time ago:

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If we become the Yup’ik Nation, we will proceed to our way of life.

36
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,500
I examined it and realized

37
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:32,000
That if we’re the Yup’ik Nation, we will not go anywhere with our way of life, but only if we are traditional.

38
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:44,000
If we are traditional with no Caucasian governers, but govern ourselves as we did in the past.

39
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:58,000
And this allotment has become a cause for unrest for Yupiit today who claim they own that land.

40
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wr all understand this: land ownership leads to unrest.

41
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:22,500
However, I want youpl to outline a huge area of land like this and speak of it to [non-Yup’ik people] out there.

42
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I say in my mind that I want youpl to do that.

43
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Last year, I wrote to them out of state.

44
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:50,000
And I am speaking of it because my grandchild sent it and wanted me to end it with that.

45
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I’ve said this, I’ve said a lot, that since our earliest memories, our children and grandchildren are lost.

46
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:14,000
And I say that we are lost in out own lans as if we've become outsiders.

47
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:24,500
We’ve already become unable to do what we want on this land. It’s like we’re outsiders.

48
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:37,000
Now, if we disapprove of that, if we truly disapprove of that, let us look at the traditional [way of life].

49
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Many will call me crazy now.

50
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If we go forth as the Yup’ik Nation, we will be governed by Caucasians from out there.

51
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,000
Let’s gauge the situation. AVCP already governs us.

52
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Official documents have been established to go as Yupiit and we are told to go forth with those.

53
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,500
That is the way to go as Westernized [people].

54
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:27,000
But the traditional [way of life] is for us to be ourselves, so we can go forth as we want.

55
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,500
In my opinion, I prefer that because it has been part of my earliest memories from long ago.

56
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Villages didn’t have governers. All of them were only governed by one of their own elders.

57
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:57,00
Even though it’s not a lot, I’m speaking about it because I don’t want to disregard my grandchild’s opinion.

58
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,000
How does this seem to you?

59
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,500
[?] It’s good. I like it.

60
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
About how one should traditionally live.

61
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:38,500
Because my grandchild also brought this up, even if I don’t know a lot, [I’m speaking] only about what little I understand and know.

62
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,000
I only saw a little of it.

63
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:54,000
We saw what [s]he asked about through how we didn’t see a lot of these [Western] things

64
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,000
All of us who have grown up without anything [Western].

65
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,500
And then [s]he asked me this: if we [govern] ourselves, how will our lives go?

66
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:30,000
I can answer with this: the ancestors were the only ones to grow up with, going though what the ancestors instructed.

67
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
[They] also hunted with the ancestors’ instruction…

68
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Now, start by bringing up what they asked.

69
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,400
Leave out what’s not recorded in there and finish it?

70
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Yes, please start by bringing up what you [said] about his question.

71
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay, yes, I have no idea where I stopped. (It’s okay. Just start.)

72
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:34,000
When my grandchild asked me, [s]he asked about what will happen if Yupiit governed themselves.

73
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
When [s]he asked, even though I [don’t] know everything since I only know a little

74
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,500
I’m not the only one who knows. My peers who did not grow up with a lot of [Western] things like this know it.

75
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:07,500
We tried to obey and adhere to our traditional wisdom back when we didn’t have a lot of things including money.

76
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,500
You see? A person must only go forth [with the wisdom of] the ancestors.

77
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The elder did not come as a new thing, [but] as an ancient thing, ancient traditional wisdom.

78
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,500
And those who worked on fish for us were dexterous, those who instructed us on fish.

79
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:50,000
We were instructed like this: do not make a mess of food and food scras when we didn’t have freezers.

80
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:59,000
And it depends on the fish cutter. We stopped depending on her.

81
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,000
We wouldn’t [gather] what would spoil, as they say [in English].

82
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:17,000
And then we also walked on land as the ancestors instructed. Only though the ancestors’ instruction.

83
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,500
We especially tried to obey instruction in the fall and spring.

84
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,500
It was because the land and the water were dangerous in those2 times.

85
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:43,400
Because it was dangerous in those2 times, our ancestors especially instructed us on those.

86
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:51,500
And then about how we should live, how we should live treated our fellow people

87
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,500
They told admonished us against [treating them badly] just because we’re people.

88
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We didn’t understand this at the time, but we realized what it was later.

89
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,000
Living life [treating others badly] just because we’re people is like this:

90
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:23,000
A person [who treats others badly] just because he’s a person does not watch what he says to other people, and gives no consideration about offending them.

91
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,700
He also does not have love or good thoughts.

91
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,500
They say that one who is like that does not live another day, as they say.

92
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Those are our sources of support

93
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:55,000
Before we started going with these books, before these books started dictating us.

94
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,000
We had mercy on someone pitiful.

95
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Also, the state apprently has this without our compassion:

96
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,000
A person should abondon his child when he’s 18, stop teaching him, and have him live separately.

97
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,000
That is not how we Yupiit are instructed.

98
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They say that even when a person becomes an old man, though his daughter gets old, though his son gets old, he does not steer them wrong.

99
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,500
It’s said that we should not stop [caring for them].

100
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,500
However, the way our counterparts go is very unsuitable to us.

101
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:59,500
Now, all of these students disregard us elders.

102
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,000
They only trust in the wisdom of the books that they know, truly.

103
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:14,000
A child of the next generation talks back straight away when instructed.

104
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,500
Or he is offended by instrucion when they are corrected.

105
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,500
I am so thankful, my grandchild, that I’m telling you this.

106
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,500
It’s not mine. It’s ancient from long ago.

107
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What we know here is from ancient legends.

108
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:50,000
Eventually we’re alive, they are born. Eventually, they’ve come to those who remember them.

109
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Thank you very much.

110
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,000
I should dearly thank you, also because I’m surprised to have come in here.
