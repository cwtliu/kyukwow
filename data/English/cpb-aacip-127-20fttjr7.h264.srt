1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,000
When spring starts, we’re going to talk about that.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When those playful times are over when spring starts like this

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:28,000
Those who were going to travel like this, those people long ago
who were going to travel

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This was our first tradition for the young ones who did not have kayaks yet

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,500
When we were boys, they were the same as these helpers

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:05,000
Even though [the orphans] also played

7
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:16,000
Even though they played during this time, they didn’t for a long time.

8
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:27,500
This, being hungry like this, made us [return home].

9
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,000
And then we children here

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
When one of these hunters happened to catch ringed seals
we would be extremely excited

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Because we would be full for a time.

12
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:03,500
However, we would gather there in the community house
where we would listen to traditional wisdom.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
One who caught ringed seals would bring the stomachs
to the community house.

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,700
That was also accompanied by berries cooked in blood.

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:30,500
Every one of us in the villages would be extremely excited for that.

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:46,000
Another tradition among those hunters was that
they did not waste any of their things.

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:59,000
When they hunted them, it was like they were hunting
for their people, their villages.

18
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:12,000
And then those who had become elders especially
supported their youth who were trying to make a living.

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They wholeheartedly supported them.

20
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,000
After they worked with them all winter with their traditional wisdom

21
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They would wholehearted support them, not wanting those
who were trying to make a living feel defeated.

22
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:49,000
You see, a long time ago, back when we were growing up,
they were not like how it is now.

23
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,000
They didn’t have everything available to them.

24
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:03,500
And in the mornings like this, we would not get up being satisfied [with sleep].

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,700
Back when we were struggling for food and tools,
we were not like how people are now

26
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:24,000
But we grew up being pitiful back when we were growing up.

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We didn’t even have a lot of clothes.

28
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:36,500
Instead, we who had no fathers carried a lot of sorrow.

29
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,500
We did not succumb to our minds, but were persistent and obedient

30
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We were in need of teachers for how to do well when we grew up.

31
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,300
Back then, hunting was only for men.

32
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,000
We also wanted to be like those who were somehow good hunters.

33
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:13,000
But the people back then lived very hard lives
back when we were growing up.

34
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They also used to envy those big bearded seals down from the ocean.

35
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Those elders back then would not have us be lazy
in the winter before we made our own living back then.

36
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:45,500
Especially in the winter like this, we would always have a shovel
obeying their traditional wisdom.

37
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We only tried to keep putting animals to catch in our future.

38
00:05:52,300 --> 00:06:04,000
They would let the minds of those who were on the verge of becoming
hunters convince them to live life easy, but they would
urge those who were stubborn.

39
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:15,600
We also did not think about being paid with money,
but thought about how we would be paid with food to eat in the future.

40
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,400
You see, it does not make one disinclined when one
is hardworking or fixes things

41
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,000
And even if these doors weren’t ours, we would also help with their doors.

42
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Everything we did was to help others, those around us,
who were trying to survive.

43
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,500
We did that so that they would uplift us in their minds.

44
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,600
It would be true,

45
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:59,000
I also do that now when I am grateful like this,
when someone helps me and makes me grateful

46
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:09,400
I do not wish for them to feel defeated, but I push them
to do well in my mind.

47
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:19,000
If you do that, wisely being hardworking, your time to
make your own living is well on its way.

48
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,000
That will help whomever is wise.

49
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:36,500
When these people [have sexual relations with girls within a year of their
first menstrations], you know, the paths becomes bad for hunters, and there
is no path to go to hunting grounds.

50
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:43,800
It is as though that is correcting that within us
so that we could make our own living.

51
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,500
That’s how we grew up back then, obeying instructions
without succumbing to our mind’s desire for an easy life.

52
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,500
Since we did not succumb to our mind’s desire, that helped our bodies.
That used to be of help.

53
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But when we were clumsy when were striving to be hardworking
sometimes, we would be emotionally pained as we tried to make a living.

54
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,500
We didn’t sit like this when we traveled back then.

55
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,500
These days, you young people are becoming spoiled.
It’s also because you sit when traveling.

56
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:37,000
However, if your parents and fathers somehow do not raise you
[in the old way] like that, some of you probably will not do that.

57
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:47,500
But if you [are afraid of] that, you may definitely be like your parents.

58
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,000
He just told you about what would be useful.

59
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
After experiencing it, those teachers would
talk about it after using it.

60
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,500
And this traditional wisdom is not new.
It has come from a long time ago.

61
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And we who try to pass on that traditional wisdom,
it has also come to us.

62
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,500
That traditional wisdom from a long time ago.

63
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This traditional wisdom comes from a long time ago

64
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Because this traditional wisdom is for improvement,
self improvement for us, and improvement for you young people.

65
00:09:45,500 --> 00:10:00,300
And so, we will not move to subsisting down in the ocean,
how to subsist.

66
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We will also point out how their tools worked,
their handmade tools.

67
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,500
The things they used when they subsisted.

68
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And then, you young people who are obedient here,
I am going to add this:

69
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,500
We are reluctant to part with you young people when you’re
going to travel, as if you are going to come back from over there.

70
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And then, you must travel like that, trying not to destroy the future
you have yet to come to, trying not to destroy it.

71
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,500
Some young people here destroy themselves now.

72
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No person destroys him, but he destroys himself.

73
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,000
He also destroys himself including his future
that he has yet to experience.

74
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,500
For youpl, they are not [fun] even though there are a lot.

75
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:33,000
If youpl¬ want to live according to our2 traditional wisdom,
our traditional wisdom [is not fun] even though there
are a lot now.

76
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Even if you do not use them sometimes as you adhere to them,
if you get lonely, your minds will be filled with what
you must use, what you must strive to use.

77
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:02,500
However, if you try to hold on to everything fun, you will not
gain anything, and your minds will not be filled [with wisdom].

78
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:23,000
Now, when those who help us, your fathers, go down to the ocean,
youpl¬ probably hope that they would catch some of this food.

79
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Food becomes scarce these days, these days.

80
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:41,000
You can’t do anything anymore. And sometimes, you can’t play.

81
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Also, when these strong hunters, those who are strong without stopping,
even though they are not without food these days, they become skinny.

82
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:04,500
However, as they were standing on their legs and struggling,
they became like that.

83
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:15,500
And back then, they would work extremely hard as they struggled.

84
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:26,500
And when they traveled to villages like this,
they would travel with their kayaks.

85
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,000
Back then, they would chisel a lot of ice.

86
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:41,500
They would struggle, moving them using their legs,
not sitting like this.

87
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:55,000
They would use their legs to push forward, even if it wasn’t
always that, even if it wasn’t only for spring seal hunting,
because it was how they survived.

88
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,000
You see, a long time ago, we2…

89
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:12,000
Back then, before we started hunting by ourselves,
we would always work on subsistence.

90
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:22,000
We would listen to the teachers telling how how we should be
concerning subsistence.

91
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And then when they started hunting, the ones whom the animals
were afraid of would be revealed when they subsisted.

92
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:50,500
However, those who did not work on their minds would also
be revealed through their subsistence.

93
00:14:51,300 --> 00:15:00,300
Being incompetent is not enjoyable. I also know that when
I cannot catch food, it is not enjoyable.

94
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:11,500
They wouldn’t be set up with women, they wouldn’t
take wives before they first caught bearded seals.

95
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:25,500
But when they caught bearded seals twice like this, this young person
would not keep it twice, but would distribute it among people,
takelmurluku as they call it.

96
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
They would do that twice, including the skin.

97
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:44,500
And then when he gets married, they would be afraid that his wife
would distribute thin skins.

98
00:15:45,300 --> 00:16:04,000
And even though that had been done with two bearded seals like this,
when he takes a wife and catches another bearded seal,
they would have them distribute them including the skin.

99
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,000
We envied those at that time.

100
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:28,500
But when they had looked for things for themselves, I think they
were like that when guns were scarce, and it seemed that
animals to hunt [were not plentiful].

101
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:39,000
Also, those days, when the ocean’s wasn’t very deep,
they would also chisel the ice at that time.

102
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:53,000
And these days, our places where we would stay on the coast
when we traveled down to the seashore where the land would
be far inland is now down in the ocean.

103
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:04,000
Where we would stay down there is probably a mile out from the shore.

104
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:13,000
Back then, it wasn’t like how it was now when we
first became observant.

105
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Or, back when they didn’t use guns, when they only harpooned

106
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:38,400
After they would approach the ice during flooding season,
when the ice was going to come off back when they didn’t use guns

107
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,000
But they would stay ready with their tools.

108
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,500
And then as they were set in place, the animals down there
would start surfacing.

109
00:17:51,500 --> 00:18:00,500
But, they said that they would try to scare it off like this
with their atlatls.

110
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,000
They said that when it would be scared away,
they wouldn’t harpoon it.

111
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,800
However, they said that one that stayed even when they tried to
scare it off, only then would they harpoon it.

112
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,900
That’s what they used to do back then.

113
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And they said that when they surfaced like this, they would be
able to see water dripping from their whiskers.

114
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:35,000
But at that time, even though they had a lot to catch,
some of them would be in need because they didn’t have tools.

115
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
When those hunters would subsist like that back then

116
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
They had a lot of suffering, there used to be a lot.

117
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And the walrus bladders that would be filled with water like this,
they would have to keep it warm when they had no more water.

118
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:22,500
When they had no more water, after filling it with snow,
they would put it against their flesh inside to thaw it.

119
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:34,700
That’s the only way they would get water before the snow melted.

120
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
They had a lot of struggles.

121
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:53,000
Also, when some of them subsisted like this, this subsistence
is something that came to us from long ago

122
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,000
But it hasn’t come to these people here.

123
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:06,500
They would use their arms to subsist down in the ocean, using their arms.

124
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:27,000
But in making their oars, in making what would be their oars,
they would be instructed to make one lighter, and the other larger.

125
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,900
The things they would hold would also increase.

126
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And this gaff, what they call legcik, was essential.

127
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:52,500
When they did that, even though animals were available
down in the ocean

128
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,900
Even though the animals are available, they sometimes do not get any.

129
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,500
You do not catch anything down there without struggling first.

130
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:21,500
Only after struggling using his arms, after using them for a long time,
some people who subsist catch them.

131
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:31,400
And then when they did that, after taking care of his kayak

132
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:43,700
And then they would struggle, struggle to try to put
their kayaks inland where it’s not dangerous

133
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,700
When they catch those that they hunt.

134
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,500
Then they would put what they had strove to catch
around their kayaks.

135
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:06,000
And if he’s alone, it would take some of its liver.

136
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,700
He would run to the village with his legs.

137
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,600
But they had snowshoes. They always had snowshoes.

138
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:28,000
And then the villagers would come out like this,
watching the one who was appearing on foot.

139
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,000
Not one of them wanted to be anywhere else.
