1
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:03,777
I will ask you about that.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,633
I wonder how I'll do it? I don't know. I don't know too much about it.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,975
Your answers are good.

4
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:11,883
Oh, okay.

5
00:00:12,986 --> 00:00:14,210
I understand you.

6
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:14,772
I see.

7
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:20,313
The story you just told

8
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:26,654
What you just said to us,

9
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:35,896
How we should treat others with love though they are bad. What would be the reward for our hearts?

10
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:43,804
The reward for our hearts will be good in the future.

11
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:51,828
It seems that our reward will be that we will live in peace. You know, a person...

12
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:59,631
They said that people long ago, there is also traditional wisdom that all people

13
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:05,695
Some of them probably do not live right.

14
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:10,238
That is how one shouldn't disparage their husband.

15
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:17,121
So that we will be able to live peacefully in the future.

16
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:20,408
I see.

17
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:35,088
You've said the important thing. Do you have anything else?

18
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:40,094
Personally, you know

19
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:46,988
Looking at how we were back then, and how we are now

20
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:50,959
Many times, I pity young people.

21
00:01:52,209 --> 00:02:00,967
You know, they act in socially unacceptable ways, or they are leading bad lives.

22
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,502
They focus on misbehavior.

23
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:08,713
I pity those, you know?

24
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:18,274
Because I didn't grow up mischievous. I didn't grow up mischievous.

25
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:25,173
And being bad, even though I was bad sometimes,

26
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:29,670
I treat being a mother to my children with respect.

27
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:35,137
Because I only have my mind on wanting to live well.

28
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:39,396
These days, I pity young people

29
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:46,515
Those that do now know traditional wisdom because they are not spoken about.

30
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:56,862
But with your work with KYUK like this, if they show Yupiit speaking [about traditional teachings]

31
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:01,430
You will do good work.

32
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,157
And not doing this only in Yup’ik

33
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:20,509
In English, if you translate it into English so that the young people who only speak English will understand, you will do good work.

34
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:24,246
That’s the important thing I want to say.

35
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:30,175
Our Yup’ik ways, since we are being mixed today.

36
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:35,418
Married couples are not all Yup’ik. They have Caucasian spouses.

37
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:41,910
Their Caucasian spouses also need to understand how we Yupiit

38
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:49,908
How we would be good married couples. Caucasians can learn it too.

39
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:59,552
Show the traditional wisdom without delay.

40
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:10,720
Through KYUK or TV, since there are a lot of married couples now, young people, who are not gathered right.

41
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:18,906
Yes. I am curious about that, you know

42
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:27,540
Why are children more attached to mothers, not fathers?

43
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:38,632
Mothers stay in the house, and the fathers go out to travel, hunt, and work.

44
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:42,659
Our children are more attached to us mothers

45
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:46,230
Because we stay at home.

46
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:56,583
We prepare food, wash their clothes, take care of our families. We mothers are important in the home.

47
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,300
That’s why if children are obedient to their parents,

48
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:08,808
And if they’re especially obedient to their mothers, it will be good.

49
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:16,192
Those who are disobedeint to their mothers, their mothers get hurt.

50
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:21,376
Mother work hard on a lot of things in the home.

51
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:26,522
They take care of all of their children, and love them all.

52
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:30,697
However, a child who [disobeys] their parents

53
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:34,629
If he keeps disobeying them, their poor mother

54
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:38,734
Her heart will be hurt. That’s not good.

55
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:48,402
Their mother would not cry in front of her children, but cry without their knowledge, hurting in her heart.

56
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:57,610
If their children keeps disobeying their parents, they will make their mother suffer through that.

57
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:01,598
Being a mother is extremely important.

58
00:06:03,457 --> 00:06:07,595
And being a mother

59
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:16,210
Many people, even among these Caucasians, these young people need to know it.

60
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:24,447
If they respect their mothers without destorying their mental health, they will live well.

61
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:30,292
Yet if they do not respect them, they will lead bad lives

62
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:35,708
Misbehaving, doing the things she admonishes against.

63
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:50,829
These children without mothers or fathers who, you know, want do not have teachers, who can they go to?

64
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:54,889
Who can they go to if they want to learn them?

65
00:06:54,951 --> 00:07:00,420
Well, these orphans without mothers and fathers

66
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:07,630
Since I was an orphan, an elder, an elder lady, or

67
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:15,463
When an old woman or man taught me, I would be very thankful.

68
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:19,887
And so, these orphans

69
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:31,783
If they want to grow up well, they should go to their Yup’ik elders

70
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:39,350
They can ask them something. We can tell them how they would do well.

71
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:42,455
Thank you.

72
00:07:42,602 --> 00:07:43,989
You’re welcome.

73
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:48,425
If I have any other questions

74
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:53,041
If I listen, you know, some of them now

75
00:07:54,134 --> 00:07:57,662
You know, some of them had a commotion, or

76
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:04,622
You did well. You didn’t make sudden movements.

77
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:08,482
Yes, since I didn’t want to do that, I wanted to see your questions.

78
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,803
Yes, that’s good.

79
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,828
I didn’t want to waste time.

80
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,035
It would be good if Caucasians also listened to our conversation.

81
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:23,766
Because there are a lot of Caucasians, married couples who are half [Yup’ik] and half [Caucasian].

82
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:36,891
Rusty, don’t move around.

83
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:38,931
You might disturb her.

84
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,131
Sorry, I didn’t mean to be so, you know.

85
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:49,069
But since I told him to be quiet when he was talking, I told him to be quiet.

86
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:51,983
It’s okay. He’s my foster kid.

87
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:54,313
Really? He’s so adorably well-behaved.

88
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:57,856
I have two. The other is in school.

89
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:00,811
How is he your foster kid?

90
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,220
Through the state?

91
00:09:02,229 --> 00:09:05,838
Yes.They had me do it last year.

92
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,329
And he’s good now?

93
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,564
No, she’s going to [interview] me again.

94
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:18,442
This is just cutaways.

95
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:18,911
I see.

96
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:21,793
I need her to talk at length.

97
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:22,990
For a long time?

98
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:26,110
How?

99
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,528
Speak about random things.

100
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,792
Tell me stories about your children.

101
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:32,212
How?

102
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:36,753
How many children and grandchildren do you have?

103
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:39,683
What your children used to do.

104
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:44,370
I have ten children.

105
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:52,015
I have seven grandchildren. They are few, seven.

106
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:59,662
And they’ve all become adults, but only one, the youngest, is in high school alone.

107
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:04,612
And all of them, some of them are on their own now.

108
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:11,918
They’re doing well, trying to take care of themselves.

109
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:19,284
What’s going on?

110
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:20,704
No, I gave him something.

111
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:24,070
Oh, if you want to push it more, it can go further back still.
