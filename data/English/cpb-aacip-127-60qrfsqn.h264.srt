1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
...as soon as we got here. So are you ready?

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,190
Okay, okay. Here’s my last question.

3
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:25,670
Is our Yup’ik language

4
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:31,755
Well, our Yup’ik language. We’ve been speaking Yup’ik now.

5
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:38,750
To you, should the young people not forget it, and why?

6
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:41,785
It should not be forgotten.

7
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:57,410
If that person by chance comes across an old woman or an elder, he might need someone to speak for him.

8
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:10,790
If a person knows our language, and the English language, it is of great help to speak them.

9
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:18,430
You see, my grandchildren have a Caucasian father.

10
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,060
They  mostly speak English, but they know Yup’ik.

11
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,190
Elizabeth Howard’s children downriver.

12
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,300
They also help with communication to someone who comes to misfortune somewhere.

13
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,810
But since they are so hindered by k/q and r/g distinctions, they don’t speak much Yup’ik.

14
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:53,300
Um, we should not lose our language.

15
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:03,490
One will do well if he equally understand English and our langauge.

16
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:12,230
When he goes among Caucasians, he can speak like them, then when he goes to his own people, he can speak like them.

17
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,880
It will be well to have them equally like that.

18
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,100
Some... I swear, last question. This is the very last one.

19
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:36,650
Some Caucasians say this: those people gathered there who are indigenous, there is no one else in the world like them.

20
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:43,420
They are the only people like them, and their culture is unique to them. And no other has a culture like them.

21
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:50,610
And then they say that when they lost their langauge, they disappeared. It was like they were scattered.

22
00:02:51,320 --> 00:03:03,160
To you, if we lose our Yup’ik language, will we go extinct as if we were scattered? (Yes.) Will there be no more Yupiit?

23
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,350
Yes, we will do that, becoming unable to understand each other.

24
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:16,370
A Yup’ik here and our ancestors didn’t speak much of anything else, only mostly Yup’ik.

25
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:25,850
And then if a little Yup’ik forgets these Yup’ik things, I just told you about it.

26
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:39,400
Somtimes, when I admonish these little Yupiit speaking in our language, they answer me like this: "I don’t understand you."

27
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,240
And yet they are little Yupiit, and I speak admonishments to them in our language.

28
00:03:50,850 --> 00:04:04,350
And some would say, "That’s not written in our textbooks," when we explain our culture to them.

29
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,530
They’ve started leaning to these high school textbooks.

30
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:25,700
That’s all. (Okay.) Thank you very much. (Yes, you’re welcome.) Yes, thank you very much. (There you go.)

31
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,530
(He’s over there.) [?] is coming. Come if you want to.

32
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,190
Come through here.

33
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,640
Ready? (Yes.) Okay.

34
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,460
Okay.

35
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:10,410
And so, the ancient Yup’ik wisdom, and the various ancient traditional wisdom from back then

36
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:25,260
When Yupiit first started understanding the Qaneryarat [Bible], and when they first read and understood the Bible

37
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:38,480
They said that some found that they were similar. Is that true?

38
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,380
Yes, what they said is true.

39
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,000
Also, when they speak out it through these TV’s, I hear it.

40
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,820
They say that this wisdom is from long ago.

41
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:04,580
The wisdom is also present through what is in the Bible.

42
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:14,290
From the ancient ancestors here, that wisdom is theirs.

43
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:28,390
And because it was theirs, when these Bible appeared, we recognized what the old ones would say back then.

44
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:37,670
They said that they would speak as if they knew about the Bible, even their admonishments.

45
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:44,410
The admonishments have truly existed since ancient times.

46
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,200
(Are they no different?) They’re no different.

47
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:55,990
When I was small, I found growing up that we would listen to traditional wisdom.

48
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:05,490
When we were small and slept in the community house, the old men would speak to us.

49
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,920
And the girls would be separate in the house. (He might take your bike.)

50
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,810
That’s how it was. (Get your bike. Get your bike.)

51
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:25,870
Also, they wouldn’t let us boys sleep too comfortably.

52
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:34,090
Because I’m an orphan and didn’t watch my parents

53
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,860
I would do with what little I had.

54
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:51,790
And I would go to bed in the community house after gathering grass for a pillow, but would take off my skin boots.

55
00:07:52,650 --> 00:08:02,100
Now, when I tell the next generation about what I was like, they probably doubt me.

56
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:14,320
But the old men would say this to me: "As you go, if you make your own living, you will not be like that.

57
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,080
"If you do not forget where you came from."

58
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,420
This is indeed true.

59
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:31,240
And when I helped the old women like this, they would promise me. Apparently, it was for what was my future now.

60
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,960
And then, they would also tell me this:

61
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:48,700
"As you go, if you live to see another day, your descendants," it was apparently the next generations here

62
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,090
I would come to speak to them.

63
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:00,440
They said I would also speak to them if I didn’t forget their traditional wisdom.

64
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:10,210
Even though I have reached this age, the elders’ traditional wisdom continues to appear.

65
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:19,050
A person speaking like this does not speak of anything else in my observation, when I started being observant.

66
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:28,370
A person speaks of things that are no different from another, without any other traditional wisdom.

67
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:37,420
Also, in the spring liek this, this traditional wisdom still exists, and even women talk about it.

68
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:47,920
They told us never to be without a staff in spring even if we’re traveling by snow machines, sleds, or walking.

69
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:56,730
And if one walks on the ground in the summer, they also said not to be without a staff.

70
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:07,700
You know of those black things that are on the tundra. Those are dangerous.

71
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:16,760
If a person steps there and is pulled down without holding anything, he will disappear.

72
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:26,070
However, if he is holding something, that piece of wood he’s holding will save his life.

73
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,750
This is the wisdom passed down to me.

74
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:43,400
They also told them not to be too excessive with their descendants, including their children.

75
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,680
That’s what they would speak of.

76
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:54,480
But these days, I start remembering them.

77
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:01,770
And when I speak like this, I start remembering some of what they said.

78
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,520
You probably have something else to say, or ask.

79
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,300
I intended to ask Lucy.

80
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:23,240
Would the elder women also pass down traditional wisdom to girls?

81
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes.

82
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,350
Well, do you know my little older brother, Evan [Keggup’aq]?

83
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:41,410
Yes, his late mother would always speak to us about that traditional wisdom and instructions when she was alive.

84
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,390
And then about how to bear children, and how to have a husband.

85
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:57,330
And then they also had wooden circular calanders that they would stick wood into.

86
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:04,130
When the days, when the day reached that, they moved it and stuck it in there.

87
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,770
She would also teach us.

88
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:16,030
Our mother wouldn’t teach us because she was a little abnormal.

89
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,590
However, our father would talk to us about these admonishments or traditional wisdom.

90
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,520
Or, he would speak to us about what we shouldn’t do.

91
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:32,620
I would mostly be around our father because I wasn’t reserved around him.

92
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,200
My relatives, however, could not speak to him, only us.

93
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,480
Charlie and I would mostly speak to him.

94
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:49,940
And sometimes, when he was alone, I would be with him even though our mother was visiting someone else.

95
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,080
And sometimes after going with her, I would go home to be with him,

96
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:11,320
To you, Lucy, should we not forget the old Yup’ik wisdom today?

97
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:21,720
Yes, we should not forget the what the old ones said even when reaching this age, becoming an old woman.

98
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:29,210
Also, I speak to and admonish some of the children.

99
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,790
Henry, I also ask you that question.

100
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:42,860
To you, why shouldn’t we forget the traditional Yup’ik way of life and wisdom?

101
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:56,590
One should not forget traditional Yup’ik wisdom, trying to live differently.

102
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:06,840
It turns out we must remember the elders’ traditional wisdom.

103
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:14,530
I never used to remember them back before I took a wife.

104
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:24,610
These days, it seems that when I do things like this, and when I do little things

105
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:34,120
And when I walk around dangerous areas, I start to remember that.

106
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:45,850
You should not forget ancient Yup’ik wisdom at this age.

107
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:58,370
Also, some say this: elders do not teach anymore these days.

108
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:09,620
However, they would tell me this: as I go, I will start teaching.

109
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:22,080
And because I remember that these days, I speak to and admonish these next generations.

110
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,620
I also speak about how the effects of traveling.

111
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:39,940
And now, some fo the ones I used to teach help me out, and they thank me for speaking about those.

112
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:53,200
And recently, one of the boys over there who’s become an adult asked me what alcohol was like.

113
00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:01,020
And since I had experienced it and know it, I told him what I was like.

114
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:11,150
I told him this: "When I was an alocholic, I didn’t have much.

115
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,490
"However, since I have stayed away from alcohol these days

116
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:27,160
"It seems that these things I have are available.

117
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,730
"And when I think of something, I take some money and get it."

118
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:42,990
I told him that if he does that, try to quit drinking alcohol before it brings misfortune upon him.

119
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,180
I told him I’d be thankful if he quit that.

120
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:55,700
We shouldn’t keep from answering a question from the next generation.

121
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,490
But it’s better to keep teaching him about his future.

122
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:09,060
Also, when I speak over in the high school

123
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:17,810
I speak to them, including the girls, about what’s in their futures

124
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:25,290
Going up to when a girl takes a husband, and a boy takes a wife.

125
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,270
That is the wisdom passed down to me.

126
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:40,760
They said that if I do not take care of what little I have, I will have nothing.

127
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,060
You know about those who are frugal.

128
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,310
It better to save these little things.

129
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,440
He isn’t without anything, able to take and use them.

130
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,000
Anything else?

131
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,740
Yes, I will ask you this other question.

132
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:16,650
Lucy, to you, concerning the young people these days, including boys and girls

133
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,060
Are they becoming more mischievous and disobedient?

134
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:27,050
Some of them seem to do that.

135
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:40,730
Even if their fathers or mother speak to them, and when another speaks to them, and when I speak to them, they do not believe.

136
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,780
Those who are not taught from the beginning probably do that.

137
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:53,870
They are like that. They seem to doubt and not believe them.

138
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,340
We tell them that they will experience them someday.

139
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:12,050
And the traditional wisdom and saying, they say that we elders do not speak about them anymore.

140
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:23,810
These admonishments or what’s in the Bible, they say we don’t speak about them anymore.

141
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:35,050
Henry, concerning the reason for becoming disobedient, the young people’s disobedience

142
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:43,870
Because they are losing Yup’ik wisdom and their langauge?

143
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:51,300
You know, they don’t understand Yup’ik speech anymore. Does that seem to be the reason to you?

144
00:19:52,190 --> 00:20:01,490
Yes, at least the recent generation starting after 1950.

145
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:15,460
We know that they’ve recently started speaking only in English.

146
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:28,490
And these days, some of them don’t have instructions, Yup’ik instructions, anymore, with no idea what they are.

147
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:41,700
But their parents, in my opinion, if the parents speak to the ones who only speak English about the Yup’ik way of life [in English], it would be better.

148
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:49,760
However, those who speak Yup’ik understand.

149
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:59,410
And since I’ve been speaking upriver in the high school starting two years ago, I know that.

150
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,180
Some of them say this:

151
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:14,110
With the Yup’ik way of life, what the West say is more true.

152
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,710
Western wisdom is more true.

153
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:23,587
However, they say that Yup’ik wisdom is not.

154
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:31,042
They’ve started turning to the West because they’ve started speaking only in English.

155
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:37,841
That is how they answer.

156
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:46,596
That’s all. (Okay.) That’s probably enough. (Yes.) Okay.

157
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:53,561
Thank you for having me speak. I always think that I won’t have a chance to speak like this.

158
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:56,351
That’s okay. We’ll come again sometime.

159
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,641
Okay. (Okay.)

160
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,216
These, it’s done.

161
00:22:00,376 --> 00:22:03,271
That was one side of a whole tape or what, one tape?

162
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:06,331
That was the rest of the tape that we put in there.
