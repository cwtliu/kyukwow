1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,800
I’m struggling, also because my eye is bad. The light is bright for me.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I wish I had black sunglasses.
(I’m sorry.)

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Alright.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Talking with Paul G. and Lucy Nicholai for the record
just in case we don’t know who they are sometimes.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,500
(In Yup’ik too.)
And in Yup’ik, Cialuq and… what’s your Yup’ik name again?

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,000
My real name is Qakvaralria, but when my late older brother passed away

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,900
I wonder why they changed it?

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,500
Now, they call me Neviar.
(I see, yes, okay.)

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,000
You probably know her English name.
(Yes, yes.)

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, there’s no way you wouldn’t know.

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:07,500
Yes. And then Cialuq first, the season around us
is spring now.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:23,000
Were there admonishments in the time of people back then
that they should follow in the spring?

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Various things. This was the only…

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So they’re talking with this camera.

15
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay.

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Okay, proceed.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,400
Yes, right around here then they’re talking with [us].
(Okay.)

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,900
They [said] this, and you know them too

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,500
Our caretakers back then when spring set, when spring set like this

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,800
They would tell us to always have an ice spud because it’s our eyes.

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Indeed, you know it too.

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,400
There’s nothing else.

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:14,000
The old people, the old people only made completely sure
to admonish us against being reckless.

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,500
Who were you in Yup’ik again?

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,800
Nev’aq.
(Nev’aq, okay.)

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,900
Neviaq.
(Neviaq.)

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,500
Neviar.
(Okay, Neviar.)

28
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:38,000
Back when you were a girl, you probably went with
your family when they went to spring camp.

29
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,500
Do you want to say anything concerning that?

30
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,000
When we went to spring camp like this, youpl don’t know
Arnangiaraller, the mother of the late Iqalluk and famiuly

31
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:58,000
She would say this to us when we would travel about in the wilderness:

32
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:10,500
“Take a walking staff. You see, if you should even trip,
you can get out [of water] by putting the staff on its side.”

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,300
She used to tell us that.

34
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,500
It seems he knows about Yup’ik ways.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Sometimes, I’ve also heard them say to be quiet in the evning.

36
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.
(Why?)

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,800
They told us to be quiet.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They said, you see, that the nepengyaq would be attracted by our noise.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What?
(A ghost.)

40
00:03:50,800 --> 00:04:04,600
Also, when the people from Kwethluk would go
to their spring camps or when they went hunting

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Would there be no one left a long time ago?

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,400
They went up. They said not many stayed behind.

43
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,800
I didn’t know about those old things back then.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
They said that there weren’t a lot of people in Kwethluk

45
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,500
Because [our] ancestors would hunt for ground squirrels.

46
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,800
That’s what their subsistence.

47
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,500
We can’t live those old ways that were lost.

48
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,500
You probably know them.

49
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,000
As we always babysit, I don’t go to [Qula] anymore.

50
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,300
Were there a lot of animals they hunted around Kwethluk back then?

51
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:03,000
My goodness, they were not scarce when our late caretakers
[set] fish traps and animal traps.

52
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,000
I didn’t set animal traps because I only had a few
[from] my late father.

53
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,900
Like Westerners, these Westerners are making these [people]
unlike Yupiit [back then]

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,500
[Using] animal traps and fish traps, material for fish traps [back then].

55
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,500
I am still doing that now with a fish trap

56
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,000
Only for black fish.

57
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:44,500
A long time ago, did people have a tradition of
giving water to animals they had caught?

58
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,400
Animals from the coast. Animals from the cause.
(They dipped them, they dipped them, yes.)

59
00:05:50,400 --> 00:06:02,000
I used to see, and you probably don’t know valerians,
you know, the roots of flowes that smell nice placed on their noses

60
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,400
And they give them a little food or water.

61
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,800
They probably did that to all [animals].

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don’t know the very old ways. But…

63
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,900
Why did that do that to them?

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They said they treated them as guests.

65
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,500
They pretended to receive them as guests.

66
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:29,500
You see, they also did that a long time ago to fish,
and putting [food or tobacco] in their mouths.

67
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,400
Animals from the coast.

68
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,900
Have you ever seen that? We used to do that a long time ago.

69
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,000
We were small, I wasn’t tall, I was small because
we were orphaned when we were small.

70
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,500
Yes, me too… he didn’t ask me.

71
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And then Neviar, these girls in the year of their first menstruations
a long time ago

72
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,000
Did they do it here in Kwethluk too or what?

73
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,400
They don’t anymore.
(Did they separate them from society?)

74
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,300
Personally, you see, a long time ago, they would say
that they didn’t have me abstain
because they didn’t want me to be destitute.

75
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,900
And yet they had me abstain and kept me from traveling a lot.

76
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,500
And then when we were going to move from spring camps,
they had me throw ash on into the water.

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Like that.

78
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,500
What is that?
(He might not understand.)

79
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,600
The water… do you know what araq is? You know, from stoves…

80
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,900
Where the fire had gone out. Where the fire had gone out.
(Where the fire had gone out.)

81
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,600
What was the reason?

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,500
That’s probably the custom of [our] ancestors back them.
(I don’t know, it’s their custom.)

83
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
She probably doesn’t know.

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It was our ancestors’ custom when they abstained.
(Yes, as expected, our ancestors’ custom.)

85
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,000
They say they don’t abstain anymore now.
They don’t abstain anymore.

86
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,000
I haven’t seen anyone abstaining.

87
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They also told us not to look up [at the sky]
during the year of our first menstruations.

88
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,000
Why?

89
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,500
They said we might lose our eyesight early.

90
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That’s how it was.

91
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
These…

92
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,500
They also talked about those, and I hear about this sometimes now.

93
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,000
Paseqaq down there tells me

94
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,400
That people jigging now catch fish

95
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:07,000
And then he said that when one of the girls did something

96
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,900
When she fished, they said that the fish “broke.”

97
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What’s that?

98
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,000
They tell girls within the year of their first menstruations
and those who miscarried not to.
(The people back then talked about those.)

99
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Even the fish know [that] they [had gone].

100
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,300
Is that the only admonishment for fish?

101
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:30,400
They talk about it like this.
Is that the only admonishment for fish?

102
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,800
They talk about it like this.

103
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,500
And spoiled food, they told them not to eat spoiled food raw.

104
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,000
She’s talking about spoiled food.
(Yes.)

105
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,500
They also told girls within the year of the first menstruations
not to pick berries.

106
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,500
They told them not to dig for mouse caches or pick berries.

107
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,500
They also abstained by eating only grebes and ptarmigans.

108
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,900
I personally did that.

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I only ate grebes, ptarmigans, and dried fish from the previous year.

110
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,900
Fresh [dried fish]…
(We wouldn’t eat fresh [dried fish].)

111
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,500
But they don’t abstain from [fish] from the coast
because they said that ones from the ocean don’t have slime.

112
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
Surfaced seals at least.

113
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,500
They don’t abstain from spotted or year-old bearded seals.

114
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:45,000
What do they call these months, these months here in Kwethluk
on the Kuskokwim starting from Iralull’er [January]?

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,400
I don’t know them in Yup’ik except for the first ones.

116
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:59,800
Some call them by Yup’ik names, at least the fluent ones.

117
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:09,000
I mean, you probably know some of them in Yup’ik too.

118
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,000
They’re written, but they say some aren’t the same.

119
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,400
Yes, because our dialects are different.

120
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,800
You see, they have different dialects even when they’re close.

121
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You know that.

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,300
And then, a long time ago before churches became prevalent here

123
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
When they buried people, they would put
their possessions on their graves.

124
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,800
Why did they do that?

125
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,000
They did that a long time ago, our ancestors back then.

126
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,000
Now, when a person passes away

127
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,700
You know, you also know that they burn their possessions.

128
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,900
They burned and destroyed them. They’ve started doing that now.
(And throwing them away.)

129
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,000
They don’t follow the old customs anymore.

130
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:14,000
They say that those, you know, various things,
pots, kettles, storytelling knives, necklaces

131
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,000
Those were grave markers.

132
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,500
That’s what they used to say.

133
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Because there were no Caucasians a long time ago, those people
would put their few possessions where they were to be set.

134
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,000
I also used to examine them over there, even old guns.

135
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,500
They say they would put them when they passed away.

136
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,500
These days, they give them to people.

137
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,000
It’s better, unlike before.

138
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,000
You know them too.

139
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Would you like to say anything about traditional instructions
that girls should adhere to these days.

140
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:26,000
They used to admonish girls against ever smiling at a boy.

141
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,500
They say a woman leads to death.

142
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,000
They said this: “A woman leads to death.”

143
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,000
They also told me never to stay out late in the evening.

144
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:55,000
They said, you know, that some creature would take me.

145
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:09,000
What about you? Do you want to say any traditional wisdom
that boys these days should hear?

146
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,800
You know, I only told you about what instructions I had?

147
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:23,000
When [the season] became like this, the staff with a point
that we call an ice spud

148
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They told us to always have those.

149
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,400
They say they show the way. Indeed, it’s completely true.

150
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You will know thin spots.

151
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,900
That’s what those elders back then used to say.

152
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,800
Before, the first thing I told you about was those people’s instructions.

153
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:57,000
And for a long time, because we were orphaned when we were young,
we did things ourselves.

154
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,000
Evidently, a person will only live by his traditional wisdom.
He will live [that way].

155
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,000
And if he’s sedentary, he won’t have anything.

156
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,400
You also observe these people who have nothing.

157
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,800
They call that being too lazy to do their work.

158
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:27,800
However, if one works hard despite not wanting do, even if he doesn’t
have anything, they say it’s like he’s rich.

159
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,000
He has things, even these pieces of wood.

160
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Indeed, that’s completely true.

161
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,900
Because that dear youngest one watched me

162
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,500
He gathers wood like this even though he is not ordered to
because he watched me.

163
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,000
I don’t have much else to say.

164
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,400
These days, to you, are young people mischievous?

165
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes.
(I don’t know what they’re doing.)

166
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,000
Personally, that one, you see…
(They’re different from what I’ve seen.)

167
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,600
They’ve become different now because of alcohol.

168
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,000
They’re nothing like a long time ago. You know them.

169
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,500
And a person wanders around for no reason,
and he’s immediately dead at the hands of alcohol.

170
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
They also speak without thinking.
(They’re not like before).

171
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:36,700
These elders know that every person does this.

172
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Alcohol is killing them off very quickly.

173
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,700
And some go together and die at once.

174
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,400
Or they drown, they mostly drown.

175
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,500
And some who have become different recently kill [themselves].

176
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,500
Suicide is admonished against.

177
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
They kill [themselves] over a woman.
(Someday when the world ends,
those who’ve committed suicide will not be saved.)

178
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,900
Even if a person is suffering, may [s]he stay.

179
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And even if [s]he wants what others have despite not being like them,
his peers wake up when they wake up.

180
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Now, you see me here.

181
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,000
I am alive like this.

182
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,500
But I take care of these two here.

183
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,900
But now, I can’t do what I used to before.
Pity, I don’t go drift netting much anymore too.

184
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,500
Now, during fishing season, I go once and sometimes a second time.

185
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:55,000
But I use a tethered net that I used to use for fishing,
at least small fish.

186
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,000
Does this, from you…

187
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Huh?
(Okay, keep going.)

188
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
For this, whichever of you2 can answer this.

189
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:25,500
Should we Yupiit not lose our past subsistence
that we also use today?

190
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,300
It truly should not be lost.

191
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,400
My goodness, what hunting implements a person has,
I didn’t tell you about them, you see.

192
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:41,500
When my late father removed his little fish nets, he would put them up.

193
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,000
That was his custom.

194
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:50,000
And now, I can’t do those.
I watched him.

195
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:09,300
Is our [Caucasian] counterparts’ instructions [or laws]
making it like our subsistence is being lost?

196
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,900
I’m not sure what going on with them.

197
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,700
Some people now, my goodness, they don’t remove their fish traps too.

198
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,000
Speak loudly to him.

199
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,000
You see, I don’t completely understand when people speak quietly.

200
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:34,000
Back then, did they respect elders?

201
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,500
Their tools?

202
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,600
No.
(Okay.)

203
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,600
Elders, did they respect elders?

204
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:52,500
Those people back then who are not like us,
those a long time ago, were intimidating.

205
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,500
You also know their customs.

206
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,500
We couldn’t treat them in any [bad] way.

207
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,400
They were intimidating. And when going into a house,
they couldn’t go further inside.

208
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,000
I couldn’t go inside even though I was mischievous.

209
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,500
I was hestitant to go inside out by the door.

210
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
I would only go inside when they told me to.

211
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,000
Now, they try to go out at the end of the house inside.

212
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:46,500
These days, should our young people keep from losing
our Yup’ik language and why?
(Yes.)

213
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,900
Why shouldn’t we lose it?

214
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:57,600
You see, these people who speak English, the ones they speak
[only] in English to, seem like they’re not completely wise.

215
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:04,000
My grandchildren here, Vera’s children, I tell their mother

216
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,400
“Look, speak to them in Yup’ik so that they’ll completely understand you.”

217
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Shoud, they teach this Yup’ik language in schools?

218
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,500
Yes, please.

219
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,400
Is that all?

220
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,500
Two minutes left on this tape.
(Okay.)

221
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Are we2 done?

222
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,000
We’re done.
(Okay, thank you.)

223
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,900
Okay, let’s see.
(Well now…)

224
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,900
Has Kwethluk always been here?

225
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
My goodness, Kwethluk was here in my earliest memories.

226
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,000
We were far downriver, and there were only several houses.

227
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,000
It wasn’t populous like this.

228
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,000
It was at the time of the store down over there.

229
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,000
The called us the Upriver People.

230
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,000
This here is the original Kwethluk.

231
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,000
My earliest memories are in Eek.

232
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And in my earliest memories, we were going down to
what they called Aparuka’armiut, as in…
