1
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:08,299
Now, you know how children play with toys.

2
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:13,393
You know in old times, they would play with small dolls, and tell storyknife stories that we don’t see now.

3
00:01:13,837 --> 00:01:16,870
Which do you think is more fun:

4
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:23,558
The children who do not tell storyknife stories or play with dolls, or the ones who played with dolls and storyknives?

5
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:32,070
Because these children play with Western toys

6
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,890
They’ve started watching TV, and stopped playing with the toys that we had back then.

7
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:51,991
You see, back when we were girls, we liked to tell storyknife stories.

8
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:57,280
We always had a storyknife with us.

9
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:01,071
What were the storyknives made of?

10
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:05,399
I had a storyknive made of a little ivory, ivory.

11
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,796
Ivory, and I’m not sure who made it. I would never stop telling storyknife stories.

12
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:23,160
Since we had friends, when our friends and we weren’t in school, there was only storyknife stories.

13
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:36,130
We would tell storyknife stories, and my friend’s and my way of telling stories, those villages had names. We preteneded they were Inlanders.

14
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:41,740
Some of the ones you talked about were the Inlanders?

15
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,055
What kinds of things would you tell stories about?

16
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:48,725
We made them a family. We said that this village

17
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:55,696
She would call the partners Inlanders.

18
00:02:55,749 --> 00:03:03,743
These was Nunapigngiar and family, and this was Ceńaqviuksuk and family were always the furthest over there.

19
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:09,460
She named those people Nunapigngiar and family.

20
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:14,385
We made up families and made them houses.

21
00:03:15,793 --> 00:03:19,565
Did they try to be the greatest? Did they try to be the best?

22
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:27,880
She gave them little things like us that we’ve seen. She would have them do as she did.

23
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:36,693
And when we didn’t tell storyknife stories, we would play string games with string.

24
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:48,527
But they would admonish us against playing string games for long, saying that a legendary little person would come in on us.

25
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:56,588
[It would come in] to those playing string games. We wouldn’t play string games for long, then quit.

26
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:01,067
I wonder why?

27
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:08,524
I don’t know. And in the summer, we would play with small dolls.

28
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:14,128
We had small dolls, almost every girl.

29
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:24,100
They would have a lot of small dolls. This would make up a small family.

30
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:31,660
And these dolls, we had those toys too.

31
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:38,271
What other toys were there?

32
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,727
We had small dolls.

33
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:50,320
And dolls, but when winter set, we would store away the dolls.

34
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:57,228
We only played with small dolls in the house, not dolls, but we went outside [to play with the dolls].

35
00:04:57,773 --> 00:05:04,561
Only when the birds came in the spring would we then start playing with dolls.

36
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,515
Why wouldn’t you bring them out? What would they say?

37
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:13,554
We wouldn’t bring those dolls out.

38
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:19,622
They said that if we bring them out, the weather will, you know

39
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:29,657
Summer would set late, constant blizzards, they said it would be strange. We wouldn’t bring dolls out.

40
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:33,076
Would you pretend to cook?

41
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:34,002
Do what?

42
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,940
Pretend to cook.

43
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:43,875
We always played, and we played outside making houses out of grass.

44
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:53,140
We wove grass into caches. We would play, pretending to have children and mothers.

45
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,197
We pretended to cook, pretended to do things.

46
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:05,784
Would you pretend to have women’s knives?

47
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,611
Yes.

48
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:11,274
Out of what? What kinds of women’s knives would you have?

49
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:15,229
What kinds of women’s knives did we have?

50
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:22,229
We would also make clothes for them out of sourdock.

51
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,265
We used grass for them. We would have fun when we played.

52
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:42,536
And back when I had grown a little, I stopped playing with small dolls and didn’t tell too many storyknife stories anymore.

53
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:46,674
But in the summer, I always paddled with a canoe.

54
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:53,580
I never stopped going to the wilderness every day because the weather would also be good.

55
00:06:55,504 --> 00:07:05,363
Did you teach your children to play like that, to make small dolls?

56
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:12,507
I didn’t make my children small dolls, but they had dolls.

57
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:20,910
Dolls, and I tried to have them tell storyknife stories, and they would pretend to tell legends.

58
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,272
What about the children [?who do not] do that today?

59
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:31,691
My grandchildren now only play with Western toys.

60
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,299
When they don’t play, they watch TV.

61
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,857
Do you think they’ll have fun if they tell storyknife stories?

62
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,518
They would have fun if they told storyknife stories.

63
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:47,818
It was also fun when we told storyknife stories.

64
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:58,840
When the men were going to travel, how would you prepare food for them?

65
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:06,560
How would you prepare things for them, you know, when you were small for your father or

66
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:12,148
Or when you took a husband, when your husband was going to go for several weeks?

67
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:19,630
When my father was going to travel, my mother would prepare for him

68
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:29,460
Food, tea, sugar for him. They always had portable stoves.

69
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:38,993
But when the weather was good, those men would cook outside.

70
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:46,674
Would they get their own food by hunting?

71
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:48,120
Yes.

72
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:56,620
Then I would notice that they would make drift nets out of [a certain type of] string.

73
00:08:56,751 --> 00:09:04,451
My father would also make a fishing tool by carving wood, making fish traps.

74
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:17,610
The men I watched would make fish traps for blackfish, and they added steel traps.

75
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:24,250
My spouse did too when we got married. We always went to winter and spring camp.

76
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:33,860
Then I realized that back when I lived with my family, my parents, when I lived with my parents

77
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:38,459
Every spring, we would move in March.

78
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:42,548
We would set tents on the snow.

79
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:49,288
And yet we weren’t cold. And we put the stove on the snow.

80
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:55,398
We would live in the tent starting from March.

81
00:09:56,153 --> 00:10:01,829
When we moved, we would camp, then after we camped

82
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:07,559
After we took our supplies ahead, after our father took our supplies ahead

83
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:13,370
We would then reach where we would stay. It would be wonderful.

84
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,360
And because the weather would be good

85
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,610
Even though we stayed in the tent, we wouldn’t be cold.

86
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,283
We were used to it since we had always done that.

87
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:29,718
In March, we would live in a tent.

88
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:34,117
Would you be hit by strong winds?

89
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:37,733
It would be windy sometimes.

90
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:42,317
But we would be able to use [the tent] in the wind.

91
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:46,489
And as summer was approaching, it would be rainy.

92
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,769
It would be wonderful with sunny weather.

93
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:57,029
So what would you women do when you traveled?

94
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,155
When we traveled?

95
00:10:58,205 --> 00:10:59,828
Going with them, you know, in March.

96
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:01,829
In March?

97
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:07,164
You know, you just told us that you would travel, right, in March?

98
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:11,848
Living in a tent, what would you women do?

99
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:14,839
You see, I liked to gather wood.

100
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:21,850
Early in the morning, right after dawn

101
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:26,539
I would get up and gather wood

102
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:32,419
’cause I was the oldest one, because I was the eldest sister in the family.

103
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,238
I always gathered wood, enjoying gathering wood.

104
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,535
So what would your mother do?

105
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:49,597
My mother never stopped preparing things

106
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:56,625
Everyhing my father would need, and she would make them waterproof skin boots.

107
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:04,437
And all of us had waterproof skin boots, handmade water boots.

108
00:12:04,568 --> 00:12:09,484
We would use those waterproof skin boots in the spring.

109
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,603
What were they made of? What were they made of?

110
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:17,170
We had waterproof moose skin boots, large caribou skins.

111
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:20,752
There used to be a lot of moose a long time ago.

112
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:23,947
All over, there were a lot of caribou.

113
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:37,830
And then in 1941, a lot of caribou died.

114
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:41,743
They also said wolves ate them.

115
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:47,034
Then the caribou were gone, no more caribou.

116
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:56,870
What would the parents do to lazy women, the lazy women?

117
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:03,272
They probable told the lazy women to do things.

118
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:11,950
What traditional wisdom would they have for lazy people?

119
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:17,361
For me, mostly only my father taught me.

120
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:29,973
He told me this: if I am lazy, to see that someday

121
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,626
I will try to make my own living.

122
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,201
And then if I am lazy, I won’t have anything.

123
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:48,824
He told me not to be lazy but to continously work, looking at the way these people do things.

124
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:55,070
And when berries grow in the summer, to pick berries.

125
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,990
And he said that if I have a provider, if my provider catches fish, to take care of the fish.

126
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:10,166
I should treat them with love, not be disinclined to do them, and not make a mess of them.

127
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:16,010
The people I saw back, my parents

128
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:23,920
They didn’t make a mess of fish, never made a mess, out of reverence for the fish.

129
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:32,190
Even if they’re bones, they told us not to put them on the floor out of love.

130
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:39,664
To revere them. He said, you see, that if we do not revere them and tread upon them

131
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,670
We won’t have things.

132
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:52,170
Or our drift nets will not catch anything, or our fish traps will not catch anything because we don’t love them.

133
00:14:52,252 --> 00:15:00,010
They told us to revere everything, and to even treat our clothes with love.

134
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:06,537
And now, to this day, I do not make a mess of anything.

135
00:15:06,761 --> 00:15:13,030
And even though there’s a lot of things, I do not make a mess of them out of love, but revere them.

136
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:25,578
And you know that fish have poison, fish have poison. How would you tell them apart?

137
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:32,205
The people I watched a long time ago would revere fish

138
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:37,047
They would not let the fish they worked on be exposed to the sun.

139
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:42,499
And on the net, what had been caught in the net that had been exposed to the sun

140
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:47,739
They would prepare the ones that had bloated to be food only for dogs.

141
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:56,430
That’s why they never had food poisining. I’ve never seen any person have food poisoning.

142
00:15:56,775 --> 00:16:03,308
And when I had grown up, not many people died.

143
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:11,360
Once in a great while, a person would die. And the people I saw wouldn’t get sick too often.

144
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:15,860
And I never saw anyone drunk.

145
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,590
But when I was 16, I saw someone drunk for the first time.

146
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:27,160
Now when girls are 16, you know, they become adults.

147
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:34,211
I became a woman late because I became a woman when I was 16.

148
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:42,760
And I got married to my spouse when I was 18. My parents chose my spouse.

149
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:54,424
What about those who sewed grass?

150
00:16:55,264 --> 00:17:02,018
I didn’t grow up with those who sewed grass, but they would weave grass.

151
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:11,688
And then women who had gotten older would make mats out of coarse grass

152
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:17,336
They would tightly weave them. They wove great things.

153
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:25,838
My grandmother died back then. I think she died when I was about eight.

154
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:37,129
That why when we weren’t playing, we would go to the old women.

155
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:42,980
I would have fun when they worked weaving grass.

156
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:51,430
Then it’s been recently that the Mikelnguut Elitnaurviat wanted old teachings.

157
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:58,026
Old things. When my mother was alive, they asked my mother to make things.

158
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:08,949
They asked her to make things in the old way, grass mats for kayaks, earrings, and I think necklaces.

159
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:15,107
Then my mother said that she wouldn’t. She said that I should try.

160
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:21,584
Then I wove grass, replicating the old women that I used to watch.

161
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:27,445
I wove grass like they did, making small warp strands with course grass.

162
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:38,650
I used some of them to thread through. The things they wove would be like this: these going this way, and these going this way.

163
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:45,950
They had small warp strands that were this thick. They wove grass like this.

164
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:53,880
Look, the little woven grass bag across there. Give it to me.

165
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:54,630
This one?

166
00:18:55,417 --> 00:19:00,822
There, no, there it is, yes, that too.

167
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:13,421
They would make mats like this.

168
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:19,947
They made warp strands like, and made the gaps this size.

169
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:29,430
I made grass mats for kayaks.

170
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:39,250
Then my mother watched and said to me, "Look, twist them this way like this."

171
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:45,388
Then when I started doing that, they started becoming like this.

172
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:55,900
You see, the small grass mats for kayaks I made are inland in Mikelnguut Elitnaurviat, and my name is there, Elena Charles.

173
00:19:56,901 --> 00:20:02,583
Then when they asked me to make a woven grass bag, I made a bad out of tall cottongrass.

174
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:05,540
I made it like this, but pretty big.

175
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:11,591
But the bottom down there got long, and I braided the end.

176
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:14,490
This is done well.

177
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,851
And the bottom here?

178
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:20,497
This is made very well.

179
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:27,830
Please hold it, connecting the bottom parts, showing the bottom.

180
00:20:37,545 --> 00:20:40,683
They would also weave grass to make fish carrying bags.

181
00:20:40,683 --> 00:20:45,725
When they didn’t have paper boxes, they always made bags for fish.

182
00:20:46,182 --> 00:20:48,975
And the dry fish they made would be good.

183
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,740
They would weave grass with this close pattern.

184
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:56,706
They called those kuusqulluut.

185
00:20:57,665 --> 00:21:05,710
Their openings would be woven, the grass would be woven to make ropes.

186
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:09,071
Would the aged herring be in them as well?

187
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:15,180
We didn’t have aged herring. I’m from [the] tundra.

188
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:22,580
And caches, every family would have a cache.

189
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:27,598
Fish cache, and it would have wooden posts.

190
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,211
It was airtight up there, and the wall was airtight.

191
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:36,256
But their floors had holes.

192
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,916
And the fish in them wouldn’t spoil.

193
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:44,702
And the frozen fish inside the fish bags would be very good.

194
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:50,890
And the dry fish in them wouldn’t get mold. They’d be good.
