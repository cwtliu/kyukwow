1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,510
Turns out, we have the same name.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,370
Please speak to test it.

3
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:10,845
Okay, can you hear me?

4
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:11,920
Speak more.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,780
How?

6
00:00:12,785 --> 00:00:13,685
Any way.

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,730
Okay.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,080
I think I’m going to be coughing.

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,950
Now, start.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,640
What do you remember in your earliest memories?

11
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:37,940
Okay, growing up, my earliest memories are of downriver in Tagyaraq.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,920
(S)he’s trying ot play with that.

13
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:47,875
Don’y play with that. Look [?]... hey!

14
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:53,105
Yes, growing up, my earliest memories are in Tagyaraq.

15
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,645
Our old village there was called Quuneq.

16
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:05,055
[It was called] Quuneq.

17
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:13,885
In my earliest memores, I, you know

18
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:17,645
We used to think we were alone.

19
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:21,180
And when my mom had me go outside

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,450
I would look around, and it would seem that the world extended to our vicinity.

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,620
You know, it seemed like we were the only people. And I would think we were the only people.

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:44,210
And my older brothers would arrive seemingly from the wilderness. I thought they came from the wilderness.

23
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,810
Apparently, they’d come from our home village, Qinaq.

24
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,770
Then my mother would travel.

25
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,040
He would bring back Western things he had purchased.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:13,080
Apparently, he would go to the store owned by his male cross-cousin there in Ciun, also in Tagyaraq.

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,510
Some days, he would go.

28
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,630
When I wanted to go with him, he’d say that was going to go far away.

29
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,090
Then when I asked him, he’d say he was going to go to Eek.

30
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:34,670
It turned out, what did they call their resident Caucasian in Eek again?

31
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,940
He’d also buy Western things from there.

32
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:48,040
Then I became observant, and started going with my father.

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:59,140
We would go buy western things there in Ciun from his cousin. I would only go with him there, sometimes.

34
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:06,120
He didn’t bring me with him to other people. He wouldn’t take me though I was sad over his departure, only [took me] to the wilderness.

35
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:19,210
Then when I became observant, I had permanent long term memory.

36
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:26,700
And our fishcamp in Cuukvalegmiut, also right downriver from our old settlement

37
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,880
I also thought that place was always like that, and was in eternal summer.

38
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,000
I thought of them like that, that it was always summer there.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,940
There would be many staying there.

40
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:47,920
And I don’t think I remembered them when they left, when we moved.

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,410
Then I became observant.

42
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,640
And we went upriver.

43
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,970
Back then, the two of us would get younger siblings.

44
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,920
[My sibling] downriver and I lived as lone [siblings] for a long time.

45
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:21,700
Then right when we went upriver to Qinaq, we got a younger siblings.

46
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,130
When we’d started going to winter camp in Qurrelvak, we, you know

47
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,370
We got a younger sibling, the one downriver.

48
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,420
Then that’s how it went.

49
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,510
Then I, you know

50
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:50,780
We’d be in Qukaqlircaraq, and when we went upriver then, we would go inland to our winter camp, Qurrelvak.

51
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,650
But when a school was built in 19...

52
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:05,090
When thye started going to school in 1951 downriver at Tuntutuliak

53
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,810
We stopped being nomadic ever since then.

54
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,570
But we would also be told

55
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,770
And our father used to instruct us like this:

56
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:30,380
"Always clean off debris in the house. Clean everything, the floors.

57
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,820
"And though things feel gross, dump them out."

58
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,240
He also said to think as we dumped them

59
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,790
That we want to be good hunter-gatherers, or live long, or live well without getting sick.

60
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:55,610
Or, he also said to put the debris in our front flounces and take them out.

61
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:02,330
He said to pu tthem here in the front flounce, and take them out.

62
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:10,210
Look, he said, back then, the people who wanted to have light

63
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:16,330
Those ones who wanted to have light would always clean up

64
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,740
The ones he said wanted to be spiritually pure.

65
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:32,710
He said that osme of those who always did that, those people wouldn’t get sick.

66
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:47,640
And on their hems, he said that though they weren’t baptized, they’d emit light from their hems, and the tips of their sleeves, and here from their neck openings.

67
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:56,000
They’d emit light like this. And though they walked around outside, it wouldn’t be too dark for them.

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,850
That’s what he used to tell us.

69
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:06,110
And those people weren’t baptized, but they knew.

70
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:14,700
Then he said that we shouldn’t be averse to the sick, but help clean them up though we get dirty.

71
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,940
He said that impurities do not affect people.

72
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,870
He said that a person who serves does not become impure.

73
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:38,780
But even though those around him are sick, (s)he will not get sick.

74
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,410
There you have it.

75
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:48,210
Then, those who serve

76
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:56,370
You know, cleaning skins though they get dirty

77
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:05,580
He said they come off with washing, but they don’t stick to a person.

78
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,920
Well...

79
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Then these bowls

80
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,150
These bowls, you know, always wash things.

81
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:28,550
They would also always discard food scraps where they wouldn’t be tread upon.

82
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:42,410
Also, all of us are forgetting much traditional wisdom.

83
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:52,470
And we, we Yupiit, have forgotten the traditional Yup’ik wisdom.

84
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,010
We’ve forgotten them.

85
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:02,920
Then like this

86
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:10,690
Recently, I also heard someone from Napakiak speaking.

87
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,530
And I remembered the traditional wisdom passed down to me like this:

88
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,920
Try to have that person remember, try to have them remember.

89
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,260
My father also used to tell us this:

90
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,730
"Though they know them, they always tell them to have them remember."

91
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:44,160
That’s why he said we should never tire of traditional wisdom or our instructors, but we must listen to them, watching their mouths.

92
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:55,460
They also used to tell me this, because I was woefully bad

93
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:03,750
Since I was woefully bad, they would tell me what was apparently traditional wisdom

94
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,570
"A person has a very good appearance."

95
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,490
And wood, what that person from Napakiak was talking about.

96
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,590
Wood is not only used for jealousy.

97
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:28,630
He said that a person has a very good appearance, very nice to look, cute as you call it.

98
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:36,400
However, he said that a man may come upong a great [looking] piece of wood.

99
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,920
"What a great piece of wood."

100
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,970
He said he will split that good piece of wood, and the inside will be all twisted.

101
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:58,480
He said that a person, all of us people with bad minds are like that.

102
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:07,190
Also, a man or a woman is like that.

103
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:17,240
Then he said one may come across a very twisted piece of wood, the wood all twisted.

104
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,230
He said it looks like a bad piece of wood.

105
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:32,500
Then he said one will try to split it open to find that only the outside is twisted, and the inside is good and straight.

106
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:40,490
He said that though a person is ugly, has an ugly face, and is like that twisted piece of wood

107
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:52,160
He said that if (s)he has a good mind, they are like that twisted piece of wood with the straight grained inside, very good on the inside.

108
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:00,360
Then a straight piece of wood looks good, like it’ll be a good piece of wood

109
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,290
He said they’d try to split it open, and the inside would be all twisted.

110
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,140
He said that’s what a person is also like.

111
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:17,150
Though they look lovely, have a good face, [acts] good, or seems good like this

112
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:23,840
He said that the inside of a person with a bad mind is like that.

113
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,180
Because of that

114
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,780
These are things we must remember.

115
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:41,480
Also, do not treat people badly.

116
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,970
They’re different, and their minds are different like that piece of wood.

117
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,040
Apparently, we people are like wood.

118
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,440
I was also told that.

119
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:04,530
Since I was pitifully twisted and bad, I would hear traditional wisdom.

120
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,960
Then when they would tell me that

121
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:15,860
I would sometimes ask, "Why? Why is one like that?"

122
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,940
They said a person is like that.

123
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,930
They said one with a good appearance looking straight, has twisted insides.

124
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,290
All of them like that

125
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:40,580
The ones [who look] good, and the ones who look bad though their appearances look twisted, have good insides when they have good minds.

126
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,310
Those are the things we must remember.

127
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,420
Also

128
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:59,400
Though a person does anything to us, we shouldn’t retort.

129
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:07,220
And we shouldn’t defend ourselves, and not think that we’re good people.

130
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:14,450
And as we walk here, we should never think we’re better than those around us

131
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:20,460
But remember our own faults.

132
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:27,190
But also, we should remember our own faults

133
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:37,370
And do not stop interacting with people because of our faults.

134
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,340
Evidently, we must live socializing with other people.

135
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:51,790
Then we would also be told this:

136
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:58,000
They said that when we go out

137
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:04,010
They said that right when we go out, we should look in the middle of the [Spirit of the] Universe.

138
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,860
They said that the Spirit of the Universe is grateful by nature.

139
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:19,560
They said to always check the weather, always look around, including at the navigation stars.

140
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,640
Then people also used the sun to measure time.

141
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:33,510
And back when I started using these clocks

142
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,910
My father, you see, never used clocks, only the sun.

143
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:45,840
Then after coming in from outside, after he went out and came in, he would say

144
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,220
"It’s noon. It’s time to eat."

145
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,940
I would look at my clock and find that it was noon, yet he never saw a clock.

146
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:05,710
Then sometimes, when the sun appeared in the windows, he would say, "It’s one o’clock."

147
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,360
I would look at my clock and find it would be one o’clock.

148
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,610
It can also be used to measure time by watching how it moves.

149
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:26,760
That is clear to them, and confusing for us.

150
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:38,780
Though thye seem confusing, those who are observant do that.

151
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:46,930
When I recently heard that, when I heard that

152
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,740
I remember how I was told this

153
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,440
About what a person should do.

154
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,410
Then they also used to tell me

155
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:07,110
Though these are shameful and embarrassing, they must be told.

156
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,840
You see, they must be told.

157
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:18,240
Then they would also speak to them though they were very shameful [topics].

158
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,670
Then they used to tell me

159
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,290
I forgot what I was going to say.

160
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:42,510
You know, when I had too hard of a time

161
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:50,720
After I struggled too much, I apologize, I sometimes forget what I’m going to say.

162
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,120
But also, though one struggles with mental health

163
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,730
Though people struggle with mental health

164
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,700
We must remember them.

165
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,710
I just said, I was just speaking about to say that, and I forgot

166
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:23,260
When I struggled a lot, since they were all my relatives who passed away last winter over the course of one week.

167
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,650
But let us have this mindset

168
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,910
Though we struggle, all people experience it.

169
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,790
All people experience it.

170
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:46,140
And a person shouldn’t think they’re the only one, since all people struggle with mental health

171
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,910
Sometimes having great troubles.

172
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,670
Also, this was said, people said this:

173
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:10,270
They said that one who thinks they’re alone become severely depressed, until eventually they go insane.

174
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:18,890
They said it’s because he thinks like this: "I am the only one struggles with mental health."

175
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:25,420
However, all people in the world suffer here.

176
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:35,250
That’s why we should think that we’re the only ones struggling with mental health.

177
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:47,800
Instead, we should remember others with mental health problems, but pray for the ones who are also struggling with mental health like us.

178
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:56,470
Now, some days, a day comes where it is very hard.

179
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:02,180
You call it, having a hard time with your mental health.

180
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,670
That’s what that is.

181
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,020
Now, let’s not think we’re the only ones who think that.

182
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,660
Instead, let all of us people consider each other

183
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,750
And let us consider each other in prayer.

184
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,220
This is all from me.

185
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:41,160
Like that [?].

186
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,800
Since I have nothing to say

187
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,290
Since it was all I had to say, I talked about that.

188
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,510
Its mouth. Its mouth.

189
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:49,190
Oh my, you’re late and ended up fixing the camera for the dog.
