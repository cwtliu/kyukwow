1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,700
Annabelle Olik, Kwethluk, Iiguaq in Yup’ik.

2
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:16,565
So first, are you originally from Kwethluk?

3
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:22,700
I’m not originally from Kwethluk. I’m from Nanvarnarrlak; I’m from the Akula region.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,610
I see.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:35,520
Now, please tell me old stories of when you wen to spring camp when you were a girl.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,730
Were they fun?

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,930
The wilderness was fun.

8
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:52,445
When I was a little girls, when I was small but before I was orphaned, I used to live in the Akula region.

9
00:00:52,445 --> 00:01:04,140
Then those [times], I don’t know what it was like when I was small

10
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,650
Because I was orphaned when I was small.

11
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:17,250
You see, I have early memories of them taking to Taklirrlak over there in the spring.

12
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,175
You know Taklirrlak?

13
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:25,000
To Taklirrlak over there, in the small river there.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,930
And there were people in our hometown, this Beaver family.

15
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,580
Anguksuar and family’s parents were always with us.

16
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,800
Before I started hunting back then

17
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:58,180
These men would travel to hunt muskrats.

18
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:06,725
They would bring home various things, land otters, or beavers, or birds.

19
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,650
And when I observed my late parent

20
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:23,520
When I went walking with him, walking behind him, he would go periodically waiting for me.

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,310
And when we reached a creek, he would take out the fish trap.

22
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,280
He would take them out and they’d be filled with blackfish.

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,020
Then he’d put them in his reed bag for fish.

24
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:43,425
After setting it once again, he’d go home.

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,820
When he went home, I’d also go behind him, occassionally tripping.

26
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:55,975
Because I was weak, I would trip.

27
00:02:56,035 --> 00:03:03,830
Then when he arrived, if he didn’t cook them, he’d thread them through to make [?nuutekat].

28
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:13,370
There were so many of the fish he cut, loche, blackfish.

29
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:18,310
Because they also hung their excess birds.

30
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,920
And they’d set drift nets down there in the water next to them.

31
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:32,090
Also, there are only loche over there, you see. It doesn’t have salmon.

32
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:41,600
The only fish are loch and blackfish over there, over from Tegyaraq.

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,020
Then I would also go with him when he traveled.

34
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:56,825
He would go the the banks of Taklirrlak to a shallow place.

35
00:03:56,825 --> 00:04:00,215
He would do this with wood.

36
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:05,495
Many little snares would be like this.

37
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,140
They call them negarat.

38
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:11,990
I would watch him inland from him.

39
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:17,830
Those three of what he called negarat [snares], those wooden sticks.

40
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:24,275
Those kinds of little snares like this, snares.

41
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:30,215
Then he’d skin the bird.

42
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,930
He’d skin it, and leave the wings in place.

43
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:43,365
He stuck a piece of wood, then after filling it with moss, he’d put it between those.

44
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:50,980
Then when he would check on them somewhere, I’d always go with him.

45
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:58,370
Then we would come to them from inland

46
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:07,060
There were so many flapping their wings in three [snares] like this.

47
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,650
These parts were stuck [in the ground] like this.

48
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:14,330
Here were the snares.

49
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:21,120
There’d be so many long-tailed ducks, black scoters caught in them.

50
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,700
They were drawn to that bird decoy down there.

51
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:34,765
He would wade to them, take them out, and [snap] their necks.

52
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,450
After he removed them, he’d [snap] their necks.

53
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:47,085
He would stick them into his belt here.

54
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:53,015
Then when they’d amassed, he’d go inland, then take others off.

55
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:57,890
Then when there were no more, he’d reset the snares.

56
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,270
He’d reset them, then leave them.

57
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,950
His reed bag [filled] with birds

58
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:15,320
He would come home with it filled full with long-tailed ducks, black scoters, and probably greater scaups.

59
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,910
Women would also subsist back when I first became observant.

60
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,760
They weren’t sedentary.

61
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:34,520
When they arrived, they’d work on their chores, plucking feathers, or butchering them, or threading and hanging those little blackfish.

62
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:40,815
In the spring, though it was spring, people back then would work on so many fish.

63
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:50,105
They’d even hunt muskrats to earn money, since it was their only source of income in the spring.

64
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:59,255
When they became pregnant

65
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:07,160
When muskrats were in early pregnancy, they’d return to their villages.

66
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,710
They’d go home again, ending their spring camping.

67
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,330
Then when their spring camps were over and they arrived in their villages

68
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:24,885
After staying for a while, after putting away those fish they worked on, they’d go down to the Kuskokwim.

69
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:31,675
They’d stay downriver in Bethel.

70
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:43,625
At your mother’s grandma’s, since their late grandma was her sister, we’d stay there all summer.

71
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:45,425
How was that?

72
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:59,370
So, as you just spoke, you said that you were from Nanvarnarrlak.

73
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,020
Where there a lot of old settlements around there?

74
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,020
Were there a lot of people? No?

75
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:14,735
There weren’t a lot of settlements. There weren’t a lot of houses.

76
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:18,550
They were numbered.

77
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:25,370
To me, when I ponder and imagine them

78
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:31,515
There’d probably be a little over ten houses.

79
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:38,195
They weren’t, you know, heavily populated. No village was heavily populated.

80
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:44,030
Only Nunacuarmiut inland from us had a large population.

81
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:51,450
And Nunapitchuk had few people.

82
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,865
Paingarmiut also had few people.

83
00:08:55,865 --> 00:09:02,795
They were just upriver from around Atmauthluak inland.

84
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:10,175
Their settlements were like this: Nunacuarmiut, Nanvarnarrlagmiut, Nunapicuarmiut

85
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:18,410
And Atmauthuak was in their river.

86
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,550
There were four villages like this, but they weren’t heavily populated.

87
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,270
They weren’t heavily populated.

88
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,560
Their houses were all traditional. Their houses were made of sod.

89
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:39,265
I would see log houses like this either.

90
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:49,195
My parents were the only ones with a log house in my earliest memories, and they had a sod entry porch.

91
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:51,815
That’s what they were like.

92
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:06,840
What about these? Rivers and creeks inland have names.

93
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:14,735
And now, some of us young people forgot their names.

94
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:18,125
Do you know their names? Can you say them?

95
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:23,835
You know, some speak of Kakeggluk [Mucus] and others.

96
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:34,225
You see, since I left the Akula region before I learned it, I don’t know the [names of land and water] of the Akula region.

97
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:36,695
I don’t know them. (I see.)

98
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:39,905
You know, though I lived there

99
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:51,455
When I was a little girl like this before I grew up, when both of my parents passed away at the same time

100
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:59,135
I went down downriver.

101
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:08,495
But those two downriver who passed away, the mother and daughter took care of me.

102
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:27,440
Where did you first see a Caucasian, a Russian?

103
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,360
Where did you first see a Caucasian, and were you scared then?

104
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:42,525
I wasn’t afraid. They said the first one we saw was Angliluaqalleq.

105
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:47,485
Angliluaqall[eq], who was (s)he?

106
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:51,880
He would roam anwhere inland.

107
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,760
Maybe Angliluaqalleq. I don’t know. Who was (s)he again?

108
00:11:57,765 --> 00:12:00,895
I’ve forgotten their name.

109
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:07,770
(S)he spoke Yup’ik, but (s)he was Caucasian like this.

110
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,970
(S)he would travel to various villages like this.

111
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:14,485
After spending the night, (s)he’d leave.

112
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:18,340
And though it was dangerous, (s)he always traveled.

113
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,160
(S)he had a kayak like this with two cockpits.

114
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:26,785
Those were their only storage places.

115
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:33,410
I wasn’t afraid of them. I wasn’t afraid when I first saw a Caucasian.

116
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:41,995
That was the first one I saw inland in the spring, the one who always traveled in the spring.

117
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,360
But downriver after that, I also used to see

118
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:57,855
Those first, the firs missionaries:

119
00:12:57,855 --> 00:13:09,475
Kil’pak, Kil’piit, Qakineq, and that one they called Hincia.

120
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:15,070
Those and Puciinaaq were the first ones I saw.

121
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,940
There weren’t a lot of Caucasians downriver in Bethel.

122
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:27,350
And since Yupiit are good at giving names, every Caucasians, all of what Caucasians there were had Yup’ik names.

123
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,160
What names did they have?

124
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:37,595
Some were called [?Rare Cooked].

125
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:40,615
What else again?

126
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:49,095
Even Wrinkled from Soaking, and other things.

127
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:53,745
Some were even Small Bugs.

128
00:13:57,615 --> 00:14:05,355
People back then who’ve passed on had silly names.

129
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:14,730
They would call them random things, even some were Seal Oil Containers.

130
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:33,405
Then the traditional wisdom people passed down to these young people.

131
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:40,435
You know, you sometimes watch on TV elders giving instruction.

132
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:48,090
They make videos like this about various Yup’ik wisdom.

133
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:54,860
Should we young people not forget those?

134
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:05,950
Indeed, we remember the traditional wisdom, our traditional wisdom.

135
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:10,050
We don’t always forget them.

136
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:17,570
It’s like our young people these days can’t do it anymore.

137
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:29,055
You see, when we were girls back then, they would give us admonishments.

138
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:35,595
And they told us not to fight each other, and treat each other with love.

139
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:41,700
And though those around us look unpleasing

140
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:53,720
You know, they told us not to treat them badly, or reject them.

141
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:58,735
Instead, they told us to treat them with compassion and love.

142
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:11,335
This too: they said that if someone says something bad to us while we’re outside like this, we shouldn’t reply.

143
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,100
They told us not to reply.

144
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,960
The traditional wisdom passed down to us now

145
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:25,505
And if we become women, if we become women like this

146
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:34,490
You hear about those becoming women when these little girls become women like this.

147
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,510
They told us to be careful.

148
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:46,230
They also told us not to gravitate to boys.

149
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:54,820
Watch, they said, if a boy notices us, he will become abnormal.

150
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,800
We lived in fear of that.

151
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:08,680
We would only play by ourselves and with our fellow girls.

152
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:14,410
These boys

153
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,860
At least when we grow up

154
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:24,290
Though we play with each other when we’re small like this, nothing happens to them.

155
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:30,640
But when they’d [?grown], they’d admonish against that.

156
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:40,500
They would admonish us women against interacting with a boy.

157
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:49,680
Watch, they said, he would become abnoramal, until eventually he becomes abominable.

158
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,280
They said it’s because a woman is death.

159
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:58,695
This is what they’d tell us.

160
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:12,765
These days, these young people, children, are going to school, and many have started speaking English.

161
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:19,400
And when spoken to, some youth do not understand, don’t know what they’re being told.

162
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:25,605
Is it unbeneficial to lose the Yup’ik language?

163
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:37,240
Indeed, it’s unbeneficial for our grandchildren [to lose] that Yup’ik language.

164
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:46,295
My grandchildren, since I don’t speak English, since I don’t always speak English

165
00:18:46,295 --> 00:18:50,645
I always speak to them in Yup’ik.

166
00:18:50,645 --> 00:19:00,740
They do understand, but they can’t understand some of it.

167
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,180
All of them understand when spoken to [in Yup’ik].

168
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:15,540
But sometimes, when asked to do something, they don’t know what to take.

169
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:25,420
And when asked for something that is specifically said, they don’t know what they’re asked for.

170
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:38,540
But many of my granchildren here, since I always speak to them, they know much of the language.

171
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:46,620
But I don’t like it when these Yupiat, Yupiat like this

172
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:57,665
A married Yup’ik couple, and this is not half, and their spouse or wife or mother or grandmother is not half

173
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:08,850
Always speaking to them in English, speaking English from when they’re small, I don’t like that.

174
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:22,935
Then when they’re spoken to like this, they stay still unable to do anything.

175
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:25,470
They can’t understand anything.

176
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:34,560
Without speaking English to them like this, Yup’ik at home, if they speak to them in Yup’ik at their home

177
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,910
They will always speak Yup’ik.

178
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:45,390
Then when they go to school, they will learn in English.

179
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:49,810
Look at how they raised you

180
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:57,950
All of you know it, and you know your fellow boys here.

181
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:06,850
They have no problems speaking Yup’ik, speaking English. They have no problems.

182
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:17,950
These days, however, our children’s children have a problem.

183
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:20,575
They’re [situation] is bad to me.

184
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,210
Well, we’ve run out of time.

185
00:21:27,215 --> 00:21:29,565
Okay, well then, thank you.

186
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:31,600
Yes, thank you very much.

187
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,740
Though I’m inarticulate. (No, it’s good.)

188
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:45,265
Henry Young also says, you see, that one Caucasian was named Milt Sac.

189
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:49,400
And Milt Sac, oh my, I forgot about Milt Sac.

190
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,750
Milt Sac, that dear Caucasian, was very pale.

191
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,710
He had no [color], no blush.

192
00:21:57,715 --> 00:22:03,245
Like this, (s)he was as pale as that church over there.

193
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:06,145
Here, I’ll take that. (Okay.) Thank you.

194
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:07,365
You’re welcome.
