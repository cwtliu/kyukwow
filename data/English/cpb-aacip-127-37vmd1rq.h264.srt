1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,420
Saying she became an old woman.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,060
They say that they don’t call those who walk by themselves old men and women.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:14,930
Instead, they call them older men and women.

4
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:22,825
We who know about our ancestors’ traditional wisdom will not hold them back

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,180
Because they live long lives on this earth.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,100
Do wish early deaths upon our people whom we love?

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,420
If we love them, we must especially tell them about our ancestors traditional instructions.

8
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:55,887
And then, we Yupiit have instructions to wholeheartedly welcome our fellow peoples without discriminating against them, but in accordance with them.

9
00:00:56,349 --> 00:01:06,024
Everyone in Alaska is asked to stand with one mind with each other.

10
00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:19,443
Some people say this about part of our beliefs: "Our traditionals beliefs are good and powerful."

11
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:24,131
That’s not the case. That’s now how it is.

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,738
We should not destroy our ancestors’ sense of community and should not get rid of it.

13
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:39,513
Our ancestors say that our ancient sense of community is a form of love.

14
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:49,207
If we do not practice love in our lives here, how will we be saved? We have no other salvation.

15
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:55,369
Our ancestors practiced live, and they were saved as they continued

16
00:01:55,413 --> 00:02:01,676
Because they practiced that with all of their fellow people without discrimination.

17
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:12,151
Even if various other religions try to divide us, discrimination is bad, and leads to unrest.

18
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:24,333
But if we use our ancestors sense of community, we will live in peace, and our faith will be complete

19
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:28,258
And we will be saved through that love.

20
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:40,808
We must make our descendants especially be knowledgable about these, including how to take care of our land.

21
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:48,621
We who know the traditional wisdom should not hide them.

22
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:52,721
You see, they said that our ancestors were like this:

23
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:05,128
They said that a young boy would wake up in the community house in the dark to an old man already speaking about how a person should live life right.

24
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:19,753
In the same way out in the houses, they said that an old woman would be speaking in the dark so that those she loved would wake up to traditional wisdom and teachings.

25
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:25,472
Do we do that? We haven’t done that.

26
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:34,028
We should bring up what our ancestors were like to our descendants.

27
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:40,685
We have no other salvation. We only have salvation through community.

28
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:48,735
Jesus came down only to complete community to everywhere on earth.

29
00:03:49,192 --> 00:04:04,704
Let us know this: that sense of community will teach us how to live well, be strong, and live long lives.

30
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:10,667
It is a great thing how our ancestors stood as a community.

31
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:18,324
Even if they say that other religions are superior, do not believe them.

32
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:29,443
The one God has no superior, no one greater, and cannot be despised. He is as he always was.

33
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:40,050
We believe in one god and to Jesus to whom there is no one greater, no one higher, and no one stronger.

34
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,088
He is as he is.

35
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:52,813
For that reason, let us Yupiit instate community, especially among our descendants.

36
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:57,339
A young person is like this these days:

37
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:09,877
When he learns to speak English, he is proud thinking of himself as knowledgable, yet he does not know how to live, and he does not know what is in store for him.

38
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:26,252
Now, we must provide these for our young people so that they will know about our ancestors’ lives, especially about their sense of community.

39
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:32,990
This is all I’m saying even though it’s not a lot. Thank you.
