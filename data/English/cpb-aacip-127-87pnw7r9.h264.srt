1
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,120
First, please say your Yup’ik name and your age.

2
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:18,475
I am from Kwigillingok.

3
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:24,015
My Yup’ik name is Miisaq. They call me Miisaq

4
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:29,605
And in English, Milton M. Lewis.

5
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:32,575
When and where were you born?

6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,480
I was born in Kwigillingok. I was born in Kwigillingok.

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,200
How old are you now?

8
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:47,315
Going by my [birth] certificate that came from Juneau, I am 74 years old.

9
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:55,015
First, please talk about how they celebrated Thanksgiving when you were growing up.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:05,340
You see, when I was growing up as a boy, the people that I was born in time to see didn’t know about Thanksgiving.

11
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:10,440
I grew up without Thanksgiving.

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:22,720
Only when we started having, you know, priests in Kwigillingok

13
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:26,465
That’s when they first shared Thanksgiving.

14
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,450
How did they celebrate Thanksgiving in the beginning?

15
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:38,705
When they first started, when they about how it first started

16
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:43,815
One of the priests, I think it was Didmer

17
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:52,425
They said that those who were captives from across the ocean, somewhere far away

18
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:56,960
In their captivity, they crossed the ocean.

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,760
You know, those who are captives do not live very comfortably.

20
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:07,145
They kept getting into unfortunate circumstanes.

21
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:11,145
Then they crossed the ocean.

22
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:19,270
When they landed safely, they then planted crops.

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,250
They [harvesteed] those crops they started.

24
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,630
That is when they started this Thanksgiving celebration.

25
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:39,705
You know, how God took care of them even though they greatly sufferen in captivity.

26
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:48,205
Escpecially those crops that they grew, that God allowed to grow

27
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:54,705
Out of gratitude for their food, they started this Thanksgiving celebration.

28
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,070
During Thanksgiving, what kinds of traditional wisdom or admonishments would you hear?

29
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,940
Now you may start.

30
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,255
About traditional wisdom.

31
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:19,265
During Thanksgiving, when they would bring that up, when they spoke about it

32
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:27,485
To those who know about Thanksgiving, we must give thank to God as they did.

33
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:31,880
You know, we must be thankful for everything.

34
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,380
I realized afterwards when I pondered upon it

35
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:47,755
We must thank God for all of the ways he cares for us.

36
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:57,305
Until this year, what kind admonishments and traditional wisdom did you hear when you were growing up?

37
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:05,205
When I was growing up, I used to hear things aside from Thanksgiving

38
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:13,215
But especially for us, you know, Yupiit, what our ancestors were like.

39
00:04:13,215 --> 00:04:18,585
Here is one piece of traditional wisdom I used to hear

40
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:28,635
When I listen to people telling stories like this here on KYUK

41
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:34,075
What our ancestors were like back then, you know, their traditional wisdom

42
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:45,220
It seems that I haven’t heard one thing I used to hear. They probably talk about when I wasn’t listening, when I sometimes don’t listen.

43
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,820
They’ve started doing it now.

44
00:04:48,825 --> 00:05:01,055
I am thankful especially for that important thing that I used to hear

45
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,195
It’s important for us boys

46
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:14,820
I want to speak about that traditional wisdom I used to hear when we were boys, and I’m thankful that you asked.

47
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:21,115
A boy a long time ago, we had this piece of traditional wisdom:

48
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,530
They say that a boy especially scatters [out of the home] when it’s time.

49
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:36,250
They also said that a lot of people have now started doing this

50
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:43,145
You know, boys marry people who are not from the same village.

51
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:46,440
Our ancestors back then say they move to another village.

52
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,750
That that piece of wisdom I used to hear is important

53
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:02,850
If a boy moves to another village, they would especially warn us boys about this:

54
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:16,600
They said that if we move to another village aside from our own where we didn’t grow up, we should live carefully if we move to another village.

55
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:25,440
We should try not to give, you know, sow discord in this village.

56
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,610
You know, this was the thing they especially admonished against:

57
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:45,099
Try not to sow discord among your peers, your fellow people, those who go through life with you there where it is not your [home] village.

58
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:54,868
They said that if you do not heed that, if you give reason for commotion where it’s not your [home] village

59
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:08,630
That village will look for your parents. "Did his parents not teach him when he was a boy?“

60
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:17,774
They said that they would especially talk about that without my knowledge if I give that village that is now my own reason for commotion.

61
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:29,018
These days, I think that people don’t hear that traditional wisdom since then

62
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:37,631
The important traditional wisdom that if a person moves to another village aside from his own that he should be careful.

63
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:43,388
He should try not to sow discord in this village.

64
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:56,032
Or more importantly, that he should take something of from the people that he’s joined and lives with that is not his own without their knowledge.

65
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:59,976
They emphasized that.

66
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:20,328
These days, I repeatedly hear about those who move to other villages that are not their own and sow discord in the village they moved into.

67
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:27,226
Then when I think about these place here, Bethel

68
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:38,244
I don’t hear too much about those who need admonishing, except for these who come from some other villages.

69
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:43,281
They sow discord.

70
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:58,716
Because back then, though some people heeded that piece of traditional wisdom, however, there have always been some who did not heed it, you know?

71
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:14,633
Even though a person, a boy, was given instruction, when he has the idea as he goes, he sows discord in that village even though he didn’t grow up there.

72
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:28,102
This was the important warning that I used to hear our elders say because boys especially, you know, move [when getting married].

73
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:33,214
Then this other one that causes commotion is important:

74
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:47,765
A boy, when we boys get married, you know, they told us to love our spouses

75
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:58,225
Because women, you know, are weaker than men, we men.

76
00:09:58,236 --> 00:10:11,550
Now, when some are not careful with their spouses, and when they follow their idea to physically abuse them

77
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:20,046
In my observation, it’s like they start a sickness in their spouses.

78
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:25,312
They say this is the reason we must be careful with our spouses.

79
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:41,502
Should they, you know, go before us, they tell them to be careful with their spouses so that they would not be filled with regret.

80
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:56,562
These days, I hear that even though they take spouses that are not from their villages

81
00:10:56,577 --> 00:11:01,292
Though they take spouses from other villages

82
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:15,634
They do not heed that and beat their spouses whom they are supposed to love, whom they are supposed to love as themselves.

83
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:20,357
You know, let me move to this subject.

84
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:32,213
When we get marrid, we are supposed to love and agree with our spouses as ourselves.

85
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:40,776
They said that if we love our spouses, we will love ourselves, we men, their spouses.

86
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:45,832
They’ve started doing it, especially these days.

87
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:53,524
When they are not careful with their spouses, they start sicknesses in them.

88
00:11:53,534 --> 00:12:02,706
And this sickness cannot, you know, it has no medicine when it spreads.

89
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:09,408
Before it spread, doctos now [treat] them.

90
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:18,432
But for us these days, as I ponder upon it

91
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:23,235
We must be careful with our spouses in our relationship

92
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:37,594
Because unintentionally, you know, if we treat them harshly and physically abuse them, we will start a sickness in them.

93
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:53,910
Especially for this reason now, since I’ve never heard it on KYUK when elders tell stories and give instructions on what they used to hear back then

94
00:12:53,927 --> 00:13:03,699
Wanting to put my thought somewhere, I wanted to talk about it

95
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:11,808
Just in case that the ones who will stand after us might remember it if they hear it.

96
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,577
Lastly, please say something you are thankful for this year.

97
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:23,853
Now, I have something I’m thankful for as we come to this Thanksgiving season.

98
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:36,798
Recently last summer in the month of August, I would be sick in the past.

99
00:13:36,812 --> 00:13:41,212
My back would suffer.

100
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:55,718
But at the beginning of August, I was more sick then ever before, sweat gushing out of my body, and my hair would be [soaked] with sweat.

101
00:13:56,366 --> 00:14:02,595
It turned out that I had gotten stones in my internal organs inside.

102
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:11,221
I would certainly have been incapacitated had they not found those in the hospital.

103
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:21,065
That is what I’m most thankful to God for during this Thanksgiving season

104
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:31,752
Because even though I was like that, he has allowed me to live to see this day, this day.

105
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:39,695
Because it truly seems that these doctors are [the work of] God’s arms

106
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:43,875
And because our prayers are answered through that.

107
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:53,433
We pray for those around us, and they are helped with these doctors and nurses.

108
00:14:53,456 --> 00:15:04,499
I had gone through that when they were going to perform surgery because I had been suffering so much when I was sick.

109
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:17,911
It would have been good for me had I not awoken [alive] because they were going to anesthetize me for surgery because I was suffering so much.

110
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,546
Then I immediately changed my mind.

111
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:35,549
Let me pray to God, and let me give these doctors and nurses to God.

112
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:43,680
If it was not my time, I asked him to help me through them.

113
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:52,666
Then I immediately said prayed about several things to God when they were preparing to perform surgery on me here.

114
00:15:54,049 --> 00:16:05,149
"These people," I said this, praying a short prayer: "Jesus come and be with us.

115
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:11,830
"And bless these doctors and nurses."

116
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:16,241
That was all I prayed for.

117
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:23,413
Then God heard my request.

118
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:29,029
And my ailments that they removed from inside

119
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:41,224
The doctor told me wife in there when they were finished with me that they had removed 80 or 90 stones from my intenal organs.

120
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:46,128
Afterwards, I gave great praise to God in my mind.

121
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:53,593
This is what I’m most thankful for in this Thanksgiving season.

122
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:55,211
Thank you.

123
00:16:55,218 --> 00:16:56,304
You’re welcome.

124
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,792
There were so many stones.

125
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,444
[?Don’t tell me I smiled.]
