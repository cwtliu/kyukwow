1
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:23,070
And then, because we people are not the same

2
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:39,037
Since we are not the same, it will be like some people do not see and do not hear what they have said.

3
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:47,822
They would talk like that about a person who is like that.

4
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:55,728
They said that in the future, he will not be Cup’ik, will not be Cup’ik.

5
00:00:56,472 --> 00:01:07,984
However, they would closely aboserve the one who followed their traditional wisdom who is inside that community house.

6
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:20,660
They said that one who closely follows traditional wisdom like this would live for a long time.

7
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:30,367
They say that it will be as if his breath squats down [?stays] if he is obedient

8
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:38,436
And he does not put down those around him, and he doesn’t talk down to those around him.

9
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:49,842
Those who spoke would tell that person to treat everyone the same, even if they’re young or small.

10
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:26,386
All of them would tell me that if I am a bad person, and if I disregard children after [?receiving money for them]

11
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:31,905
My husband would consider my behavior and leave me.

12
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:44,599
And then men also, they said that if a man is too mischievous

13
00:02:44,837 --> 00:02:59,037
They leave those who do not take advice when they also disregard children after [receiving money for them].

14
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:06,806
And then they scatter and are unable to take husbands.

15
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:12,862
And then a man can’t take a wife since people know about him.

16
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:49,850
We also hear about these things, our food, and what we women sew into clothes, that no one will do it for us.

17
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:52,319
They said we must work for them ourselves.

18
00:03:52,557 --> 00:04:05,220
If our child has bad behavior like that, and is disobedient, and a liar, no one out there will take care of that for us.

19
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,432
We will only do it ourselves.

20
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:20,320
Yupiit back then have traditional wisdom concerning boys.

21
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:24,358
They say that a boy is able to change.

22
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:31,039
They say that he will become repulsed with his life.

23
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,720
They said this, and I was especially afraid of that back when I started observing the traditional wisom.

24
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:52,014
However, they said that if a woman is like that, it is more difficult for her to change her life, her ways.

25
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:58,483
You know, if we do not try to change them [for the better] starting from when they’re small.

26
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:14,046
They said that she may change, you know, back when we didn’t choose our own husbands, when they didn’t choose their own husbands.

27
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:25,571
They said that she may change when she moves into her in-laws, but she will take upon her former ways again.

28
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:37,109
Through that, they would evidently try to teach and instruct us women from the beginning.

29
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:12,316
And then, even if they’re disobedient, or do not heed [advice] on alcohol, to talk to them.

30
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:21,779
And even if he comes to, do not treat him badly because of his alcohol use when seeing him.

31
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:35,948
Instead, show them our love. Try to let them know our love, you know, our mother’s love.

32
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:46,317
Also, do not treat him badly as he’s drunk.

33
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:56,598
Also, if he does that in our house around us, do not run from him.

34
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:05,267
He may act scary, but he will not do anything if he has no one to go against him.

35
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:20,798
Also, after he’s drunk and did something bad, you know, in that house, at least this is what I’m like.

36
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:32,967
Try not to run away from him, try not to leave him. You know, I’m more afraid of what he may do behind me.

37
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:42,599
And if one is offended, and we leave him all alone there, one of them will be offended.

38
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:49,118
Or else, he may take a weapon and try to hurt himself.

39
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:25,519
And the next day if my child had been drunk, console him the next day, and don’t scold him right away.

40
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:39,581
Console him as I did before to try to make him happy, and ask him what he’s going to do. Just that.

41
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:48,300
With his being drunk the day before, do not first bring up his anger if he had become angry.

42
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:58,263
And if had been scared, do not bring those up, but console him.

43
00:08:58,732 --> 00:09:05,107
And they say now, and I see them being hungover, yuussugluteng.

44
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:09,926
And if one of them is hungover, he seems to be irritable.

45
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:24,645
Only when he stops that and starts having fun, starts doing things, when he can speak well, well, he doesn’t seem to be able to speak well when he’s hungover.

46
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:35,445
And when he starts to speak well and doesn’t expect [to be scolded] anymore

47
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:43,208
Then, one should talk to him about what had happened the previous day.

48
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:48,614
And do not scold him, but speak kindly to him.

49
00:09:48,683 --> 00:10:00,933
Explain to him, clearly explain to him how you were scared and how you would leave your fear without scolding him.

50
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:09,215
One of them will be very regretful then.

51
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:16,846
He will regret it. And tell him you love him, and show him your love.

52
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:48,302
They would instruct us on hooks for dragging caught seals that they put on gaffs. You seem to know it. (Yes.)

53
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:55,890
They said that if we travel in the ocean, to keep that hook in possession without leaving it behind.

54
00:10:55,909 --> 00:11:03,771
If we go somewhere or go to look from a vantage point, we shouldn’t leave it, but use it as a staff.

55
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:17,959
With his potential to get into misfortune, when he takes that gaff along with him, that [saves] him.

56
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:30,416
One day, my grandfather, my father’s father, went to look from a high vantage point where it was a little shallow.

57
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:42,416
As he was looking around from up there holding that, they started caving.

58
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:53,879
When that happened and he also wend down, as they were [?crumbling], he did this with his gaff.

59
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:58,873
He hung on to that, and didn’t go into the water.

60
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:06,542
That has also saved me twice.

61
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:11,779
That is the instruction on the gaff, the instruction.

62
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:21,544
The other time, when I was going to go in as it collapsed under me, that gaff pulled me out.

63
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:39,425
Also, when I was traveling with thinner ice in my path, had I not had that in my possession when it was snowy, if I sunk, I would have fell in right away.

64
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:50,125
That’s also the instruction concerning that. I did this and it kept me from sinking.

65
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:26,824
When this money is gathered, it’s good when it’s gathered there

66
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:37,975
To things he need to use, [culukarkat], or boats as it’s gathered, if he gives it to help a person.

67
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:53,424
That’s why these days, when a person is paid, that money makes it make or break for them now.

68
00:13:53,899 --> 00:14:07,437
When a person gets money, for the ones I see outside, getting drunk is the most important for them.

69
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:23,987
If he uses it the wrong way to get some substances, and if he travels to places where they have them, he uses it for those things.

70
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:29,787
It sometimes brings him to misfortune.

71
00:14:55,474 --> 00:15:09,324
The people who spoke on this told us that sleep and laziness keep us destitute.

72
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:10,912
Those two.

73
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:17,487
They say those two deprive people of things [they need].

74
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:31,800
But one who is knowledgeable about traditional wisdom, [raised right], a person who follows good things

75
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:40,524
The ones I saw doing that were not in need of anything too much.

76
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:50,612
They were also good hunters because they followed that good instruction.

77
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,737
There were often things up ahead for him.

78
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:07,012
When we were growing up, because we didn’t have things premade for us since we only tried to make things out of what we caught

79
00:16:07,274 --> 00:16:15,224
They would tell us that, to try to be good at hunting and catching.

80
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:31,687
They told us about that, that one who lives without being in need of anything lived as a good hunter, not a bad hunter.

81
00:16:55,212 --> 00:17:06,062
If someone works for something, especially one who works for alcohol, and even one who works for smoking

82
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:14,787
To me, it seems he must believe in something, and seek help.

83
00:17:16,712 --> 00:17:22,637
If a person has absolutely no faith, he will have no strength though he tries.

84
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:34,700
Believe one of the two. Believe in the ways of the church.

85
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:47,312
And if you cannot believe in the ways of the church, Yupiit speak things that are no different from the instructions of the church.

86
00:17:47,724 --> 00:17:54,612
Believe in Yup’ik wisdom if you do not wat the church’s ways.

87
00:17:54,887 --> 00:18:02,862
Believe in Yup’ik wisdom, try to adhere to it, and try to obey it.

88
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:17,675
A Yup’ik will not mind, you know, if person asks an elder about instructions, asks about what do to in the future.

89
00:18:17,687 --> 00:18:25,412
To me, he will be very thankful. To me, he will be very thankful if he asks him.

90
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:35,824
Even though I am not working anymore now, when people ask me, I am wholeheartedly thankful inside.

91
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:48,824
That traditional Yup’ik wisdom, especially now that I am an old lady, it seems that that Yup’ik wisdom comes to me more strongly.

92
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:54,537
It’s because they’re no different from the church’s wisdom.

93
00:18:54,674 --> 00:19:04,962
They are very strong and very good traditional wisdom to me, that Yup’ik wisdom and instruction.

94
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:41,524
When I spoke to them, I would tell them, "Since I love you, I have always refrained from drinkins because I don’t want you to feel helpless."

95
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:47,399
It’s also because they see their peers have alcoholic parents.

96
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:55,962
Also, they bring them in in shame wanting to feed them. They say their mom and daddy are drunk.

97
00:19:56,412 --> 00:20:03,349
I would be extremely thankful inside that they were compassionate.

98
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:16,287
I would them about that like that: "Since I love you, I didn’t raise you by making you feel helpeless.

99
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:33,737
"To pay me back out of great love for me, remember that I do not want you do abuse that alcohol, so keep away from it."

100
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,600
That’s what I tell them.

101
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,400
These days especially, they are getting more difficult like this:

102
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:16,900
It truly seems that these poor people are caught in the middle of Yup’ik and Western cultures

103
00:21:17,012 --> 00:21:23,562
It’s like my grandchildren here are caught between them.

104
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:34,999
But despite that, in some places here, our grandchildren, at least my grandchildren, are starting to speak only in English.

105
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:43,225
I try to speak to them around here with whatever [English] fluency I have.

106
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:52,487
It truly seems that they show that they do not want to listen, or they also indicate that they do not think they are true.

107
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,224
But even though they do that, we must try [to teach] them like that.

108
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:07,712
Especially also like that, we must not [give up] like that because they don’t want to listen.

109
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:17,324
Even if he doesn’t listen, he will someday have regrets about one that encouraged him.

110
00:22:17,374 --> 00:22:22,824
He will someday think that he was shown love.

111
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:36,474
When I was growing up, I used to think that those who taught me like that were not showing me love.

112
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,075
It turned out that they spoke to me out of love.

113
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:48,437
With that in consideration, I try to speak to them now.

114
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:22,937
These days, there are also a lot of our young people that take their own lives.

115
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,362
They end their own lives.

116
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:34,887
Or the fight and kill each other, kill their peers.

117
00:23:35,312 --> 00:23:47,937
Truly, we do not want to lose a young person, a precious young person, who takes his own life.

118
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:54,850
About our young people, we people are not the same.

119
00:23:54,862 --> 00:24:11,187
Some people are treated badly by their parents, or when they are constantly told that they are doing something wrong, they lose their will to live, not wanting to live.

120
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:28,362
And then when a person does that and starts to think of himself as bad, he considers his conflict and takes his own life.

121
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:36,662
But even if he ends it himself, he will not awake to paradise.

122
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:44,687
Instead, he will awake in a bad place that he set for himself. And it will definitely happen.

123
00:24:44,849 --> 00:25:01,137
So, no matter what our children do, let us parents not excessively blame them, as they call it, blame them and start treating them badly, but with encouragement.

124
00:25:01,662 --> 00:25:06,737
Let us only admonish them with encouragement.

125
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:18,687
It’s unfortunate these days that every young person has taken upon that way, and even those who are not young do it.

126
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:53,000
You see, there were a lot of legendary little people, and those carrying signaling gaffs would appear.

127
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:57,612
And when that one with the signaling gaff was going to reach the village, he would disappear.

128
00:25:57,787 --> 00:26:06,899
And when he disappeared beside them, there would a certain number of sleds going down to the ocean.

129
00:26:07,675 --> 00:26:16,175
After the people from this village who were at spring camp went down to the ocean, those little poeple would be ahead of them.

130
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:19,612
They were all ahead of them.

131
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:34,625
After those sleds went to the ocean, they would go inland. Their sleds were red, filled full with animals.

132
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:46,987
And then right when evening set, those sleds here would go toward the two mountains.

133
00:27:12,787 --> 00:27:21,437
Right when evening set, there would be one with a signaling gaff who was from this spring camp settlement.

134
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:30,762
And then there was a community house outside of us, a big community house, quite a big community house.

135
00:27:31,537 --> 00:27:41,274
Our grandfather, whom they said was Elnguq’s father, came and sat up there on the community house’s flooded entrance.

136
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:47,074
He kept singing to that person with the signaling gaff coming inland toward us.

137
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:56,049
And we girls and boys listened to him as we held the ones we were hugging.

138
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,099
Oh my, we eventually learned his song.

139
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:08,150
You see, he would sing like this, watching that person with the signaling gaff:

140
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:20,562
"One with signaling gaff raya-yarra-iya, aa-iya the many [?little boys]

141
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:28,299
"Spotted seal-spotted seal-spotted seal-spotted seal, bearded seal-ssiya-yarra-iya

142
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:34,087
"Aa-iya, the many [?little boys]."

143
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:39,062
We who listened to him completely learned it.

144
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:56,237
And when the one with the signaling gaff arrived, when he stood before him with intent, he stuck his gaff here and told a story.

145
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,912
He told the ones who would get them that there were things to get.

146
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:14,849
Oh my, sleds as many as the little people who had gone ahead of them would go to the ocean every day.

147
00:29:15,112 --> 00:29:21,475
It turned out that they had shown how many would go as they went ahead of them.

148
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,037
I bested a shaman in my sleep.

149
00:29:50,337 --> 00:29:54,450
I came to, let me tell you the story.

150
00:29:54,462 --> 00:30:01,362
I came to in the wilderness, sitting all by myself on the ground.

151
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:09,224
When I heard something and turned my head this way, I saw a door here.

152
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:18,750
There was a right arm approaching, constantly touching the land here.

153
00:30:19,037 --> 00:30:24,912
I thought, "My goodness, this is not something good."

154
00:30:25,812 --> 00:30:35,587
Then, before it reached me since it was a little far, I prayed as I slept down there.

155
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:47,400
I prayed for the Lord to help me, and that I knew that I had nothing that could oppose this thing that was going to reach me.

156
00:30:47,825 --> 00:30:55,137
I said that I had not the same power to oppose it, but to give me strength.

157
00:30:55,712 --> 00:31:01,150
I asked to be given strength for this.

158
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:35,712
When I was done, I opened my eyes as I was sitting with outstretched legs liek this, and my knife, my huge knife, was between my legs.

159
00:31:36,837 --> 00:31:42,162
How did that come? Despite my being in the wilderness.

160
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:46,749
I grabbed it.

161
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:52,637
When I grabbed it, I saw that it was going to reach me.

162
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:56,887
You see, I faced it head on.

163
00:31:57,037 --> 00:32:10,437
When I faced it as it was going to reach me, I knelt here and took the knife on the handle like this as an opponent.

164
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:19,537
When I opened my eyes after I had prayed, I felt different and seemed strong.

165
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:30,587
And then when the right hand came here

166
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:36,562
I did this with the knife and put it here.

167
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:45,362
It started crackeling. I shut my eyes tight as it was crackling.

168
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:50,724
You see, as it was crackling, it stuck into the ground.

169
00:32:51,337 --> 00:33:00,012
It also cried out, and it seemed that the metal was crying out as it seemed to retreat.

170
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,500
Oh my, I turned my head and the arm was gone.

171
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:37,312
They say this to us: these days, we have the breadth of mind as a fingernail.

172
00:33:37,324 --> 00:33:43,262
Our will of mind is easily destroys, and we easily go the wrong way.

173
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:53,224
Indeed, those we were born in time to see would speak to us without thinking we’d get offended.

174
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:57,737
And they would speak to us as if they really were scolding us.

175
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:09,212
One of you probably recognizes it when I say this: let us encourage each other while we do not consume alcohol.

176
00:34:10,537 --> 00:34:22,950
They would speak to us without worrying, and they would speak to us as if scolding us without thinking that we would somehow get offended.

177
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:32,600
After they had spoken to us as if they were scolding us, they would say this after when they finished:

178
00:34:32,912 --> 00:34:44,012
"The one whom a person loves... a person does not teach one he does not love no matter what they’re like or if they’re misbehaving.

179
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:52,112
"A person teaches one whom he loves as if he is scolding, without thinking he will get offended."

180
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:24,212
I grew up when alcohol was scarce, and I didn’t see anyone drunk.

181
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:32,662
And then later, before I wed, I started seeing people who would get drunk.

182
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:43,049
We’ve heard from the beginning that alcohol brings misfortune, and it is truly more powerful than sickness today.

183
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:45,512
This alcohol has become stronger.

184
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:51,262
And other things, medicine abuse is also stonger than sickness.

185
00:35:52,649 --> 00:36:01,837
Since they are facing very hard times these days, people aren’t leaving here anymore.

186
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:12,537
Instead, there are now a lot of people leaving here to abuse alcohol, marijuana, and other things like medication.

187
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:19,487
And sometimes, we hear that a lot of them gather to travel.

188
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:26,599
Oh my, it truly is not a good thing for people who abuse alcohol.

189
00:36:26,724 --> 00:36:31,199
Now, we are discussing alcohol.

190
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:34,262
This is not the first meeting I’ve attended.

191
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:41,074
When I attend meetings, we fight against alcohol.

192
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:48,262
And from what we hear, other people aside from us also fight against alcohol.

193
00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:51,687
It’s distressing because it’s a bad thing.

194
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:58,399
One who begins to abuse it cannot give it up. He cannot give it up.

195
00:36:58,462 --> 00:37:04,162
But one who tries will give it up.

196
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:09,474
And one who refrains from abusing it will stop abusing it.

197
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:42,849
You see, back when they talked about the world ending, I was born in time to see those who talked about the world ending

198
00:37:43,924 --> 00:37:51,999
Way back when they talked about a time of need, I was born in time to see those who talked about it.

199
00:37:52,387 --> 00:38:03,662
And then, you see, now I always remember what that one person said.

200
00:38:03,674 --> 00:38:12,274
And then as I always remember it now, I am wary of this world, afraid that it will end badly.

201
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:19,850
And it’s apparently not just me. Some are not wary of this world.

202
00:38:21,324 --> 00:38:36,262
When I started becoming observant back then, I noticed that some old men and old women would walk by supporting themselves with their knees, yet some could not walk anymore.

203
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:40,612
When they had old women and old men [among them].

204
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:47,924
Some would take them, bring them out of the community house, and take fire baths.

205
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:52,687
And when they were done, they would bring in those who could not walk anymore.

206
00:38:54,137 --> 00:39:00,887
Then when they spoke about the world ending, some of them said this:

207
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:12,700
"The oldest ones who had been alive under the earth, the place we heard about beneath,"

208
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:22,300
Those oldest ones said, "A person lives for a long time. He will not do so again."

209
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:25,899
They also said this:

210
00:39:26,012 --> 00:39:34,762
"Back then, you see," when they spoke about the world ending way back then,

211
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:38,924
"You see, some of these great hunters,"

212
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:48,474
That old man who was just waking in the community house, I heard him toward the door by the wall

213
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:56,562
They said that one of them got up, "Ah, it should happen already during our good time."

214
00:39:56,649 --> 00:40:00,749
Apparently, it was when the one who would get them was nigh.

215
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:10,187
Apparently, you know, they said that when people hoped for something. They said that people always hope for something.

216
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:19,012
They said that they would beg to be liberated when that time was nigh.

217
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:51,924
And back that, at that time, I also used to see those days.

218
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:56,137
It seemed they did it in one winter.

219
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:07,499
The daytime came to be, upriver where the dawn would come, going upriver toward the north.

220
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:10,662
From beautiful days, night would set.

221
00:41:10,712 --> 00:41:18,999
Some of them men would say that there are not false days. They wouldn’t offer any explanation.

222
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:27,499
And one day, we were rowdy, playing until it got dark.

223
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:35,387
I entered a house that wasn’t the house of those who had raised me.

224
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:40,187
And right when I went in, a woman came in after me.

225
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:46,437
Then when she came in, she said before she sat, "There is day out there now."

226
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:54,750
And then the old man among the people of that house, the old man said

227
00:41:54,874 --> 00:42:04,774
"When it’s time, nature does not keep its people in ignorance. Instead, you see, it gives them a sign."

228
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:19,325
He said, you see, that it gives them a sign of what it’s going to do. When it was time to teach them, looking at its people, because it’s time, looking at the people living here on the earth.

229
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:24,924
You see, he said that it is showing them what will happen to them through that.

230
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:39,999
And then he said, "You see, people will wait expectantly. You see, as they are waiting expectantly, they will wait no more, and no one left will be waiting expectantly.

231
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,824
"Also, you see, they will no longer hear anyone talking about the world ending."

232
00:42:45,837 --> 00:42:51,375
Now, we are in the time that he talked about.

233
00:42:51,499 --> 00:42:58,188
You see, he also said that there would be no snow anymore.

234
00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:02,499
In other words, when [nature] puts it into one place.

235
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:06,377
Now, I always remember what he said.

236
00:43:06,388 --> 00:43:09,355
I am not wary of this world

237
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:12,833
I actually don’t know to how far along this world is.

238
00:43:37,755 --> 00:43:40,288
They also said this.

239
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:45,699
They only talked about fish roe.

240
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:52,477
They said that this fish row will appear every year on earth.

241
00:43:52,488 --> 00:43:54,599
They said it would not change.

242
00:43:54,610 --> 00:44:03,255
They said it would not be dangerous to humans though it comes every year. That’s all they would say about it.

243
00:44:03,533 --> 00:44:08,299
And now, there are freezers.

244
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:13,177
But there are two kinds of these. There are two kinds of freezers.

245
00:44:13,288 --> 00:44:21,299
But when I think about this salted fish, it will also keep every year if it is salted right.

246
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,577
Though it takes on years, that will not spoil either.

247
00:44:25,811 --> 00:44:30,611
There are two kinds of freezers. We don’t know how far along they are.

248
00:44:31,055 --> 00:44:40,277
And these days, our Caucasian counterparts are [qagret] out there in this day.

249
00:44:40,288 --> 00:44:46,277
But as they go, we do not know what they do.

250
00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:54,588
When I think about it, you see, I’ve started hearing since quite some time ago

251
00:44:54,633 --> 00:45:06,355
The populous lands out there that I’ve never seen who do not know cold have started getting cold. It’s started getting snowy where they do not know snow.

252
00:45:06,355 --> 00:45:13,966
That is causing harm to plants, and probably to young animals.

253
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:18,333
It is also causing harm to those that were able.

254
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:30,354
The people in those lands way over there that I do not see are in heavy consideration, considering how to grow plants.

255
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:41,855
When I imagine being there, they will not turn back from their lives and value Alaska’s people.

256
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:50,554
I was also told this, I was told about this untranslated topic from someone who was knowledgeable:

257
00:45:50,777 --> 00:46:00,677
"Those who grow plants must grow plants. Those who food must go with their food."

258
00:46:00,877 --> 00:46:10,455
And then he also said this: "You see, when that time is nigh, when that false day is covered

259
00:46:10,466 --> 00:46:17,855
"You see, people will start fighting, acting crazy. They will no longer await anything."

260
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:26,689
You see how it is now, we are in that time during the current days out there.

261
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,399
They do not care about those around them anymore.

262
00:46:58,444 --> 00:47:08,133
It is also clear these days. Their grandmother does not teach.

263
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:15,488
Neither are we pitiful ones, their grandfathers, teachers in random places here.

264
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:23,955
It truly seems that the people of the next generation, it seems like we are just watching them out of fun.

265
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,844
We have no sense of discipline these days.

266
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:42,544
And when I think about it, when the world is going to change, even if it’s heading to winter, it will not tell its people what it’s going to do.

267
00:47:42,955 --> 00:47:55,288
It turns out, you see, that it would do any of them since it already showed and told its people that it would do that to them.

268
00:47:55,621 --> 00:48:00,321
And then, that old man also said this:

269
00:48:00,466 --> 00:48:14,655
"You see, when that time of starvation is close, these two, shee, Bering cisco, there will be a lot of those fish in the rivers.

270
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:16,877
"There will be a lot of those fish."

271
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:25,582
They said that if a person runs out of food, he will have one of those as a food source.

272
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:29,477
They said that he would eat one of those.

273
00:48:29,537 --> 00:48:34,247
They said that despite that, he will become skinny, his flesh will deteriorate.

274
00:48:34,257 --> 00:48:39,687
Those two fish are appropriate and good, and they are fatty.

275
00:48:39,997 --> 00:48:45,527
"Those," he said, "Those two fish are the fish during famine."

276
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:48,167
I haven’t forgotten this.

277
00:48:48,382 --> 00:48:53,182
Since I’ve been remembering it now, I’ve become wary of this world.

278
00:48:53,677 --> 00:49:05,077
Then they also said this back then: "These fish, king salmon, chum salmon, silver salmon, those do not [?]."

279
00:49:05,202 --> 00:49:12,002
That’s why, they said, the people back then passed on this traditional knowledge to the current people of our next generation:

280
00:49:12,137 --> 00:49:21,047
While those are swimming, if a person is able, he should not be lazy, but take as much as he can from them.

281
00:49:21,097 --> 00:49:26,167
They admonished them against [?] during the fall.

282
00:49:26,207 --> 00:49:36,077
They said that type of winter is going to happen, everything that comes after them will be gone.

283
00:49:36,157 --> 00:49:40,877
I always remember this now.

284
00:50:06,382 --> 00:50:15,612
They said that when famine comes upon them, I was also told about this. It’s been a while.

285
00:50:15,982 --> 00:50:26,752
It also touched my mind when the one who told me talked to me, and it also touched his mind when he said this:

286
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:37,542
He said that he dreamt that he was fishing with a drift net, drifting in the water like this. However we or you fish with drift nets.

287
00:50:37,847 --> 00:50:45,347
Then when it was time, he rolled it. As he was rolling it, a fish appeared down there.

288
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:50,662
It was [?entirely] covered in bones, yet it was moving.

289
00:50:50,817 --> 00:51:00,027
Then when it appeared, it said to the one who caught it, "Wait. I have two things to say."

290
00:51:00,317 --> 00:51:11,877
Then it said to the one who caught it, "After a few years, a famine will come.

291
00:51:11,952 --> 00:51:15,322
"Also, the spirit of theft will move."

292
00:51:15,332 --> 00:51:28,382
You see, of all the people I grew up in time to see who have always spoke, this was the first time I heard about the spirit of theft.

293
00:51:28,572 --> 00:51:40,172
Then after the person who told me that, it seems that every year, people are getting worse. They seem to get worse.

294
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:45,527
They’ve become reluctant to share with their families, even stealing food.

295
00:51:45,612 --> 00:51:55,222
When I think about the people now, if their stomachs are deprived, how far will they go?

296
00:51:55,222 --> 00:51:57,462
They will also steal from their families.

297
00:51:57,477 --> 00:52:10,047
Or, people are not like how they were before. Some have no more social inhibitions, and some have become dangerous, and some will be killed because they have food.

298
00:52:10,557 --> 00:52:14,267
It’s getting too long. That’s all for that.

299
00:52:37,307 --> 00:52:47,327
I would watch them rejecting advice, and being disobedient.

300
00:52:47,382 --> 00:52:51,492
I knew they weren’t good people.

301
00:52:51,592 --> 00:52:54,442
They covet their peers.

302
00:52:54,472 --> 00:53:04,572
They would covet those who worked and provided through their stomachs or their bodies [with ragged clothes]

303
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:15,597
Those who were unable to follow traditional wisdom, those who did not obey the wisdom passed down to them.

304
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:21,592
They lived in suffering, not living right.

305
00:53:21,917 --> 00:53:32,017
You know, they were in need of things, were in need of everything.

306
00:53:32,582 --> 00:53:37,082
They wouldn’t live long either.

307
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:43,497
They wouldn’t live long, those who followed their minds like that.

308
00:53:43,977 --> 00:53:52,097
They wouldn’t live long. You see, that’s how true what the people back then talked about is.

309
00:53:52,492 --> 00:53:55,132
They wouldn’t live long.

310
00:53:55,407 --> 00:54:01,037
They would also pass away easily with minor sicknesses.

311
00:54:25,097 --> 00:54:31,397
They said that I would do what [instructions] I heard.

312
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:44,692
If I live according to my loneliness, I will not be doing it to myself, but will cause suffering to those who have departed from me

313
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:49,012
If I live according to my suffering like this.

314
00:54:49,582 --> 00:55:02,052
Since I would cause suffering to them, I should support myself to those who are good, who are mentally healthy, support myself with those who are healthy.

315
00:55:02,252 --> 00:55:08,432
They say that I am like this now, though I have reached this age still standing.

316
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:17,357
Indeed, he said that he showed what a person is like.

317
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:21,147
"You are truly showing what a person is like."

318
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:32,962
They said that some people who live according to their loneliness too much

319
00:55:33,182 --> 00:55:41,472
They say that a person who lives according to his loneliness too much goes through [life] quickly.

320
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:47,722
A child spoke truly about what a person is like.

321
00:55:48,457 --> 00:55:55,932
He was a child to me since it hasn’t been long since he was a boy.

322
00:55:55,932 --> 00:56:08,082
I looked at him and said, "You see me now. You may seem insignificant because you were born so late.

323
00:56:08,662 --> 00:56:21,422
"You make me remember that traditional wisdom must not be misunderstood when you say this.

324
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:23,842
"You’re a good person.

325
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:31,712
"Also, never [?regret] the fact that you are standing alone, dear cousin."

326
00:56:31,712 --> 00:56:42,312
I say to her, "To not [?regret] it. When we’re near the end, when we reach it, we will go after them."

327
00:57:07,067 --> 00:57:17,297
Only those who doubt the traditional wisdom passed down to them are like that, being in need of things.

328
00:57:17,837 --> 00:57:27,837
Things are scarce for them, and they have nothing. They are always without things.

329
00:57:28,222 --> 00:57:37,982
Also, this mischievous behavior now, it’s like it steals what some people need.

330
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:43,447
It’s like they trade what they need to use for mischief.

331
00:57:43,842 --> 00:57:51,172
They trade what they need to use, giving them to their mischevious behavior.

332
00:57:51,452 --> 00:58:02,162
Poor things, they are now misbehaving with what they call alcohol, and this marijuana.

333
00:58:02,452 --> 00:58:09,582
It truly seems that what they want to abuse is waging war against them.

334
00:58:10,132 --> 00:58:16,052
It’s like they give their own spirits through that.

335
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:22,687
They pass by what they should do and forget it.

336
00:58:25,932 --> 00:58:36,222
Now, people have become alcoholics, coupling it with what they call marijuana.

337
00:58:36,292 --> 00:58:46,332
Those who continuously abuse mentally impairing things also take their own lives through that.

338
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:55,347
It’s like they take their own lives. It is very heartbreaking to part with the younger generation.

339
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:24,157
Also, I would apparently put myself down too much.

340
00:59:24,157 --> 00:59:31,007
That’s why I don’t want young people do to that now, telling them not to think themselves incapable.

341
00:59:31,057 --> 00:59:37,687
Instead, I tell them to treat themselves well, and to believe they are capable.

342
00:59:37,747 --> 00:59:44,677
Also, when I was a girl like this, I would associate with my fellow girls.

343
00:59:45,087 --> 00:59:49,847
It was because I thought I wouldn’t be as pretty among them.

344
00:59:49,872 --> 00:59:52,252
Those are my memories.

345
00:59:52,567 --> 00:59:57,682
I also didn’t join those who were mischievous.

346
00:59:57,682 --> 01:00:02,512
I also didn’t join those who played outside in the dark.

347
01:00:02,522 --> 01:00:10,382
But when we were in the wilderness, I would only slide and gather wood.

348
01:00:10,617 --> 01:00:15,987
I would also hunt.

349
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:24,877
That why, young people, do not dislike yourselves, but treat yourselves well.

350
01:00:24,947 --> 01:00:37,797
Also, if you remember them, even if you don’t do them, you may do bad things if you don’t go to them or take them.
