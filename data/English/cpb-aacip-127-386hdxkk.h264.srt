1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:08,630
Please start talking about how people, you, moved here to Atmautluak again.

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,520
And when, what year, did you move here?

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:23,160
Yes, these ones first moved here to Atmautluak in 1969.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:33,880
Then in one year in ’71, I moved here.

5
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:48,342
A person, it’s because a person, we Yupiit, historically only to places where there is fish since a long time ago.

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,940
It’s because we’ve always eaten fish starting from our ancestors.

7
00:00:54,175 --> 00:01:00,005
So they moved to get food from here.

8
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:01,065
Yes.

9
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:12,155
Yes, had we not moved, the people of Nunpitchuk across there would have nowhere to be now.

10
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,640
We live on the coast.

11
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:28,115
And on the coast, those who go to the wilderness have traditional instructions

12
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:32,735
Or when they go to the ocean, they have traditional instructions in the ocean.

13
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:46,899
How, here as you grew up here deep in the wilderness, how did your elders instruct you when you started traveling?

14
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:53,894
How did they instruct you so you wouldn’t get hurt, or so nothing would happen to you?

15
00:01:53,902 --> 00:02:05,042
We had traditinional instruction back when we were young, especially [to take] a shovel or ice pick, a walking staff.

16
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:11,587
They also talked about that staff, saying it is life for a person.

17
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:19,402
These are also the important things they instructed:

18
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:33,627
Those seal gut rain parkas, we Yupiit, back before these Western things came, they used to use those seal gut rain parkas.

19
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:39,637
Then for us who were born after Caucasians had come

20
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:52,282
Our parents used to instruct us to especially keep those rainproof clothes with us even if the weather seems good.

21
00:02:54,357 --> 00:03:01,827
Because sometimes, the weather doesn’t relent like this in the spring or fall

22
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:12,037
Those were the things that they especially told us to have with us.

23
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:21,157
Because if we don’t have a staff, we won’t know things, and we won’t know that something is dangerous.

24
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:32,982
Or, they also told us that when we travel in the winter, to always have a shovel in our cargo even if the weather is good.

25
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:44,087
If we get into misfortune, it turns out, in the wilderness, or if a blizzard his us, or the weather changes on us, they also instructed

26
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:50,542
They told us not to stop at a small snowbank.

27
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:58,392
But also, if we have no tarpaulin, if we have a shovel

28
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:04,782
A snowbank, dig into an already formed snowbank.

29
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:16,272
They told us to stay inside of it, but to also get a piece of wood to poke [the ceiling].

30
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:21,532
When it gets hot, poke it to ventilate it.

31
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:32,552
Those were our important traditional instruction from our elders.

32
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:48,344
Also, since I am thankful for it, I want to give one quick traditional instruction to our youth.

33
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:58,038
Also, when I got married, when I got married

34
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:08,290
Or when I also had children, since my father wouldn’t hold back when advising me back then

35
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:15,778
He used to speak to me like this: a child, should we have children

36
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:27,821
Even if [s]he comes in crying that we shouldn’t as questions, or ask what’s wrong or who did it.

37
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:31,507
He said not to be defensive over them.

38
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:40,741
Watch, he said, if we defend them, that little child will be able to make us believe [anything].

39
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:47,019
As we go, [s]he can make us upset with our friends.

40
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:54,922
Then when it’s time for him, since they’ve also started going to school

41
00:05:55,903 --> 00:06:00,994
He said that even if people admonish them, [s]he will not obey.

42
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:05,495
He said it’s because [s]he has us to defend them.

43
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:17,329
Since I especially yearned to say that because I'm thankful that you came, I spoke about it.

44
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:27,836
Now, those who drown, there are now a lot who drown in the summer.

45
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:38,748
What about in the past... they say there’s a lot, and I hear that it’s like we’re dying in great numbesr in our day through the river.

46
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:52,503
What can you instruct those who travel, boys or others, so that they wouldn’t do that?

47
00:06:52,721 --> 00:07:03,948
Yes, especially what they said about this, they weren’t actually completely without it.

48
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,542
Back when we were born, because we were born when there’d been Caucasians

49
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:15,172
But having gotten these fast boat motors

50
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:27,464
Those especially, starting to use these vehicles especially is what’s causing people to die in great numbers.

51
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:36,243
And abusing this mind-altering substance is probably what’s making do that.

52
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:44,803
Long ago, and in my time, all of the stores down in Bethel were all liquor stores.

53
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:56,268
But since they didn’t have sophisticated vehicles back then, though they [drank] like that, they didn’t know [of people dying a lot].

54
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:07,126
Now, we do instruct our children, and I also advise my children

55
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:13,121
But these days like that, and me, like my parents

56
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:18,980
I used to watch my late father and myself

57
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:25,580
But I cannot [instruct] them exactly like he did.

58
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:36,555
I did that because they may feel offended or may go in the wrong direction. It turned out I made a mistake.

59
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:48,462
Yes, if I love them, I must not hold back speaking about everything dangerous like this

60
00:08:48,468 --> 00:08:52,159
So that they will remember them.

61
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:55,279
Now, [unspecified] know[s] many times...

62
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:04,961
Those who [?break apart] their parents evidently do not live well.

63
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:13,995
Also, those who don’t follow the traditional wisdom passed down to them like this, are like those who’ve ended up on the ground.

64
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:19,800
Also, though [s]he tried not to be heard of in other villages

65
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:28,204
That person is like something waving on top of a pole when [s]he doesn’t follow their traditional wisdom.

66
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:38,007
However, one who follows their traditional wisdom seems absent, and they seem absent even here in neighboring villages.

67
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:47,148
Lastly, how would you, Fred Pavilla

68
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:56,633
Something important that you want to leave the next generations

69
00:09:56,645 --> 00:10:07,999
What would you [pass on] to us, should we, by happenstance, live after you, who do live, who will live

70
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:13,035
How can you instruct us? What can you leave with us?

71
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:17,432
I can leave with you young people

72
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:25,515
Like this, no matter what a person is like, even if they’re bad, socialize with them

73
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:33,905
Or if you have none, offer a small conversation like that, or if you have some, feed them.

74
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:43,826
It’s because no matter what a person is like, what they seem like, all of us people are faulty here on this earth.

75
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:57,364
They said that a person who is [nice] like that is never without help should they get into misfortune.

76
00:10:57,671 --> 00:10:59,816
A [nice] person like that.

77
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:08,971
Also, how [s]he would be seen, how [s]he would be talked about

78
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:13,005
They say people are excited to see them.

79
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:18,092
Like that, or people are excited to help them.

80
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:26,738
One who lives socializing like that, one who lives treating everyone they see with love.

81
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:35,870
That was my most important traditional instruction from my parents.

82
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:46,843
No matter what one is like, or an orphan, or even if [s]he’s not an orphan, they told me to help a person in misfortune all the same.

83
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:49,696
I see.

84
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:51,485
Thank you.

85
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:52,767
Yes.

86
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:01,743
Girls had traditional wisdom specific to them.

87
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:13,570
What traditional instructions from back what you were very young do you most remember now?

88
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:21,873
The traditional instruction I was given, there are many for women.

89
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:26,606
Boys also [had] separate ones, it seemed they were separate.

90
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:32,390
Even if they weren’t separate, they had traditional wisdom specific to them.

91
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:39,418
And the traditional wisdom passed down to me have been revelead these days.

92
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:47,226
Lo and behold, they were revealed these days.

93
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:54,670
In my earliest memories, we were baptized, they’d been baptized.

94
00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:02,990
I became aware, and later here, when our baptist came to us, we were baptized.

95
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:07,565
To me, it’s been quite a while since I was born.

96
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,930
Then, we were given traditional wisdom

97
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:25,694
Even if our fathers and mothers don’t harshly speak to us, even if they don’t shout at us like this

98
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:37,134
It was like they were scary even if they weren’t scary, even if they didn’t harshly react to us, raising their hands against us.

99
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:50,616
We women had traditional wisdom saying not to wander in the evening, and not to have many visitors.

100
00:13:51,128 --> 00:14:02,345
This was important from my mother, my mother and father, like this:

101
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:08,721
They said that I shouldn’t listen to people speaking of something bad.

102
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:20,508
Then if I see someone giving instruction, if I see someone giving instruction

103
00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:30,482
They said to go to and listen to one speaking of admonishments.

104
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:33,801
They were peaceful back then.

105
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:40,253
But these things the Bible spoke about

106
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:48,650
As we’re coming to what was foretold, you must live carefully.

107
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:52,674
Try to be careful.

108
00:14:52,798 --> 00:15:02,748
So when this comes [to pass], you will not be surprised but recognize it, and even if you dislike it, you will not think it amiss.

109
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:18,059
And this man or woman who tends to speak harshly, speak loudly, they don’t like that.

110
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:32,531
And harshly speaking to a young boy in his presence like this, with people listening, without regard for how he might suddenly react

111
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:40,232
They say that causes them to be a certain way [makes them hardened].

112
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:55,140
These days, our traditional wisdom, I’m starting to remember it since I’m starting to struggle with my grandchildren or my children.

113
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:58,305
Since I’m starting to struggle, I’m remembering it.

114
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:12,986
They do not think that person who shouts, speaks loudly, is good

115
00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:18,146
Or those who react [badly] to those who instruct them.

116
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:31,135
This is what I tell you young people to make you steadfast

117
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:41,724
Also, do not merely look at something bad, and one who doesn’t merely need to be told like this like us.

118
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:48,937
Us too, some of use were also disobedient.

119
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:58,813
From our mother, just the two of us, she would tell me that.

120
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,278
Also, you may know these days.

121
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:15,716
These days, you only here it inside these churches.

122
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:28,622
But, having no one to instruct you in random places like that has probably done that to you.

123
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:37,853
One who doesn’t need to merely be told and scatters is like an orphan.

124
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:41,481
And eventually, [s]he comes to misfortune.

125
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:48,108
We, your elders, are sometimes weak.

126
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:59,129
Though these young people are admonished, look, they drop their admonishments.

127
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:03,764
This is as much as I remember.

128
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:17,887
So, when you were going to get married, how were you instructed about how to be a spouse?

129
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:23,413
I was finally instructed when I was going to get married.

130
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:32,015
And before I was 13, I lost my arm like this to a misfire.

131
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:43,301
Then I wasn’t expecting to get married. It turned out my mother took care of me.

132
00:18:43,318 --> 00:18:47,688
I didn’t think I’d be with a person without an arm like this.

133
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:54,619
But she finally instructed me when I was going to get married.

134
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:58,805
She covered everything.

135
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:03,144
She talked about everything.

136
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:11,772
And the admonishments against harshly replying to my spouse like this

137
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:17,536
The admonishments

138
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:22,616
She finally told me of the admonishments.

139
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:34,419
It was daunting. It was daunting to do something like that in their presence, or even if wasn’t in their presence.

140
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:39,977
And they’d let them imaging their mother and father were watching them.

141
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:49,877
That was what my admonishment was like when I was going to get married.

142
00:19:50,742 --> 00:20:02,533
And I shouldn’t go to various places. And when I first saw a child, now there was a lot of traditional wisdom.

143
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:15,762
These days, however, those who get married or have children, it seems that they do whatever they want.

144
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:20,844
They do whatever they want.

145
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:31,020
Then a man gets married later. Then they also instruct him like that.

146
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:37,027
They told me not to treat my spouse harshly.

147
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:45,838
And do not use my mouth against him, and don’t reply harshly when he treats me harshly.

148
00:20:46,065 --> 00:20:56,985
Then when that last man gets married, they’d also instruct him.

149
00:20:58,163 --> 00:21:02,793
They’d tell him to make sure his spouse is in peace.

150
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:07,341
And to say that he will stop after being upset.

151
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:09,228
Please wait a short minute.

152
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:10,178
Okay.

153
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,760
That down there is going to be replaced.
