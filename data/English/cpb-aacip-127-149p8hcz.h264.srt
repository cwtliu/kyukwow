1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,890
Now, it hasn’t been a long time since our old lives, but...

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,830
Okay, since I was asked to speak, I’m going to speak.

3
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:33,350
What we did when we first got married

4
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:39,615
And I was asked to speak about the traditional wisdom passed down to us.

5
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:52,821
And now, it hasn’t been too terribly long since our old lives.

6
00:00:53,269 --> 00:01:04,198
But I was completely prepared on how to be married when I started.

7
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:14,030
But my late grandmother, and my mom and father would tell me

8
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:17,916
That I should be careful with my spouse.

9
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:29,494
Also, they said that even though they speak badly about him not to tell him.

10
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:39,693
Also, I have another with me, a male younger sibling.

11
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:51,410
They also used to tell not that no matter what people say about his wife, not to believe them if he didn’t see it with his own eyes.

12
00:01:51,417 --> 00:02:09,133
That’s what my father used to tell me to. He told me not to suspect my spouse if I hadn’t done anything, and not to accuse him of being with other women.

13
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:15,453
He said, you know, that brings discord.

14
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:24,033
I was also told not to tease my husband too excessively.

15
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:35,277
Then he would also tell me this: even if I have nothing and I am short on things, never to say this: "I am without."

16
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:42,839
He said, watch, I will affect my husband’s mental health.

17
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:45,656
This is what I was told.

18
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:54,947
We were also admonished against being suspicious of each other.

19
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:59,131
They said that only those who are guilty are suspicious of their spouses.

20
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:08,334
Then young people, girls and boys who are young now

21
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:20,444
There is also traditional wisdom saying that we should be careful with our mouths toward our peers.

22
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:24,821
They also told us not to live life saying harsh things just because we have mouths.

23
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:35,788
They say that wicked people and those who say harsh things come to times when they are ashamed.

24
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:45,398
They say that they see things differently as they are told to.

25
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:57,819
Then, they also said that even if we are accused, to stay quietly if we hadn’t done it.

26
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:01,306
That is also an admonishment.

27
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:13,202
Then we were also admonished against going to people too much.

28
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:23,692
Watch, they said, we would come across things that affect our mental health, or hear bad things.

29
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:31,756
This is what we were told.

30
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:44,883
They also told us not to invite our relatives to eat by treating them, well, you know

31
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:52,412
No matter what they do to them, do not be quick to say things, because that also leads to discord.

32
00:04:53,073 --> 00:05:02,373
Then, my late grandmother and father would also tell me

33
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:22,197
They said that if I am too mischievous, people will speak about me, and people in other villages will know what I’m like.

34
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:27,039
Now, all people give that piece of wisdom.

35
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,160
Also, well

36
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:47,557
We need to admonish those who are mischievous and try to start a commotion.

37
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:57,875
Also, it truly is something admonished against.

38
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:07,748
My father also used to tell me this: that I shouldn’t try to come up in other villages.

39
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:17,500
Then, if I travel to where it not my home village, I shouldn’t [?misbehave].

40
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:26,423
Also, if I were in another village, they told me not to be the source of commotion.

41
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:31,838
He also told me to live as a stepping stool for those around me.

42
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:49,057
The traditional wisdom, they also used to tell me this: even if I don’t experience them, if I remember them, it’ll be like I experieced them.

43
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:14,120
Also, these days, there are now very many things that cause people to misbehave.

44
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:24,862
Then now, even when I wander around villages

45
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:36,345
What my father and late grandmother said sometimes come up on my mind.

46
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:51,959
That’s why even though I travel to other villages, what’s right in front of me, if a person focuses on what’s in front of him and doesn’t mess around, it would be good.

47
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:03,017
Anything else?

48
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:07,610
What else? Wait.

49
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,682
Okay.

50
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:27,650
Just now, you know, I just said that saying speaking harshly to one’s spouse makes things go wrong.

51
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:34,901
Then they would also tell me this:

52
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:46,943
They said not to tell a spouse, a husband, things that would negatively affect his mental health.

53
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:57,717
Then I was also told when I had children, that I should instruct that child.

54
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,585
They said children don’t forget.

55
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:16,873
Then they would admonish me against asking him things, or asking him what his peers are like to him.

56
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:26,965
I was also told not to verbally defend them. You know how some are verbally defensive.

57
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:34,184
Then they said not to verbally defend him, but to admonish him.

58
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:45,250
They said that if I verbally defend him, I will encourage him to lie and slander.

59
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:57,572
Then they also admonished me against excessively raised a hand against them.

60
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:00,984
They said I would make him stubborn.

61
00:10:01,512 --> 00:10:11,196
They say they make them stubborn when they raise their hands against them too much or shout at them. They say they make them insolent.

62
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:16,409
They say that’s how they make them insolent.

63
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:27,757
It turns out, we must not be verbally defensive over these children.

64
00:10:30,342 --> 00:10:38,759
They say that those they defend and those who slander other to their parents cause commotion.

65
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:43,445
I was also told that.

66
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:47,725
I was also told by my mother

67
00:10:50,382 --> 00:11:03,232
No matter what they do to me, and when I sometimes got tired, she would admonish me against talking about those.

68
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:08,371
She said people would start a commotion starting from me.

69
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:22,555
Then no matter what anyone did to me, she admonished me against going home crying.

70
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:34,815
And even though I was doing those things, when my children would come in crying when they were small

71
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:44,365
My father would also tell me that, saying that I needed to be told.

72
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:50,667
Then I would try not to leave, but stay thinking I had done it.

73
00:11:50,697 --> 00:12:02,822
Then children like this in their future, when they’re admonished

74
00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:10,394
And they do not run away, but stop when told to stop.

75
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:15,182
And don’t say this to them: "I will get him."

76
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:22,227
The children who are told that learn to go home crying

77
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,890
Including the ones they verbally defend.

78
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:39,401
That’s why it’s an admonished, because that makes them liars and slanderers.

79
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:56,174
Then my late grandmother would also tell me when we were inland back then, that I should eat when my husband is gone, but to wait for him.

80
00:12:56,186 --> 00:13:07,019
Then, because I liked to be with only old women, and older adults

81
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:12,667
When my late grandmother told me that, I’d ask her why, "Why?"

82
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:30,481
Then she said to me that should there be a food shortage, I would pretend there’s not enough for my family and eat alone, and my family will starve, and I will let my husband starve.

83
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:49,753
Okay, ready?

84
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:58,859
Okay, since I was a bad person at that time

85
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:09,336
I would ask questions like this and ask them why.

86
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:19,035
I would as Aana and mom why, but I couldn’t [ask why] with my father like that.

87
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:32,786
But all of them used to tell me that if I am too wicked of a person, and if I [stop taking care of] children after receiving money

88
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:38,459
My husband will decide to leave me because of my character.

89
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:51,046
Then, they said that when a man is too disobedient

90
00:14:51,057 --> 00:15:05,623
They also leave those who stop taking care of children after receiving money, and who do not heed advice.

91
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:19,240
Then [the family] breaks up. They can’t take husbands anymore. Then the man cannot take wives because people found out [what he’s like].

92
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:23,166
They said that some who do not heed advice

93
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:30,689
They said that some...

94
00:15:31,637 --> 00:15:40,404
Well, I also knew what my father would say to my younger sibling.

95
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:44,748
Then they said that some men

96
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:59,238
They said that some men, though they can change their ways, are disobedient for a long time.

97
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:05,923
And they say that some change their ways when they’re old men.

98
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:15,079
They said that women, however, many do not change their ways.

99
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:21,475
However, they say that men change their ways more easily, so they change their ways.

100
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:26,338
They said that women, however, do not change their ways.

101
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:32,661
That’s why they said we women should try to live sensibly.

102
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:50,601
As we just heard at first, though we do not do them, if we remember them, we will end up not doing them.

103
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:56,761
Now, they said, that we should live quietly.

104
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:32,991
Then when I became a woman, I would also be told

105
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:48,686
Now, they said, I’m not a child anymore; I’ve become a woman. But, they said, that I should always wash my hands before taking anything.

106
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:59,312
Then they said that I should not step over men’s clothes the same way, clothes and food.

107
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,048
They told me not to step over them, including food.

108
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:11,574
They said we scatter impurities on them.

109
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:22,131
Then they told me not to leave my hair untied. They said we pour, we scatter impurities on things.

110
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:38,266
Then, since we were all by ourselves, since the two of us grew up alone

111
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:50,690
Then they would tell us not to play with each other, saying that I’ve become a woman.

112
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:54,866
They said they’re careful around men when they become women.

113
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:59,476
They’re also careful with their breath and saliva.

114
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:09,345
Since we were together and with each other at the same age, my father would speak to us like that.

115
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,941
Then they said

116
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:27,724
They said that if I pass a man who id downwind from me, I should hold my breath and let him pass.

117
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:30,728
They said he might inhale my breath.

118
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:39,182
Then, my companion also, my younger sibling

119
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:49,167
They also told him that if he passes a woman that he should pass upwind from her, and if a woman goes upwind from him, that he should hold his breath as she passes.

120
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:58,715
They said that he might inhale her breath.

121
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:04,267
Then what would happen if they inhaled it like that?

122
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:12,917
Apparently, people had very strong restrictions a long time ago.

123
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:23,488
And women, men and women wouldn’t interact with each other.

124
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:33,982
They said that those who submit to men too much drive them sex crazy.

125
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:42,133
They also say that those who are sex crazy die, their groins rotting.

126
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:48,585
They say some die when they stop eating, and some suddenly get overwight.

127
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:53,236
These are the things they talked about that are dangerous to people.

128
00:20:53,256 --> 00:21:01,106
That’s why people a long time ago didn’t get sick, because they weren’t unclean.

129
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:10,224
And the men and women only had single bowls [for each]. They were the same, and they didn’t exchange their bowls.

130
00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:19,845
And the women wouldn’t have disheveled hair.

131
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:31,023
Just now, my father and paternal uncle kept a very close eye on my hair. I couldn’t ever go without braids.

132
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,272
They said it was because I might scatter impurities that would cause sickness.

133
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:41,855
That’s what they’d tell me.

134
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:53,082
Then they said that some women who think too much about men have imaginary husbands.

135
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:58,756
They also stop eating, and always imagine having lovers.
