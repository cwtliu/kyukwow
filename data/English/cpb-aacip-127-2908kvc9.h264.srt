1
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,320
You know, some of these children don’t like doing things, and some do.

2
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:19,285
Oh my goodness.

3
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,170
I should be on [?].

4
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:25,405
Yes. (Good.) Yes.

5
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:27,505
Will you ask me questions?

6
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:30,830
Yes.

7
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:39,755
I can also speak some English even though I didn’t go to school for long since I used to stay with Caucasians.

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,540
Where with Caucasians?

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,510
With Cakayak and family, John Samuelson.

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,620
I’ll talk about it.

11
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:50,605
The Caucasians in Nunapitchuk. (Did you grow up with them?)

12
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:54,220
No, part[ly], only sometimes.

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,490
Where? Was the Samuelson family at Nunapitchuk?

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,270
Yes, they lived there.

15
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:05,545
They moved from Nunacuar to Nunapitchuk. There, Cakayak traded.

16
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:09,885
After he bought that?

17
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,080
He was a prolific trader.

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,630
And he had very many of what they called his merchants.

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,150
He had a trading post there in Nunapitchuk.

20
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:26,975
[That was] when Nunacuarmiut exiled him. Villages used to exile people.

21
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:29,615
And he went to Nunapitchuk.

22
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:38,085
You know, they exiled people. They probably still exile now, kicking them out as they say in English.

23
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:43,425
That’s what happened to Cakayak from Nunacuar to Nunapitchuk.

24
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:49,885
It’s probably different now. It was like that back then.

25
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:51,475
Why did they exile him?

26
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:56,125
They exiled him because he would fool around and had many children.

27
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,720
Speak briefly on that.

28
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,080
I won’t talk about it.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,730
Cakayak was good.

30
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,220
Indeed, he bore many children, he sired many children.

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,340
That’s why they exiled him.

32
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:18,515
Villages don’t exile good people.

33
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:24,085
Only when they do something wrong.

34
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:37,555
Now, please speak about things you remember back when you were a little girl as you remember it.

35
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:48,390
I just said that I was born over on Nelson Island, but I don’t know [exactly] where I was born.

36
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:55,820
Then because they travel like this, you know, move, nunalinqiggluteng

37
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,740
My parents apparently came here to the Kuskokwim.

38
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:03,780
I’m not sure why they did.

39
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:15,940
Then in Oscarville, Kuiggayagaq, our older brother was Cakayak’s late father’s, Oscar Samuelson, helper.

40
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:23,060
And our mother would work on fish there with Oscar Samuelson, Cakayak’s late father.

41
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:30,820
Then we were there all summer. And when fall set, we went up to Kasigluk in the Akula region.

42
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:39,625
We were there. You see, I wonder how many years we stayed there in Kasigluk?

43
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:50,935
Because people were apparently fickle, for our eduction, my parents... those poor people were apparently fickle.

44
00:03:50,935 --> 00:04:01,225
We moved to Nunapitchuk, it turned out because they were going to get a teacher. They didn’t get a school right away.

45
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:08,630
Back then, what did your parents think of going to school?

46
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:14,620
Did they support their children having a Western education?

47
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,260
Please talk about what you heard about that.

48
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:21,075
I don’t know what I heard.

49
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:31,465
Because my parents probably supported our education, they moved us from Nunapitchuk to Kasigluk.

50
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:37,175
There was also a village in Nanvarnarrlak over from Nunapitchuk.

51
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:43,310
Then the school... no, when a school was built, they moved to Nunapitchuk.

52
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:53,000
Just when we moved there, the teachers were in houses. There was no school.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,150
And we’d have school in the old church inland. It was upriver, upriver from us.

54
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:07,970
But I wonder how many years? It seems that we went to school in the church for two years or one year.

55
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:20,495
Then when that old school inland was built, the ones in Number Two from Nanvarnarrlak inland moved to Nunapitchuk.

56
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,090
It was a big village, Number One, Number Two, and they had those names.

57
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:32,085
Probably because they were supportive, those villages also moved to Nunapitchuk.

58
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:34,525
Like that.

59
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:43,755
Now, these elders, and probably your peers, say this:

60
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:53,016
When they went to school back then, their teachers would tell them not to speak English, I mean no, in Yup’ik.

61
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,762
They were very strict. What did you do?

62
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:58,019
Like that.

63
00:05:58,217 --> 00:06:08,317
And they’d punish one who spoke [Yup’ik] by sending them to the corner, and they’d face the corner for several minutes.

64
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:10,413
That’s what they did to us.

65
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:14,426
Then they also wouldn’t let us eat, no lunch.

66
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:16,493
Would they eat?

67
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:21,091
That’s how they would chastise us.

68
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:24,969
And it seems I also heard, but I never saw.

69
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:30,998
They said they would be spank them with those things. You know, spank.

70
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:33,728
I don’t know about them.

71
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:49,275
Now, it seems that we are more focused on school than when you went to school.

72
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,177
Now? Yes.

73
00:06:52,563 --> 00:07:00,374
They go to school for a long time probably because they focus on it.

74
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:05,198
Our first teacher then was also Yup'ik.

75
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:09,846
You know, [?Anrok], Sam [?Anrok]. That one.

76
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:14,988
[S]he was accompanied with their daughter, Ruth Hall. She became Ruth Hall over there.

77
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:23,402
They were the first to become teachers in Nunapitchuk. The very first ones, parent and daughter.

78
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,560
Apparently, they came from Unalakleet.

79
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,757
Like that.

80
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:35,817
That’s how they would chastise them.

81
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:39,460
And they wouldn’t chew tobacco in  school.

82
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:47,866
Before we started just now, you said you were going to say something you never heard of.

83
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:51,321
Yes, we haven’t gotten to that yet.

84
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:55,768
So now, (Okay.) please talk about it. (Okay.)

85
00:07:56,753 --> 00:08:01,875
I... are you recording me now? Okay.

86
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:03,682
Okay.

87
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:12,947
Because people are too wealthy tehse days, you know, since we’re now wealthy, I want to say something.

88
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:16,016
We were poor.

89
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:19,164
I was also poor with my parents...

90
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:27,405
And yet we were happy, we’d eat, just happy.

91
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:29,840
Yet we were [poor] like that.

92
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:33,384
There was nothing in our houses.

93
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:40,436
Only two small boxes down there... and, you see, I didn’t see any shelves.

94
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:42,727
There’d be two small boxes down there.

95
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:52,730
You see, my mother would open them when they were going to have hot drinks and take out cups, then we’d have hot drinks on top of them.

96
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:58,029
And it seemed we wouldn’t was dishes. I don’t know.

97
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:02,378
Since I’d always visit others, you see, I didn’t take care of them too much.

98
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:11,719
Then these days, people are excessive.

99
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,495
In Yup’ik... will you translate what I say into English?

100
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:27,674
You see, I especially want the youth to hear this, but because they always speak English and don’t speak Yup’ik, they won’t understand a lot.

101
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,978
It’s probably fine if I periodically do some of it in English.

102
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:38,775
These days, our houses are very excessive.

103
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:41,403
We’re rich right now.

104
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,670
We have everything in the house.

105
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:51,830
We have everything. It seems we’re Westers, yet we’re Yup’ik.

106
00:09:52,735 --> 00:10:07,791
Then I mostly stayed there with Cakayak and family as a girl, where Johnny Samuelson had a trading post in Nunapitchuk.

107
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:15,443
You see, his wife wouldn’t do much, you know, seeming to always be careful.

108
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:24,505
You see, I would always was dishes. And I didn’t have my first menstruations [at] maybe 10 years old, or nine, at that time.

109
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:31,826
And I’d always wipe [dust] off of things because his wife would tell me to.

110
00:10:32,325 --> 00:10:35,425
Apparently, because they were Caucasian.

111
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:40,841
Well, half breed, since her husband was half. I’m not sure what his wife was.

112
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,638
I grew up like that.

113
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:50,342
And when I went home, since I didn’t always stay with my family, when I went home

114
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:55,260
I would do the same in our house as I did at the Caucasians’.

115
00:10:55,268 --> 00:11:01,457
I would fix these things. Apparently, I’d also dust things out.

116
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:05,194
You see, I’d do them well.

117
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,210
I learned from them.

118
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:17,196
These days, there is high school, [and] college.

119
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:28,146
I think, "These people absolutely know things, including how to clean up inside the house."

120
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:38,287
That’s what I think. Being like that, I learned it from being among Caucasians.

121
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:51,730
Then these days, that old lady there in Nunapitchuk apparently wasn’t a very old lady at the time.

122
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:53,651
I would visit her.

123
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,804
You see, I’d go in and that woman would be steadily washing her dishes.

124
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:04,130
And she’d steadily wipe her kettles like this on top of her stove.

125
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:12,714
Then when I went in, since that woman had burnt sugar cantly, you know how people make burnt sugar candy.

126
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:16,605
It seemed to me that there was no candy back then.

127
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:21,832
That woman would give me burnt sugar candy, and I’d put it in my mouth.

128
00:12:22,037 --> 00:12:25,915
It tasted sweet and delicious.

129
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:29,398
That was the reason I’d want to go to that woman.

130
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:43,249
Sometimes, that would would say to me, "Cuzz," because I was her cousin, "Cuzz, if you became able like me and get married, do what I do.

131
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,594
"Watch, you will have things.

132
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:59,267
"If you don’t wash things in your house," I was a little girl, "if you leave them, watch, dust will cover them.

133
00:12:59,282 --> 00:13:04,716
"When it eventually gets bad, you don’t keep it anymore and throw it away."

134
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:10,629
And that may be new, but dust and dirt covers it.

135
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:14,610
Then it becomes undesirable and you wouldn’t want it anymore.

136
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:17,002
You see, that’s what she’d tell me.

137
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:25,860
She also told me this: she grew up somewhere, children’s  home, Moravian home.

138
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,443
It was probably among Caucasians.

139
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:33,892
She said she learned how to clean up the house from there.

140
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:41,809
Oh my, these days these teenagers, they’re smart.

141
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:49,287
They know how to clean up the house. They know how to do everything.

142
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:54,556
But they just sit and watch TV all day, maybe.

143
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:59,730
Lazy, never do anything.

144
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:04,341
There you have it.

145
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:09,511
That woman who became and old woman’s instruction...

146
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:12,672
Oh no. Oh my goodness.

147
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:14,075
It’s okay.

148
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:15,745
Ready?

149
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:21,794
She’d say this to me: "Cuzz, watch, someday you’ll get a husband."

150
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:25,271
Uingelleq, have [a] husband.

151
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:28,147
"Watch, you will do that.

152
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:34,889
"Then when you do that, if you don’t wash your things, you won’t have anything.

153
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:42,629
"And watch, your husband may be a very good hunter, watch, you will be destitute."

154
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:45,195
That’s what she’d tell me.

155
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:56,670
It turned out, you see, that things need to be taken care of in the house, you know, need to be taken care of.

156
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:07,139
These days, I thought I’d become knowledge about that back when I would stay with Cakayak and family.

157
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:16,678
I had gone to school, but it seems, I mean, since I didn’t go to school for long, I didn’t learn much.

158
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:21,966
Then these days, they also say this:

159
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:30,811
"A woman with female children, watch, that woman will watch her mother in the house.

160
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:39,038
"Then her work and what she does, that woman’s child can copy her."

161
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:42,874
These [words] are true.

162
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:48,961
And now, I have nine children, five girls, four boys.

163
00:15:49,118 --> 00:15:58,140
And these five girls are all different. You know, they’re different.

164
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:05,045
And I love them all very much.

165
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,902
Then when I started making things and started sewing

166
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:16,449
And my daughters grew up and started making their own living.

167
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:21,078
I’d keep making them  things and sewing them things.

168
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:30,324
I’d sometimes go in their houses, and what I sewed would be on the floor. You see, I’d be upset.

169
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:36,280
It turned out that what was supposed to be kept well was on the floor.

170
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:40,149
I’d go in one of daughters [and the house is] neat.

171
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:45,874
Oh my, what I made would be treated with love.

172
00:16:46,347 --> 00:17:00,436
Then when I did that, among the five girls of my children, two of them, I won’t say their names, are neat from what I’ve seen.

173
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:04,072
Neat, as they say in English.

174
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:09,802
They’re good. All of them are good.

175
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:18,943
Then I realized this: those two would take great care of the clothes I sewed.

176
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:27,764
Since the other especially cares for them, when I go into her house because we see them

177
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:41,995
In the summer, the things I made by sewing, parkas, fur boots, furs, fur clothes, I never see then in her house during the summer, nothing.

178
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,890
She put[s] them away.

179
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:48,414
You know, she puts them away.

180
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:57,783
I know that in the West, fur [clothes] have places, suitable spaces.

181
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:02,478
It’s not hot, it’s not cold, maybe meduim.

182
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,998
Then their fur is good.

183
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:16,001
Look, when these skin clothes hang for years and years, they’re no longer suitable to wear [?from wearing out].

184
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:21,152
And if I take this parka, it rips. [?It wears out].

185
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:27,331
Then now, I’m speaking about what I don’t hear in these TV’s.

186
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,729
Many would speak of those long ago.

187
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:43,360
It’s important these days because people are too wealthy, since things are God’s gifts.

188
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:47,346
Things in the house are God’s gifts.

189
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:53,499
A woman must take good care of them.

190
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:58,261
You see, some men do [that].

191
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:01,587
Now, I have different sons-in-law.

192
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:06,475
Some of their husbands likes to help their wives.

193
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:10,873
Some of my children are like that.

194
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:15,375
Some of their husbands is sedentary.

195
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:19,543
His wife is hot and works around him.

196
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:23,907
And her husband doesn’t help her because he’s a man.

197
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:32,383
It’s because men are supposed to work out there, outside work, and woman in the house, inside work.

198
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:39,278
But because people are different, my daughters have different kinds of spouses.

199
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:47,578
Some of their wives, you see, I really like those spouses who take care of their spouses.

200
00:19:47,593 --> 00:19:49,681
My goodness, that person’s so good.

201
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:52,215
We tell them [that].

202
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,882
They are lovable.

203
00:19:55,109 --> 00:20:01,009
Those who are sedentary like this, how should I say it?

204
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:04,924
These days, they say, "Weird."

205
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,473
I don’t understand this word "weird."

206
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:12,292
It seems that one who’s sedentary like that is weird.

207
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:22,425
You see, when I speak, I add in some silly things.

208
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:28,183
I especially wanted to talk about this.

209
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:43,159
How teenagers these days don’t really do anything, I [am] sorry for them.

210
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:52,521
And their mothers would keep working, while her daughter here lays down and reads.

211
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,616
It’s probably because they’re fluent [enough to read] books.

212
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:04,546
And some what they call video [games], ding ding ding ding ding.

213
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:17,080
[S]he sits down for a couople hours when they should work, standing up and helping their mother or father.

214
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:22,210
I’m speaking of these things.

215
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:37,193
And because they’re with God, we must take good care of God’s gifts in the house.

216
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:53,744
That’s what I especially wanted to, you know, talk about because there’s way too much work to be done in a house these days.

217
00:21:54,135 --> 00:22:00,813
It’s unfortunate because we’d eat, and when we’re done, you see, the table would have a mountain of dishes.

218
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:06,092
Or in the shelves over there, so many dishes to wash.

219
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:11,700
Then this mother keeps working.
