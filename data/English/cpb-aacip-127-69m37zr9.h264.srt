1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,230
Please try again.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,710
Let me try speaking. Can you hear me?

3
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,540
Now, let me speak of the traditional wisdom when I was growing up.

4
00:00:40,552 --> 00:00:53,741
I grew up where we had a settlement in the wilderness inland, or we had our own settlement at the mouth of Tagyaraq.

5
00:00:54,171 --> 00:01:06,104
But in the summer, we were be at the fish camps when I was a girl. We would stay in the wilderness inland in the fall with no one around us.

6
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:11,285
And downriver in Tagyaraq during the winter, there was no one around us.

7
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,934
But when we went to fish camps, we’d finally start seeing people.

8
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:26,554
Then I would stay with my grandmother because she raised me, because my grandparents raised me.

9
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:35,198
However, I had two other women with me. We were a family.

10
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:47,747
Then my grandmother would tell us, and she would admonish us in the morning when we wake up against fighting, that we shouldn’t fight.

11
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:57,655
We small family, we small family in that house did not fight.

12
00:01:57,655 --> 00:02:04,888
She would tell us this: we should always be busy and help each other without fighting.

13
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:14,832
Then when we went to populated places, she would also say this to me when I was going to go out in the morning:

14
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:26,570
If they pick on me, and if they pick on me as we’re playing, that I should run away. She told me not to retaliate.

15
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:40,106
Then she would also tell me this: no matter what a person does to me, I should not retaliate, but always treat my peers with love. She told us to treat each other with love.

16
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:43,682
She also said to treat all of our peers with love.

17
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:53,417
Back when I was a girl, when we were girls, she would talk to us about how we should behave all day.

18
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:59,101
That’s why we feared her since she spoke to us as if scolding us.

19
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:07,846
When we disobeyed her traditional wisdom, my grandmother would speak to us very sternly as if scolding us.

20
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:14,968
That’s why we were afraid to go against her traditional wisdom.

21
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:23,990
The would instruct us to treat each other with love like that, and not to pick on our peers.

22
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:31,062
And no matter what a person does to us, we should not retaliate.

23
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:40,567
But they would say this to us: we shoudl always be busy, and not visit each other too often.

24
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:52,441
She said that if we visit other people too often, we’ll eventually be offended. She said that if we visit too often, we’ll eventually be offended.

25
00:03:52,638 --> 00:04:05,994
Then she said that if we visit too often, we will lack things. She said that when we will lack things when we should have worked.

26
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:13,207
Then she talked about grass since we were all women

27
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:22,860
Back when I was growing up, people always took grass and wove them.

28
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,905
They made fish containers in the summer.

29
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:35,372
And they would pair king salmon with tall cottongrass, then cover them with tall cottongrass.

30
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:43,242
They said that if we do not gather, it will be clear what we would do. We would ask for things from our neighbors over there.

31
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:49,290
If we do not gather tall cottongrass to pair them with, we will ask for things.

32
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:56,879
She said that if we do not save things, we will be beggars. That’s what she told us.

33
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:01,820
We were poor. There was nothing when we were growing up.

34
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:09,726
Then she would tell us, well, it wasn’t like how it is now when we were growing up.

35
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,198
I haven’t become a very old lady yet.

36
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:22,850
But because I grew up around those old people, it seems they lived a very old life.

37
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:30,678
That’s what she told us, that we’ll be beggars if we do not save things.

38
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:45,788
And she said that if we’re going to sew, see how it’s not scarce these days, if we’re going to sew and we don’t save things, we’ll ask for thread from our neighbors over there.

39
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:57,187
Or, she said that we might borrow or ask for a needle if we don’t store things. That’s how poor we were.

40
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:01,890
That’s why our traditional wisdom warranted respect.

41
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:16,180
Then after telling us that, she would tell us that if we see a fish, this fish is the first thing.

42
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:27,616
If we see a fish, we should welcome it without thinking it’s too little. We should hang and dry it.

43
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:32,892
She said that would become food if we hand and dry it.

44
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:40,488
In the summer like this, she said we should cut even a single fish and hang it.

45
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,477
Then she said that when it dries, we can make it into dried and boiled fish.

46
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:51,761
However, she said that if we ignore it saying it’s too little, worms will eat it.

47
00:06:51,802 --> 00:07:03,013
Worms destroy it, flies lay eggs on it and worms infest it until it’s no longer edible.

48
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:12,778
That’s why se said to store even a little fish. She said it becomes food even though it’s not a lot.

49
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:16,260
That’s what she would tell us.

50
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:24,435
Then, should we have providers, since we’re all women

51
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:30,414
Though there’s a lot of food [to prepare], a woman should not be overwhelmed by it.

52
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:40,536
Instead, she said she should not do a sloppy job on it. She said she should do it well and dry it.

53
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:47,158
Also, she said not to dump fish guts to where people have trod, but somewhere that no one has trod.

54
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,220
She said that fish guts are an eyesore when scattered on the ground here.

55
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:58,093
She said that being without food and an empty stomach is unbearable.

56
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:01,019
This is the traditional wisdom passed down to us.

57
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:09,548
They said that it’s worse having an empty stomach than any ailment or sickness.

58
00:08:10,178 --> 00:08:14,378
That’s why a fish, these are our traditional wisdom.

59
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:20,642
That’s why they said not to despise a fish, to keep it even if it’s bad.

60
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:24,360
They said we won’t dislike anything if our stomach is empty.

61
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:28,654
These are the traditional wisdom passed down to us when we were young.

62
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:36,483
They also told us not to scatter food waste, but to throw it away where people have not trod.

63
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:42,127
And if we work on fish, they told us to throw away the waste where no on has trod.

64
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:48,017
They said that a fish that a person [?] should not be [?].

65
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:51,707
They also told us not to dislike our food.

66
00:08:52,592 --> 00:09:01,547
They said that if there’s no food, we will not dislike or reject anything, since a person truly will not reject anything if he’s hungry.

67
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:04,729
These are our traditional wisdom.

68
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:16,834
Then, they said that should we marry and take care of a child

69
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:28,802
They said we should not push him to our husband. They said that that man travels.

70
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:35,850
That’s why they said we shouldn’t push that child to that man.

71
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:44,904
They said that if we are in a bind, he must play with him to entertain him, since a couple should help each other.

72
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:50,908
But they said he’s a traveler. We shouldn’t let him take care of the child.

73
00:09:51,109 --> 00:10:00,920
They said that he would be sad over his leaving. When his father leaves, he would be bad missing him.

74
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:14,129
Eventually, they said that in his travels, he would be worried over him back home, and have bad travels if the child misses him.

75
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:24,244
They would admonish us against pushing our child to the man like that if we have children.

76
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:38,419
THen they said that when we raise our child, we will stay with our child in the house since we’re the caretakers, unlike the men who travel.

77
00:10:38,747 --> 00:10:45,399
They said that we must watch our children in the house.

78
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:51,968
They also said not to react excessively when they misbehave.

79
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:58,769
They said that they get worse when they react excessively when getting tired of their misbehavior.

80
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:09,047
They also said that if we scold them, that we don’t need to add to our voices. We shouldn’t raise a hand on our children.

81
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,484
They said if we raise our hands on them, he’ll be impertinent.

82
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:20,798
They also said that if we excessively shout at him, he’ll be impertinent. They said that we’ll make our child impertinent.

83
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:26,197
That’s included in the traditional wisdom for women.

84
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:33,922
They said that we’ll make our child impertinent if we excessively shout at him.

85
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:39,515
He’ll be bad and disobedient though we admonish him.

86
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:47,974
Also, if he’s mischievous and we react excessively, he will get worse.

87
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:54,307
That’s why they said it’s okay to encourage a child instead.

88
00:11:54,391 --> 00:12:07,791
Then they said that if we scold, every person can be irritating. They said they don’t always treat their children with love. They scold them when they get tiring.

89
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:11,093
They said that if we scold, we will scold him.

90
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:15,720
They said that after scolding him, do not laugh at him but leave him alone.

91
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:20,493
Leave him alone and don’t say anything [else] if we scold him.

92
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:26,852
Only when he gets better, treat him well after scolding him.

93
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:33,760
And if he cries, do not laugh at him after scolding him.

94
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:42,795
They said that if we laugh at him, he will become bad. They say that children who are laughed at also become bad.

95
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:54,820
That is also included in what we should do when we raise children in the house.

96
00:12:55,534 --> 00:13:02,556
It’s because raising a child is not easy.

97
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:11,484
It’s hard work. We worked hard to raise our children back then.

98
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:17,307
And it wasn’t like how it is now when we raised our children.

99
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:22,352
We didn’t have disposable diapers.

100
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,731
That’s why we had a lot of traditional wisdom.

101
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:36,250
They said that if we sleep to much, we’ll get urine on us. Our child will urinate on his bed and get it on us. It will smell like urine.

102
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:38,787
Now, you like to be very clean.

103
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:46,489
They said that if we sleep too much, our house will smell like our child’s urine

104
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:50,028
Because we don’t have them urinate at night.

105
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:56,494
We would wake from our sleep, and have our children urinate in urine buckets at night.

106
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:01,329
And when we got up, we’d take the urine container, go out, and dump it.

107
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,924
They had diapers we’d need to wash.

108
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:16,824
We would always wash them since they didn’t have a lot of diapers and would run out. We who didn’t have a lot would wash their diapers later in the day.

109
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:27,183
That’s why we have that traditional wisdom, to look after little things.

110
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:36,328
They said that a person who doesn’t care for things doesn’t have anything.

111
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:39,278
He throws things away thinking their insignificant.

112
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,298
They also said that storing something does not [?].

113
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:52,378
They said that the time to use it comes when they put and keep it, then the time to use it comes.

114
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:59,310
That is our traditional wisdom, at the traditional wisdom I grew up with.

115
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:05,078
Then this love is an important piece of traditional wisdom.

116
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:11,472
No matter what our peer does to us, never retaliate.

117
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:19,020
Then if a guest arrives, socialize with him even if you don’t know where he’s from.

118
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,456
I was very shy.

119
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:28,775
I would be very daunted when they said this to me: "Even if you see him for the first time, socialize with him.

120
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:40,064
"And even if you see a guest for the first time, if there’s none for him, welcome him by mouth, talking to him, or feed him if there’s enough for him."

121
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:42,824
Here, I was very shy.

122
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:53,265
They said that socializing with a person by mouth or be feeding him, a person makes close friends.

123
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,869
He becomes friends with those he socialized with.

124
00:15:57,882 --> 00:16:04,793
They say that some people are daunted when arriving in a village, and it’s true.

125
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:16,718
Those things that they talked to us about are true, that it’s difficult for a person to arrive where he’s never gone before.

126
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:24,922
That’s why we must give a hearty welcome to someone we don’t know or haven’t seen anywhere before.

127
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:34,808
They said that he’s daunted because he doesn’t know where he’s going. He’s daunted by that village because he doesn’t know where he’s going.

128
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:42,168
That’s what it’s like. When we go somewhere we’ve never been before, we’re daunted.

129
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:47,306
That’s why you young people should remember this.

130
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:56,528
Also, no matter what your peers do to you, never do anything because they did something to you.

131
00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:03,905
We were also told to respect our parents.

132
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:09,528
That’s why to you who still have parents, this is the traditional wisdom passed down to me.

133
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:18,434
We must defer to and respect our parents, and try to adhere to their traditional wisdom.

134
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:21,911
That’s what we were told.

135
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:25,975
THat’s why we had to respect those who raised us.

136
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:32,482
THis is the traditional wisdom passed down to me when I was growing up.

137
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:42,382
There is a lot of our traditional wisdom, Yup’ik wisdom. There’s traditional wisdom for everything.

138
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:49,978
If we talked about them, we’d talk for a long time. There’s traditional wisdom for everything.

139
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:58,901
These are the important traditional wisdom passed down to me, looking after fish.

140
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:09,023
And to treat our peers with love no matter what they do to us, and not to retaliate no matter what someone does to us.

141
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:17,393
And how to take care of a child if we raise him.

142
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:20,993
What else?

143
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,304
Leaving us a legacy?

144
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:40,334
I would leave you, my grandchildren, with something that will never end if you remember it, I would leave you with traditional wisdom.

145
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:48,179
I just said now, "You must treat those around you with love."

146
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:58,329
No matter what anyone does to you, treat them with love. And do not do anything if they do something to you, but love them all the same.

147
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:03,509
This love is to be your bequest.

148
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:11,039
Then, love those around you, and depend on your God.

149
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:15,574
That is what I bequeath to you, my grandchildren.

150
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:30,187
Then my grandchildren down there, your relatives, I tell them at the dawn of every day to teach them, so that they will inherit the traditional wisdom.

151
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:36,500
So that you will remember it though I leave this place and you no longer see me.

152
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:52,587
I tell them at the dawn of every day to treat their peers and what siblings thye have with love, of even if they’re not siblings, or not to retaliate no matter what their peers do to them.

153
00:19:52,762 --> 00:20:02,712
I also tell them not to speak harshly, you know, not to speak without thinking.

154
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:08,981
If you speak without thinking, you will come to regretful times.

155
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:14,156
That is my bequest that you must remember.

156
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:23,306
Though I leave this place, you must remember it, as an inheritance.

157
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,969
You know, about being lazy.

158
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:47,976
If a person is lazy, they also tell us this:

159
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:59,551
"There is no one without a lazy inclination. Every person is lazy [sometimes].

160
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:08,770
"But if a person lives by ’breaking’ his laziness and does things in spite of his laziness will be called one who is not lazy.

161
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:15,133
"However, a person who follows his laziness and is sedentary is lazy."

162
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:26,890
Truly, someone who does things in spite of laziness, who does things without laziness, eventually becomes eager.

163
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:42,090
Eventually, he remembers his chores, and knows what he needs to do, knows how he needs to serve, and knows them despite not being told because he does them.

164
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:47,984
He knows what he does, and knows how to do things.

165
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:52,778
That’s what a person who’s not lazy is like.

166
00:21:53,084 --> 00:22:03,959
He knows them because he does them despite his laziness. Then even when he’s lazy, he raises his hand, is no longer lazy, and is eventually eager.

167
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:12,728
He starts wanting to do things, wanting to do things, doing chores. That’s what someone’ who’s not lazy is like.

168
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,290
He starts thinking of his chores, knowing his chores.

169
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:27,947
Yet since a lazy person follows his laziness and is sedentary, though he knows what he needs to do, he’s lazy.

170
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:35,253
They say that one who follows is laziness like that is called a qessanquq.

171
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:42,472
Yet one who is not lazy, they also tell us this: "There is no person completely without laziness.

172
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:52,316
But one who lives by ’breaking’ his laziness and does things in spite of his laziness is called one who is not lazy."

173
00:22:52,335 --> 00:23:02,073
That’s true, that if he does things in spite of his laziness, he’ll know his chores, know what he needs to do.

174
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:06,198
He knows the chores he needs to do for others.

175
00:23:06,204 --> 00:23:13,142
You also like to clean things. He’ll no longer be lazy to clean, but become eager.

176
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:18,867
Now, you clean everything.

177
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:23,943
He’ll become like that, eager to do his chores.

178
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:30,780
Yet if he’s sedentary out of laziness, he puts up with being sedentary following his laziness.

179
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:38,049
They say that one who obeys his laziness will start to be called a qessanquq.

180
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:47,724
Then, this is the wisdom I pass down especially to your relatives down there, my grandchildren down there:

181
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:57,093
"There’s no person completely without anger. Every person, even if he’s not great, gets angry."

182
00:23:57,131 --> 00:24:06,256
I’m not great, not a good or great person, yet I am easily angered, my inclination to become angry right here.

183
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:10,200
Indeed, my inclination to get angry is right here.

184
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:18,556
That’s why a person shouldn’t be proud of being angry. Every person, even if they’re not great, experiences it.

185
00:24:19,182 --> 00:24:24,007
He also shouldn’t be easily angered because he’s angered easily.

186
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:29,451
Someday at the end of our life, we will not experience anger.

187
00:24:30,776 --> 00:24:40,188
I end it with this to them down there: "We will not progress to salvation through anger."

188
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:52,276
This is what I bequeath. You shall inherit it. I pass on this wisdom to you down there, "We will not prgress to life through anger."

189
00:24:54,864 --> 00:25:11,151
When the lord is going to throw us into that bad place, we will not go there saying this: "I won’t go there because I’m angry." We won’t say that.

190
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:20,939
Because I am easily angered, I remember that we will not experience my anger there at the end of our life.

191
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:25,526
So, let us who are easily angered remember it.

192
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:33,420
This is what you must remember. Even if you’re easily angered, think like that.

193
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:42,020
Also, what it’s like for you to be lazy, to obey laziness.

194
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:49,670
Yet doing things in spite of laziness makes you keep doing it in spite of laziness.

195
00:25:49,789 --> 00:26:00,439
Also, after being very daunted, even after being daunted by [preparing] a lot of food, they are finished with continued work.

196
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:09,233
Also, try not to keep whatever articles of clothing in a mess, because when they’re worked on even if they’re a lot, they’re eventually finished.

197
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:17,821
Then before they’re infested with worms, they’re finished when worked on in spite of laziness, before they "bump into laziness" as they call it.

198
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:23,340
That’s what being lazy is like.

199
00:26:23,778 --> 00:26:30,140
They also say that laziness makes one have nothing, and makes them lack things.

200
00:26:30,728 --> 00:26:35,041
That’s what being lazy is like.

201
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:43,103
So if you ask me anything else, I will answer if I can, but will not answer if I can’t.

202
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,678
Yes.
