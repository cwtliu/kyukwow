1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,051
Ah, I will not date him if he has one eye.  

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:22,220
I mean it turns out we thought the same thing to the ones he talked to.  

3
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:31,463
These cousins of mine had thought the same as I did.  

4
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:39,567
That's all how we were, poorly. 

5
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:50,729
We believed what were told by speakers without doubting much of it.

6
00:00:53,632 --> 00:01:07,162
There are those who are hard to talk to.  How did they know by observation their journey ahead?

7
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:20,054
The ones who were hard to talk to were talked to but when they didn't use their advice they would say this about them.

8
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:24,054
Ah, be just the the way you are.

9
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:31,930
When you reach in your mind something you like and take apart your advice.

10
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:32,950


11
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:45,512
You heard it, you didn't follow but wish you had.

12
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:52,162
What, what is an example you can expound on it further.  

13
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:56,312
What did you see, you see

14
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,940
hearing the advice of the speakers then

15
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:05,003
what is that with an example?

16
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:10,340
Do you mean of one who is hard to talk to?

17
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,971
Yes, the one who is hard to talk to as they mentioned of him.  

18
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:17,268
You saw with your own eyes, one who did that.

19
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:22,268
What was it that he wanted to undo?

20
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:33,317
The ones who were hard to talk to didn't listen and that's what I saw.

21
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:48,500
I knew they were unhealthy, wanting to be able to do what other's can and will get done for their own stomach and body. 

22
00:02:48,887 --> 00:03:01,700
That's how they were with their advice they didn't heed.  Those who didn't listen on their own of given advice.  

23
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:18,166
They lived sickly, not successful, well like they didn't have everything and lacked it all.   

24
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:29,533
And, so they didn't live long.  They didn't live long those who followed their own mind and action. 

25
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:46,833
They didn't live long.  See,truly it's very correct what they use to tell us.  They didn't live long.  They didn't live long.  They would be sickly and suddenly they're gone. 

26
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:59,766
Now, now today today so you've arrived at today.  In this day and age now,

27
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:15,399
with your observation of the distant past on longevity.  On those who hard to talk to, are they any different living today?

28
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:28,750
Today?  Yes, in our day, for us today are they dying faster or how is it?

29
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:39,800
(Living) It is faster on the ones hard to talk to, faster than the ones who follow their advice.

30
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:56,100
They are faster. Their living is faster.  Faster on aging for women and of men aging faster.  You see (it).

31
00:04:57,846 --> 00:05:06,567
That's how it is on this.  Like that...going at different pace. 

32
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:23,066
However, those who heed and follow their advice go through it slowly or so it seems.  Slowly or it is that way.  

33
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:39,033
You see it.  Anyway, awhile back that poor father of yours prays... he comes to pray for me when he arrives in Kongignak all the time. 

34
00:05:39,951 --> 00:06:01,300
When he came in to pray for me he said to me gratefully, "My poor cousin, I'm grateful you're looking good and shows your mind is well. Thankful you look good." 

35
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:22,966
I tell him, "I use what I heard to be as I am.  If I live with my loneliness I will not do anything for myself.  I'll only hurt the ones who I leaned on for deep support.  

36
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:37,466
If I lived in pain, I would put them in pain also.  Now I bring myself up to where the ones who have cared for themselves mentally.

37
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:46,466
I find self care on top of it.  I am how I am even though I'm where I am standing.                            

38
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:59,533
He said, "Yes, exactly. You have presented what it's like for someone to be at.  Truly you have presented a persons life.

39
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:11,333
There could be someone who is lonely, gives into that

40
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:26,466
who gives up for loneliness goes through a fast journey."  His comment is exactly describing it.  He's still a child, that one.  

41
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:36,799
To me he's still a youngster, that's to me.  He was just a lad, recently.  I said to him, "Look at that.

42
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:46,566
As you see me right now.  You were born later finally no more or less.

43
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:59,999
You make me recall this short saying which stays with someone who didn't misunderstand it as you say that.

44
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:11,499
Very well.  And you know you're the only one living now, in no case don't regret your loss about that, my poor cousin."  I say to him.  

45
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:25,699
"Don't regret your loss that might have been prevented by appropriate action."  Poor, he say's 'yes' and nothing else.  

46
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:55,458
If there's one to pass on to us who are behind you, can you tell us what you especially would pass on.  

47
00:08:56,288 --> 00:09:08,083
What I have already said, I do consider that will be like true passing on.  

48
00:09:08,658 --> 00:09:29,749
Ones who don't listen lust like the ones before will be like the ones who didn't listen.  He will be like someone who doesn't listen who won't have what he needs.  

49
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:46,374
But, then there's one who is easy to talk to who will have blessing ahead of him.  It's available in his journey as he comes across it on his many travels.  

50
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:55,916
That's how he will be if he does not doubt.  

51
00:09:56,716 --> 00:10:17,541
But those doubtful of their advice have not much of what they want,   They do experience more need and it stands out.  

52
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:27,416
And on using (recreational drugs) nowadays it takes away from some people what they would have provided. 

53
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:40,791
Seems like they trade what they need to using, trading alot of useful items to fool around with it.  

54
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:59,499
Poor thing! On using of recreational drugs/mistreatment using alcohol and smoking drugs consequently its like a warfare of self because of using them.   

55
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:12,124
It's like they give up their life with that.  It wasn't their time to be unaware of themselves. 

56
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:36,124
It's become a habit with that, this alcohol coupled with smoking drugs.  It's a foolish habit.  Their lives are cut off from that, too. 

57
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:48,999
It's just like cutting it.  Its something one does not wish to part with for us left behind. Big but have to part with.  

58
00:11:49,944 --> 00:12:05,874
Now at this time using to us has become a lifestyle by all of the village inhabitants. 

59
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:15,124
All of the countries population...attempt to use this so called alcoholic beverage.  

60
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:21,958
Before them, we drank home brew. 

61
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:39,333
It was our alcoholic beverage.  My husband returned from white people and he arrived with a big bag full of potatoes. 

62
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:53,833
And he also came with two big bags of sugar and one of them was to be used in the potatoes. 

63
00:12:55,146 --> 00:13:06,958
And me, there ready for his coming cooked and mashed those potatoes and after mashing when I filled the barrel...

64
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:18,666
just like that I learned the process. I filled that barrel thinking of the drinks in containers.

65
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:27,124
I covered it with a seal intentine, tightening it with a cord.

66
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:37,416
It had a cord.  After awhile that cover of the barrel starts to inflate.

67
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:46,374
It is inflated for two days and its third day it comes down a little. 

68
00:13:47,300 --> 00:14:01,749
So it goes down and once down we opened those potatoes had sunk to the bottom.  The top of it was very clear.  

69
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:16,208
Oh, we ladled it onto containers.  We filled tea kettles.  We filled big kettles and pots.  Filled them with covers.   

70
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:25,708
The rest of it we added and mixed with a cup of sugar.  It spread quickly.  

71
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:40,708
And, so we used those and used them as it became what it was but they didn't get like these today.  

72
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:52,833
Their love didn't change.  They didn't hate.  But liked one another, like that.  

73
00:14:55,208 --> 00:15:10,708
So, we quit brew...one time I...we always cut fish down river on the tundra.  One time I said to that Acill'aq.  

74
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:21,708
"I am not going to go to my invites with drinkers.  I'm about to quit.  It's plenty that I used alcoholic drinks."

75
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:35,458
He said to me.  "If you quit, I will quit, too."  We quit then in by telling one another. 

76
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:46,541
We had invitations but ignored them out there"  They were about to have it, people of Canineq.  So there

77
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:57,958
I quit from that point on.  I quit long ago.  I was still very strong living at that time.

78
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:11,791
So, I quit a long long time ago.  We both were done with it at the same time. 

79
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:25,458
Oh me, my dear cousin in case you have a lady partner it's a great idea to agree and be together. 

80
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,041
To be in agreement as partners, it's a great thing.

81
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:47,791
You see, my poor self is thankful having no regrets towards my previous partner.  Only gratefulness.  

82
00:16:48,372 --> 00:17:00,958
I think of how fortunate after he went ahead of me how fortunate I didn't go against his order.

83
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:08,999
Thank goodness I was his partner hardly going against his order or command while I could see him.  

84
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:19,666
I am thankful that we didn't go against each others will, so thankful.  

85
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:30,208
He was also, at that time, he was about to leave his body.  I had no idea as I watched him.  

86
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:40,291
He said to me, "Fix my pillow over there.  I'm getting sleepy so I am going to sleep."

87
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:49,291
Just yesterday in the evening, up above he'd say, 'Jesus'. 

88
00:17:50,160 --> 00:18:00,791
To me that person up there is moving at such a a good speed.  He's is going above at a certain speed looking to area below.  He would look sideways turning his head. 

89
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:13,333
That person  It was evening at that time and he says, "Jesus is coming in. "

90
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:31,124
"He came in."  When he came in, he talked to Jesus happily.  Shortly he said, "He just left."

91
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:50,041
On that moring he stopped breathing.  He layed down.  After he laid down, I sat at the end of him.  I put a blanket on him when he wanted to lay down.  He said he was sleepy and will sleep.  

92
00:18:50,758 --> 00:19:07,333
He perched his neck up and said to me, "Poor you, I became your partner back in time because I wanted to but, I'm sleepy now and will go to sleep.  

93
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:21,291
He never said what he was going to do.  I'd think, oh my I thought he slept all night.  I sleep attending to him.  

94
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:38,083
I noticed his breathing was getting quiet.  He would breath in and would let it out.  His throat had no saliva whatsoever.  

95
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:43,958
It seemed he was going to sleep and fell asleep.  

96
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:52,708
As he made me watch him, his face was about to return to look as he was young.  

97
00:19:53,458 --> 00:20:07,999
The look on his face was very good.  As if he's not an old man anymore. His face was very good.  He layed there like a young person. 

98
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:25,333
Also, your poor cousin he took to fix his body.  I believe they made him stay three nights in that downriver house.  

99
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:31,958
On the third day it was getting close to evening, he was brought to the church.

100
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:45,541
The next day we went up and I saw, my, your cousin had returned to his youth when he had no children.  

101
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:56,833
He looked even better than how he looked at the house.  So youthful...who wouldn't think otherwise, how young he looked. 

102
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:11,874
It was shared that he looked like when he didn't have any children.  His good look had returned to when he had no children.  It was very good to view him.  

103
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:17,374
Oh that situation, we didn't know what was happening next. 

104
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:28,124
He had his children sing church songs because it happened on a Sunday as it came to closing of oneself.  

105
00:21:29,214 --> 00:21:35,958
Your other poor cousin was holding his feet below him.

106
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:42,749
And, his other children were closed in on him and singing.  

107
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:55,291
So, as they ended one song and stopped, he said to them, "Sing that song, Aleluia."

108
00:21:56,074 --> 00:22:03,916
So, they know the song all those children of his.  They sang it.  

109
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:16,166
One of them held his neck with his arm, that poor Ap'ac.  She's here to have her baby.  Apac is one of his children.  

110
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:23,416
She embraced him around his neck and pulled him up for me to see his face, smiling.
