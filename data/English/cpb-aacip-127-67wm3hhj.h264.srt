1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,730
What? (It looked bright.)

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,620
You haven’t started it yet? (Yes, wait.)

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:25,595
Okay, when you start it, ask me about how they prepare what they need to use in the fall.

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:31,910
Will you be sitting like that?

5
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, I’ll be sitting like this. (Okay.)

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,880
So, how did they prepare in the winter like this?

7
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:56,490
You mean how people back then would start preparing in the fall?

8
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,490
Yes.

9
00:00:58,565 --> 00:01:01,520
Our ancestors?

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,490
Yes.

11
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:14,700
So, I am not very old right now.

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,470
But now, I am 68 years old.

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,930
I’m from Tuntutuliak.

14
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,700
And they would call me Ackiar in Yup’ik.

15
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,850
Then after Westernization, they’ve started calling me Nick Lupie.

16
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:51,505
And so, you just asked how they started preparing in the fall

17
00:01:51,505 --> 00:02:01,805
Or how they started preparing what they’d need to use in the winter.

18
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:12,630
Now, I’m going to speak, yes, about what I know and what I’ve seen.

19
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:21,895
In the fall upriver in Kialiq when we were boys

20
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:28,995
Upriver at the mouth of Kialiq, they called that stream Qukaqlircaraq.

21
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:33,575
We used to stay there.

22
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:44,835
Our caretakers, however, were not sedentary in the fall like this.

23
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:53,745
Or, they also didn’t travel without physical labor.

24
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:06,440
These things they used for the fall, when they came from the fish camps across there like this

25
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,480
They would gather wood in the fall.

26
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:18,625
And they didn’t have boats, only kayaks.

27
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:26,485
Because there is a very high tide in the morning during the fall like this

28
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:33,715
They would start traveling early in the morning in the dark.

29
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:46,045
Sometimes, however, a kayak would appear coming through Cingik downriver towing wood.

30
00:03:48,234 --> 00:04:02,142
In the fall like this, when they were going to travel here to the headwaters of the rivers to go to winter camps

31
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:06,956
They would gather those.

32
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:19,033
Our elders, those who raised us, were not like how we are now.

33
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:30,954
They would travel, rowing with their own arms, rowing through the water.

34
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:42,475
Then when it was time for them, they started going upriver.

35
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:48,263
They brought those pieces of wood with them.

36
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,918
Then they would put their possessions as cargo on top of them.

37
00:04:57,248 --> 00:05:02,448
Those without boats would move with wood.

38
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:13,788
Then when they arrived at the headwaters of the rivers where they would camp for the winter, they would bring the wood inland.

39
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:28,819
Then they would prepare that wood, preparing their fish traps to catch fish with.

40
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:40,395
Those who raised us back then lived hard lives.

41
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:47,991
They would make that wood into fish traps, large fish traps.

42
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:59,746
The openings of those large fish traps were like this, wide and long.

43
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:09,889
And they were like this, the inner components they called ilulirpiit.

44
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:18,511
Then they would make the middle of the fish traps by expanding them.

45
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:24,377
Then they would place the third over there.

46
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:32,261
They referred to those real fish traps as qamut.

47
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:40,180
These big fish traps were not like, you know, traps for blackfish.

48
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:46,780
And they had gaps of this size, made them with gaps of this size.

49
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:53,119
Yes, they didn’t make those large fish traps without a process.

50
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:57,948
They used these as measurements.

51
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:04,533
And then they would put the split spruce there.

52
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:14,952
Then after doing this, they would make those large fish traps with about this size gaps to the side.

53
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:28,604
When they started working on them like this, their hands would get raw from doing this.

54
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:40,956
They wouldn’t use twine, but they split wood like this until they were thin in diameter, thin.

55
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:46,944
They would make them about this wide, but thin.

56
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:51,566
They wouldn’t work on those without a process either.

57
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:56,888
They had measurements of how thick to make them.

58
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:07,319
When they started doing that, these got raw from doing this.

59
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:20,395
When they started bleeding, they would cover these three with skin

60
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:24,216
When these got raw.

61
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:31,576
These too, these would get raw from holding it.

62
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:40,031
Our ancestors back then were not like how we are now.

63
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:46,747
They had wooden possessions.

64
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:52,923
They used wood to make their possessions.

65
00:08:52,935 --> 00:09:05,924
They used it for their tools, their things, their houses, what they had in their houses, and sleds.

66
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:13,932
They used this wood for survival.

67
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:32,700
However, when they started setting them, they would check on them every day like this.

68
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:41,874
And they would wake up in the morning when the tide had gone out after coming in

69
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:58,808
They would get up at night, go down to the stakes of the fishing tools, and stick them further in after chiseling the ice like this.

70
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:10,700
This is how our caretakers were back then, not like now.

71
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:26,191
Then when fall came like that, they would also prepare things for their women to use.

72
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:42,202
They made what they called waterproof fish skin boots out of fish skin, including king salmon.

73
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,409
They referred to fish skins as amiriit.

74
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,366
Hold on for a moment.

75
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:05,866
Please start again.

76
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,642
It’s time to start? Okay.

77
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:24,899
Just now, I talked about men’s work, how men worked to prepare their things.

78
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:37,374
However, women would work separately before it froze to prepare things for their men.

79
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:51,687
Clothes they would need, skin boots, and these fish skins, king salmon

80
00:11:52,544 --> 00:12:00,656
They called it "removing fish" when they made fish skin boots for them.

81
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:12,119
Also, with those, they wouldn’t just stop at removing their flesh

82
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:22,457
When they finished removing their flesh, they wouldn’t work on them right away.

83
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:38,595
They would also soak the fish skins in urine like this to remove the fishy smell.

84
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:46,020
They say  that when they aged urine

85
00:12:47,701 --> 00:13:02,639
Into some containers, the men would urinate into the designated containers to age urine, as they called it.

86
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:06,389
Those would smell very strong.

87
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:14,389
They would soak the fish skins in those.

88
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:25,346
Then after soaking them, they would scrape them, scrape them after putting them on boards.

89
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:32,096
Then they would hang them outside to dry.

90
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:45,409
And then when they dried, they would make them into skin boots for their men.

91
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:50,690
They called it making them fish skin boots to travel with like this.

92
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:56,434
Their men would also prepare.

93
00:13:57,915 --> 00:14:06,465
When they stopped using those traps for black fish, what they called large fish traps

94
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:16,834
When they were going to change them from the blackfish [traps]

95
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:25,665
They would also then make those fish traps.

96
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:36,241
Then when they started setting them

97
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:50,541
These days, we temporarily store blackfish in various things, old boxes and burlap bags.

98
00:14:51,016 --> 00:15:00,179
However, the ones I observed that raised us didn’t have those.

99
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:13,566
Their women would also prepare containers for them out of grass.

100
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:24,029
When they’re no longer green like this but become pale, they would gather a lot like this.

101
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:34,648
And in the summer like this, I forgot something.

102
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:47,630
Their women would prepare those that they would use, the coarse grass that they would use for stitches and other things.

103
00:15:49,842 --> 00:16:01,855
Those who raised us back then always had the future in mind like this.

104
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:11,480
They would always prepare what they needed in the future even if it was far because they didn’t have anything.

105
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:18,892
What they had was only made from what was on the land.

106
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:25,811
To them, they couldn’t afford not to do that.

107
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:35,367
They would prepare what they would need way ahead of time.

108
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:44,186
In the summer, they would use tall cottongrass for stitching.

109
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:55,836
When the women started gathering tall cottongrass, they would spread them out to dry them, as they called it.

110
00:16:56,005 --> 00:17:09,817
Then when they had, as they called it, dried out, they wouldn’t gather them but weave them.

111
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,043
Then when they were done, they rolled them up.

112
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:19,906
That’s what they did with the grass they’d use for stitching.

113
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:35,125
When I remember those during our time, I also find it difficult to do it.

114
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:42,363
And then their men

115
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:58,007
They would make these tools, fish trap-like traps to catch minks.

116
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:09,514
They would make fish traps small, about this long, and a certain size after measuring the streams.

117
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:16,758
Those were also not made without a process, but had measurements.

118
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:23,515
Their inner components would not be like this like a blackfish trap.

119
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:31,028
They would be like this, and this over there would be like a den.

120
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:43,778
When I watched my older sister’s husband like this back then

121
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:56,141
He would do this with his hands, and measure the entrance, what they call the igyaraq.

122
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,135
That’s what they were like, not made without a process.

123
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:13,016
Then when he made fish trap-like traps for land otters, he would make the entrances like that.

124
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:23,041
Then he would measure with his hand like this, doing this with his thumb to measure their width.

125
00:19:23,585 --> 00:19:32,485
Those would also not be made without a process.

126
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:47,129
These days, when I remember how they used to live back then

127
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:57,405
You know, when I remember them, I would feel like they had difficult lives.

128
00:19:57,517 --> 00:20:12,380
But since I [grew up] when after Westernization, our caretakers lived with some Western things.

129
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:19,592
But they didn’t get a lot of [Western] things.

130
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:33,342
They had these things, tea, floud, sugar, and once in a while, pilot bread.

131
00:20:34,342 --> 00:20:48,992
However, when they brought in whatever they got, they would smell very strong.

132
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:53,499
These days, those don’t smell like anything.

133
00:20:53,512 --> 00:21:04,412
When they took out pilot bread, they would smell strong from afar, they smelled nice and good.

134
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:11,994
These days, I don’t notice them anymore.

135
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,475
But once in a while, I smell them when they’re close.

136
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:23,831
That’s what those were like.

137
00:21:24,894 --> 00:21:33,156
What about the admonishments they had for men, you know, when they traveled in the fall like this?

138
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:39,194
So, yes, when they traveled like this

139
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:49,625
They would admonish them when it was dangerous like this.

140
00:21:49,938 --> 00:22:00,026
They also told them not to make too much noise in the wilderness. They told them not to make too much noise like this.

141
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:13,651
Only those who’ve gotten into accidents, they will make a lot of noise if they fall into water.

142
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:25,414
They also admonished us in the fall like this not to scream or make too much noise in the wilderness.

143
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:36,733
They said that only those who were helpless would make noise like that.

144
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:49,659
Then if they hear someone making noise or screaming, they would understand that he got into an accident or sunk into water.

145
00:22:51,084 --> 00:23:06,246
These days, however, since they are no longer admonished, since we no longer admonish you

146
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:09,022
They don’t know how to act anymore.

147
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:19,966
They also make a lot of noise and scream between villages.

148
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,948
They admonished against that.

149
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:35,136
So, I experienced that one time when I heard someone who had gotten into an accident.

150
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:45,155
Not long after Tuntutuliak was established as a village

151
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:54,486
When we were in Kelliq down there, and there were people upriver too.

152
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,280
You see this lake toward the water from this house.

153
00:24:02,462 --> 00:24:12,962
In the day like this toward the evening, someone was screaming inland from us, and I thought it was our inland neighbors.

154
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:18,569
It turned out he had fallen into the water down there.

155
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:33,531
One of the people going down saw him just as he was about to freeze when there was no village like this.

156
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:41,562
The people back then had a lot of admonishments.

157
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:48,419
They would tell them not to make noise like this.

158
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:57,019
Then, when they were also going to travel like this

159
00:25:00,506 --> 00:25:08,544
They would always say where they were going to go.

160
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:26,094
When they wouldn’t return like this, they would know that they had gotten into an accident.

161
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:40,300
When they travel with boats these days, however, they don’t say anything.

162
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:51,394
Then when they don’t return, they don’t know what happened because they didn’t say anything.

163
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:58,419
It’s because they don’t consider before traveling these days.

164
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:05,901
Or they say they’re going somewhere, then go to other villages.

165
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:13,207
That is what causes us confusion these days.

166
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:24,232
We don’t know what the next generation is doing.

167
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,495
Or we think they’re somewhere [else].

168
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:38,145
These days, even if they die in the wilderness, we have no idea about them.

169
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:50,995
You see, it’s because there are not a lot of things that bring us struggle these days.

170
00:26:53,783 --> 00:27:01,883
Now, the people back then were not like this.

171
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:07,302
They always observed everything.

172
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:23,721
And in the fall, they would always speak to us boys about our future, what we would experience, things they had experienced.

173
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:30,078
They would explain dangerous things, in the wilderness too.

174
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:47,847
And everyhing on this land, elevated hills, had names, and all of the creeks had names, and some lakes had names.

175
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:55,041
They knew they layout of the land.

176
00:27:55,148 --> 00:28:09,235
These days, however, since we are not pointing things out in the wilderness to our children anymore

177
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:17,198
They don’t know anything, including these river, and lakes, and these elevated spots.

178
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:32,129
And when they get something and are asked what area they got it from

179
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:41,710
Or if they lose where a person is, or a person gets lost as they do these days.

180
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:56,885
When they ask the person who saw him about the area he saw him, he doesn’t know its name.

181
00:28:56,891 --> 00:29:05,716
They only say, "Over there," because we don’t point those out to them anymore.

182
00:29:06,885 --> 00:29:14,997
We used to talk about everything, but we wouldn’t always use them.

183
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:19,685
But when we came upon them, we would recognize them.

184
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:30,192
Yes, a person must only live according to the traditional wisdom.

185
00:29:30,342 --> 00:29:42,867
If he does not abide by traditional wisdom, he will not live right, and he will have need of the things his peers work for.

186
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:58,348
They would talk to us like this back then: if we live using and abiding by this traditional wisdom, we will live well

187
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,642
Not being lazy, not sleeping too much.

188
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:10,179
They would promise us that.

189
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:22,617
However, we didn’t come upon the time they pointed out.

190
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:28,099
But when we come upon them these days, we recognize it.

191
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:34,024
That’s why they would talk to us like this back then:

192
00:30:35,211 --> 00:30:46,324
We should pay attention to someone who is talking to us and watch his mouth.

193
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:55,561
They said that if we look away from him, we’ll have no idea what he’s talking about anymore.

194
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:57,442
And indeed...
