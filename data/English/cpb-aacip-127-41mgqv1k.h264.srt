1
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,080
W-I-N-I-(F-R-E-D)

2
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,945
W-I-N-I?

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,670
What about your last name?

4
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:22,115
Beans.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,020
Beans? There are Beans [families], and also Bean [families].

6
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,545
Beans, yes, yes. (Beans.)

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,190
So, with those things

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:45,778
How will those who struggle with alcohol in our home villages

9
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:53,003
You know many say this: "He does not heed advice. He will stop getting advice."

10
00:00:53,015 --> 00:01:00,082
About that, please tell us how we can help those.

11
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:10,042
We know those who do wrong things like that, and not only with alcohol.

12
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:16,991
There are many, various ways to live wrong.

13
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:24,807
We should not think like this about those around us, you know, that [s]he is doing wrong.

14
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:30,154
"This one is difficult. He is unmanageable. Let him be."

15
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:32,887
We must not do that.

16
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:41,732
Now, my child, using myself as an example.

17
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:50,371
Now, my child lives without heeding any advice compared to their peers.

18
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:52,970
And people know it.

19
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,202
Though they are told, they’re very disobedient.

20
00:01:57,032 --> 00:02:03,176
Then since they are mine, I keep trying to tell them.

21
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:11,087
You know, since I love them, I will not say this, cannot say this:

22
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:15,305
"This one is unmanageable. Let them get out of my house here."

23
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:19,362
I will not say that.

24
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:23,609
They’re mine. They’re no one else’s.

25
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:31,788
I raised them as my child.

26
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:43,376
They will also be mine for however long I am alive, and how long they are alive.

27
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:49,868
Though they don’t listen, always instruct them, try to instruct them.

28
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:56,663
Starting from when they’re small, they tell us to try to instruct them.

29
00:02:57,147 --> 00:03:00,936
They tried to instruct me when I was small.

30
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,361
Turns out, they tried to instruct me though I was infuriated with them.

31
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:11,186
Sometimes in my mind, I’d be very infuriated with those who tried to instruct me.

32
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:14,713
But I didn’t talk back to them.

33
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:21,265
They already told me that one who talks back will be like this.

34
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:30,038
They also told me that one who is angered when being told will be like this.

35
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:41,030
You know, though I wasn’t big, and though I wasn’t active yet, I would be scared to be like that.

36
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:45,031
They already told me when I was small.

37
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:49,488
I also didn’t live obediently

38
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:54,688
But I would remember the traditional wisdom passed down to me.

39
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:04,464
If a person is like that, without forgetting their past

40
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:12,726
Though that one is disobedient, if one doesn’t give up, they are better than me.

41
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,537
Because [the child] is theirs.

42
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:28,166
We also hear about our food supplies, and even for us women, what we sew into our clothes

43
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:32,984
They said no one will do it for us. They said we’ll do it ourselves.

44
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:42,985
If our child is bad like that, and is disobedient, does wrong

45
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,991
It seems no one out there will do it for us.

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,345
Instead, we will try to [correct] them on our own.

47
00:04:53,355 --> 00:05:01,088
They said that the Yupiit back then had traditional wisdom about a boy.

48
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:05,371
They said a boy can change.

49
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:11,895
They said he shall be repulsed by his lifestyle.

50
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:21,500
They also said it would be especially so for the traditional wisdom [whose outcome] I feared when I became observant.

51
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:32,728
However, they said that if a woman is like that, it’s harder for her to change her life, her ways

52
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:39,161
You know, if we don’t try to change her from back when she was [small].

53
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:43,357
They said she would change like this.

54
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:54,615
You know, back when we didn’t choose our own husbands, when they didn’t choose their own husbands.

55
00:05:55,368 --> 00:06:00,334
They said that this would change her, and when she marries into another village.

56
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:06,380
They said that before long, she would take back her bad behavior.

57
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:18,037
[?Because of] that, they would try to advise and instruct us women from the beginning.

58
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:21,996
Now, also, this alcohol

59
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:29,905
Since this wrong way especially is getting stronger

60
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:39,709
To everyone, women, and men, girls, and boys

61
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:49,199
Since doing wrong is strengthened along with alcohol, it’s become more difficult.

62
00:06:49,837 --> 00:07:01,292
For us like that, though they’re disobedient like that, and they don’t listen about alcohol, speak to them.

63
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:10,834
And just because they had alcohol, when they sober up, don’t be infuriated with them where they can see.

64
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:16,220
Instead, show our love.

65
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:25,012
Try to let them know our love, you know, our motherly love.

66
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:35,312
Also, do not be infuriated with them while they’re drunk.

67
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:45,627
Also, if they do that in our home there while we’re with them, do not run away from them.

68
00:07:46,753 --> 00:07:54,575
They may try to act scary. They won’t do [anything] if they have no challengers.

69
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:03,121
Also, after they’ve been drinking

70
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:09,797
And, you know, though they do something bad in the house there, at least this is what I’m like:

71
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:14,292
Try not to run away from them, try not to leave them.

72
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,158
You know, I’m more scared of what might happen after I leave.

73
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:31,525
And if either is exasperated and we leave them to stay alone there, which will be exasperated?

74
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:38,198
Or else, they may take a weapon and try to hurt themself.

75
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:47,399
But I’ve always tried to stay there in my life, and in my spouse’s.

76
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:56,041
Also, the next day if my child had been drunk

77
00:08:56,464 --> 00:09:02,608
Comfort them the next day, and don’t scold them right away.

78
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:13,941
Comfort them as I used to by trying to make them happy, and ask what they’re going to do.

79
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:25,107
Don’t first bring up only his drinking the previous day, or his angry if he had gotten angry.

80
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:35,288
And if I had been scared, don’t bring those up, but comfor them.

81
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:42,098
And they also say, and I see them, when they’re hungover, yuussugluki.

82
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:46,871
And one of them seems to be irritable while hungover.

83
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:55,084
Only when they’re not like that anymore, when they have fun, and start to speak well

84
00:09:55,096 --> 00:10:01,685
And they don’t seem to speak well when hungover.

85
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:12,384
Only when they start speaking well, and don’t expect it anymore

86
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:20,228
Then we should tell him what had happened the day before or whenever.

87
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:25,495
And don’t scold them, but speak to them kindly.

88
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:35,464
Explain, thoroughly explain, how you were scared, and how you were scared to leave them.

89
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,168
Don’t scold them.

90
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:46,158
One of them will be very regretful then.

91
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:49,336
They will be regretful.

92
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:53,883
Say you love them, and show your love.

93
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:59,897
"Because I love you, I stayed here since I didn’t want you to do this."

94
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,344
I spoke about my thoughts.

95
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:20,138
"You also say you love me. If you truly love me," you know, tell them not to do that again.

96
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:25,230
Also, always pray for them.

97
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,852
Ask for them not to do that, that they shall not do that.

98
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:37,421
I do not have my children to wish them to do that in my mind.

99
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:43,393
But always pray for them, to ask on their behalf.

100
00:11:43,405 --> 00:11:52,661
Probably since our children do not always want to listen to those

101
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:57,928
And they stop going to church and don’t want to travel.

102
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:08,518
In spite of that, I tell them to believe.

103
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:15,340
Also, when I instruct random people, and even when I instruct my children

104
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:20,918
I tell them to believe.

105
00:12:21,411 --> 00:12:32,453
Anyone who works hard for something, especially works for alcohol, and even one who works for smoking

106
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:41,169
It seems they must have faith in something to help them to me.

107
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:49,296
Though a person goes with absolutely no faith, they will have no strength.

108
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:54,395
Believe one or the other.

109
00:12:54,503 --> 00:13:01,136
The church, believe in the ways of the church.

110
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:06,060
And if you can’t believe in the ways of the church

111
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:13,824
Yupiit speak of things that are no different from the commandments of the church.

112
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:21,126
Believe in Yup’ik wisdom if you don’t want to believe in the church’s ways.

113
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:29,348
Try to believe in, practice, and obey Yup’ik wisdom.

114
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:38,220
A Yup’ik, you know, who has gotten older will not be perturbed if a person asks them

115
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:47,792
If one asks them about traditional instructions, and advice for the future, to me, they will be very, very thankful.

116
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:51,947
If one asks them that, they will be happy to me.

117
00:13:52,344 --> 00:14:02,288
Now, though I’ve stopped worked, when people ask me, I am completely thankful from inside in my heart.

118
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:07,510
A little piece of Yup’ik wisdom

119
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:15,190
Especially not that I’ve become an old woman, it truly seems that that Yup’ik wisdom has come to be stronger.

120
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:20,890
It’s because they’re no different from the church’s Bible.

121
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:31,130
They are very strong and good pieces of wisdom to me, those pieces of Yup’ik wisdom, instructions.

122
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:36,038
That’s why I said that.

123
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:43,428
Also, as I’ve lived up to now, my children are now grown.

124
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:47,224
And they’re not with me, making their own living.

125
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:56,936
I tell them not to worry, but they also do not ignore me.

126
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:04,058
And now that we have phones, they always call me on the phone.

127
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:08,323
And it’s clear that they try to keep me from [not] having a phone.

128
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:18,691
When they call me on the phone like this, and when they tell me not to worry about them

129
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:23,129
I tell them this:

130
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:31,245
"What will I worry about you other than alcohol?"

131
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:40,885
To me, there is nothing to worry about other than alcohol

132
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,269
You know, if they’re not sick.

133
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:52,753
Then I also tell them again that I don’t want them to be alcoholic.

134
00:15:52,760 --> 00:16:00,038
I also don’t want their mothers, my children with children, to be alcoholic.

135
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:08,760
I try to [?show] them many bad things, I am not good.

136
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:12,727
I tried to raise them [?by showing them].

137
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:19,602
I tried not to drink alcohol, and tried to take them to church.

138
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:24,975
Then when they tell me on the phone, I tell them

139
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:34,106
Or when they had been drinking the previous day, these men must especially be told.

140
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:38,559
When I tell them, I say

141
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:47,112
"Because I love you, I’ve never drank alcohol since I didn’t want you to feel helpless."

142
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:52,956
Also because they see their peers with alcoholic parents.

143
00:16:52,969 --> 00:17:01,569
Also because they bring [children] out of compassion and want to eat with them, saying their mom and daddy are drunk.

144
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:08,841
I would be very thankful for their compassion.

145
00:17:10,102 --> 00:17:14,069
That’s what I would tell them.

146
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:21,937
"Because I love you, I did not try to make you feel helpless as I raised you.

147
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,941
"Repay me out of great love

148
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:39,287
"Think of me, and try not to abuse that alcohol that I don’t want you to get into."

149
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:45,304
That’s what I tell them, to repay me like that.

150
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:50,014
To those who love a child

151
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:56,554
And we also scold our children.

152
00:17:56,556 --> 00:18:00,278
You know, I did that when they were with me.

153
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:04,350
Yet we love them, yet we shouldn’t keep from scolding them.

154
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:12,486
After scolding them, comfort them again, showing my love.

155
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:18,442
And I tell them about what I scolded about, "Because I don’t want you to do that."

156
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,965
Especially these days, they’ve become more difficult like this.

157
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:36,642
It truly seems that these poor people are in between our Yup’ik and Western ways.

158
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:43,213
It seems my grandchildren here are in between them.

159
00:18:43,713 --> 00:18:54,713
In spite of that, and in places here, our grandchildren are starting to speak only in English, at least my grandchidlren are.

160
00:18:55,228 --> 00:19:02,883
I do instruct them in some places here as fluently as I can.

161
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,306
And it truly seems that it shows they don’t want to listen.

162
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:12,248
Or, they even show that they don’t think things are true.

163
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:18,810
But though they do that, we must try with them.

164
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:27,400
Also, we must especially not do that just because they don’t want to listen.

165
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:36,961
Though they don’t listen, they will someday have regrets about one that encouraged them.

166
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:42,622
Someday, they will think that they were treated with love.

167
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:56,128
When I was growing up, I used to think that those who instructed me like that didn’t love me.

168
00:19:57,574 --> 00:20:01,808
It turned out, they instructed me out of love.

169
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:08,310
Considering that, I always try to instruct them.

170
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:11,694
And even when they’re random people here

171
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:23,546
You know, because they knew I was a counselor, they come to me back home.

172
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:30,661
And when they’re sad, or even when they’re not children, or even when they’re adults.

173
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:43,412
With those that ask me, I am very embarrassed inside, you know, because I don’t feel capable when someone comes to me for advice.

174
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:48,467
I am completely embarrassed as I do my best with them.

175
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:57,519
I am not ashamed of my life, and I am not ashamed of how improper my children were.

176
00:20:57,524 --> 00:21:00,224
I also use that as an example.

177
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:04,483
It’s because, poor thing, if that person has no one to tell them

178
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:12,358
If they think they’re the only ones like that, they will not try to be good.

179
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:17,520
I also talk about my children

180
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:25,399
Always doing well, a mother always doing well and having fun

181
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:33,471
She will not have these children that she’s thankful for, or raise them [always doing well].

182
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:42,578
She will likely live sometimes being sad, sometimes struggling.

183
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,789
This is not to instill fear.

184
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:53,438
But since I’ve experienced it, I talked about how it’s like that.

185
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:54,627
How was that?

186
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Okay.

187
00:21:58,053 --> 00:22:00,086
Oh, it’s going to run out.
