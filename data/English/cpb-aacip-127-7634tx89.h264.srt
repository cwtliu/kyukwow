1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,380
...what they were going to do.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,650
And I’d say, "Oh no, I won’t appear on TV."

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:14,770
It turned out that looking at these [people] in our day, it’s distressing.

4
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:19,265
If we stay without saying anything, we won’t [accomplish] anything.

5
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:25,161
I will want to ask you questions. I will ask you, or as we go, I’ll tell you.

6
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:32,076
You said that a long time ago, we didn’t have any [Western] things (Yes, yes.) didn’t have anything [?]. (We were destitute.)

7
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:38,723
How is our relations, you know, we who are related to each other

8
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,270
How is has us being too Westernized affected our relations? Those...

9
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:48,946
Are we rolling? (Yes.) Okay.

10
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,968
Let’s see, how shall I say it?

11
00:00:51,970 --> 00:01:00,770
In your observation, are our relations, how these families interact with [cultural] relations

12
00:01:01,803 --> 00:01:06,813
Is their abundance of wealth negatively affecting it, or how?

13
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:14,594
Just your observation. And if you haven’t thought about it, it’s okay if you don’t speak on it.

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,280
I have no idea.

15
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:21,157
What was I saying again?

16
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:29,826
Oh yes, also [?to diligentely do things] in the house...

17
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,159
(Daughter’s places.) Oh, daughters. (Yes.)

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:39,530
Yes, then because those people back then used to say this, I remember:

19
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:47,233
Our female children can copy what we mothers work on.

20
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:49,392
It’s true.

21
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:59,289
If I keep sewing, my daughters can copy it, and sew.

22
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:04,121
But these days, this schooling is such a conundrum.

23
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:12,972
I will not praise my children. I can use them as examples.

24
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:22,024
I also have one child now who goes to college. It’s been many years now.

25
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:25,508
[S]he would drop out, as they call it.

26
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:30,568
Look at these, what’s going on with them?

27
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:42,390
And, you see, [s]he’s living without knowing how to work.

28
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:48,143
And [s]he never wants to work, only read.

29
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:54,309
Then also as an example, it’s okay to use them as examples.

30
00:02:54,733 --> 00:03:00,403
One of my children would be disinclined to go to school.

31
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:08,496
He loved being active. The boy liked to work, outside work.

32
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:15,607
I know that he liked to pack ice when he was small.

33
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,970
He never let me go without water. He was never lazy.

34
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:26,901
I would keep telling him to, you know, because he was my only provider.

35
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:38,088
I see him these days, knowing really well how to work, outside too.

36
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:52,188
From the start, without waiting to become a man, but one who keeps doing it from the start will train himself as they say in English.

37
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:57,459
I can also make an example of that with one of my children.

38
00:03:57,622 --> 00:04:04,612
Now, he’s the youngest, the youngest out of my many children.

39
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:10,967
I depend on him to do outside chores.

40
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,330
He would work like an adult, knowing really well.

41
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:20,957
There you have it.

42
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:24,846
I’m telling these stories as examples.

43
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:31,066
We can learn things through what we see through our eyes.

44
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:42,547
You know, my mother never used to clean up, only sew.

45
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:45,797
It was because there was nothing to clean up in our house.

46
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:51,882
But I just said that at Cakayak and his spouse’s, since they were Caucasian, [?they’d find things amiss?].

47
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:55,934
But it was like it is here. There were no phones.

48
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:58,909
Did they have TV’s?

49
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:05,122
I speak of those, what I learned of those from them.

50
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:12,908
When I went to school, it seemed that I didn’t learn anything. It was because my schooling was too little, too scant.

51
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:21,266
Even though I suffered wanting to go to school right away, my age, since they used to get husbands young back then.

52
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:25,511
They had me take a husband, and I was young.

53
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,350
And when we were going to get a marriage license here

54
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:36,689
That one who issued marriage licenses was called a commissioner.

55
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:42,635
Sometimes now, I say, "That darned official lied."

56
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:47,393
I was 16. I think I was 16.

57
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,200
After he said he couldn’t give us the marriage license, he wrote on it and brought it.

58
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:58,871
He falsely stated that I was 18 and gave us the marriage license.

59
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:01,771
He added to my age.

60
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,539
Now, I go by that, how my age was increased.

61
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:10,846
I’m certainly younger than that.

62
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:20,828
But since, you know, they could use marriage licenses as proof, they fixed it with those documents when my spouse passed away.

63
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,040
I talk about that.

64
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:30,884
Apparently, the people back then would add years in the past.

65
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:37,186
These days, becoming an old woman, or a man takes a wife as an old man.

66
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:42,153
Or a woman takes a husband as an old woman these days.

67
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:49,017
Back then, did our ancestors think it was important for a child to get married?

68
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:57,247
Probably because they thought it important, my parents would have others encourage me [to marry] as well.

69
00:06:57,258 --> 00:07:10,048
Look, back then, they would choose their husbands, examining their potential spouse’s behavior, and how much he works.

70
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,720
You know, they wouldn’t choose a dumb man.

71
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:20,503
These days, I should name it "tamian" [dumb man].

72
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:26,428
Some take husbands, and their husband doesn’t know how to do anything.

73
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:30,274
I’m not lying. Am I lying?

74
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:36,150
Or a man takes a [kazy] wife. There you have it.

75
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:42,103
I will not keep from talking about these true things.

76
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:46,882
Apparently, my parents sought a husband for me.

77
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:55,430
It turned out that my groom to be was young and was an expert in doing things. Nick, Nick O’Nick.

78
00:07:57,223 --> 00:08:00,123
And when I married him, he was very young.

79
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:08,378
On our marriage license, our ages were, Nick 22, and me 18, when we got married.

80
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:18,680
My mother used to tell me this: I should work with him without being lazy. "He will provide for us."

81
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:22,403
She said my husband will provide for us.

82
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:27,969
My older brother got impaired with TB and couldn’t do anything.

83
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:38,746
And because I would be worried about my older brother, and when he dies... you see, we would ponder.

84
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:43,226
Though I was young, I’d ponder [upon such things].

85
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:52,232
And I’d think like this: my older brothers wife, "Do it, okay," because she encouraged me.

86
00:08:52,972 --> 00:09:02,012
Then I started thinking like this, that I wouldn’t, because I loved someone else, being in love.

87
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:11,294
As [they] say these days, I’d probably say that I was loving another.

88
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:16,354
That other one was attractive. You see, I loved him.

89
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:22,064
Without having met my groom to be, however, I was intimidated by him.

90
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:31,207
Then because my mother, you see, would say to me, "He will proved for us. Look, our provider there can’t do anything."

91
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:33,182
Sometimes, you see...

92
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:39,500
They’d also tell us this: we should sit down and ponder for a while.

93
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,430
I would do that.

94
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:52,865
Sometimes, you see, I’d ponder like this: "If my older brother over there who’d tell me what to do dies, I will regret it."

95
00:09:52,877 --> 00:10:00,227
You know, I already know how to worry at 16, as a little girl.

96
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:02,699
I’d go out to visit a lot.

97
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:08,154
You see, I would think like that. Then one day, I agreed.

98
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:14,904
Oh my, when I married him, you see, I was intimidated by my spouse.

99
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:20,461
I’d go to bed fully clothed like this beside him.

100
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:26,547
You know, they apparently undress and put on gowns or something to go to bed.

101
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:31,886
I’d go to bed fully clothed next to my spouse.

102
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:33,371
You see...

103
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:42,059
To my family downriver since they were downriver, and my husband upriver, upriver in a little village.

104
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:43,858
You know, they split inland.

105
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,850
When I’d go downriver to my family, I’d be reluctant to go back, you know, I wouldn’t want to return.

106
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:53,404
My mother would end up saying to me, "Go home already."

107
00:10:53,648 --> 00:11:01,128
When I’d get tired, I’d go out. My mindset was, as they say in English, smash[ed].

108
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:05,137
Pity me, I’d go upriver to my husband’s.

109
00:11:05,194 --> 00:11:16,384
I’d start going in, you see, to absolute silence. I’d go in and he’d already be in bed. I was so shameless. I was so shameless.

110
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:25,251
Then since I knew my spouse was lying here, I went to bed fully clothed beside him.

111
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:29,481
Oh my, when I married him and they got me, I went in, you see...

112
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:39,119
These days, a man takes a wife and doesn’t give anything to his wife.

113
00:11:39,377 --> 00:11:42,857
I went in, you see, I think they used to do it long ago.

114
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,110
You see, there were these two huge cardboard boxes.

115
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:54,586
Then,you see, that girl, my husband’s older brother’s child, would take things out from there.

116
00:11:54,596 --> 00:12:03,116
Their mother [said], "Look, there’s your bed." The bed, you see, was good things, good blankets, all new.

117
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:06,906
I was going to start the beginning.

118
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:11,488
They used to give them things like that.

119
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:17,598
You see, that girl would give me things from those cardboard [boxes].

120
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:23,235
She took out and gave me an atkuk, [a] fur parka.

121
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:27,518
You know, these days, fur parkas are expensive.

122
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,170
They were overwhelming.

123
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:36,107
She gave me a parka. And she put it by me, but I wasn’t thankful.

124
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:39,377
You know, because I didn’t want to take a husband.

125
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:46,074
After that, she also took out piluguuk, fur mukluks.

126
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:49,151
I took them and put them beside me.

127
00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:54,623
You see, there were many things. [S]he gave them to me like that.

128
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:57,652
There you have it.

129
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:04,854
Then my spouse didn’t do that there in his family’s home.

130
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:10,772
They took me in the fall. The next spring, I didn’t want to go back with my family.

131
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,343
I used to do that.

132
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:20,906
And when I didn’t want to go back, my spouse wanted to move with me to a spring camp. I wouldn’t.

133
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:23,932
He left me and went.

134
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:29,582
Then I got happier with my family.

135
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:39,236
When he arrived in the spring, these people said that my husband was going to come to me and move in with my family.

136
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:44,752
When he did that, I was, you know, thankful.

137
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:49,191
Now again, my mother used to say to me, "He’ll be our provider."

138
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,210
He was going to come and move to take care of us.

139
00:13:53,228 --> 00:14:02,408
Since I knew that, you know, I started [treating] him well, also because I used to always have my back turned to him.

140
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:09,051
And I started looking at him sometimes. He was very intimidating.

141
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:13,965
They may have been reserved around each other. I did that.

142
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,993
Then he moved in with us.

143
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:26,742
Oh my, I also didn’t get pregnenat right away because I wouldn’t let him touch me, and would go to bed and shut out the world.

144
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:34,276
And some mornings, my mother would say this to me: "Don’t harshly raise your hand."

145
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:41,190
Probably, you see... you know, men know that women raise their hands a certain way.

146
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:50,798
Sometimes, when he brought his arm like this, I would do this out of dislike.

147
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:55,124
My mother [said to me], "They don’t do that." It was because I didn’t know.

148
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,046
Evidently, everything has rules.

149
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:04,757
She said they don’t do that.

150
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:09,949
She said a man takes a wife to fool around with her.

151
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,247
I would get scared.

152
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:17,764
Then, you see, I was pregnant with Robert Nick, my child to be inland.

153
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:25,475
I got pregnant. When I got pregnant, you see, I finally started facing my husband face to face.

154
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,257
Nick is so wonderful.

155
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:38,753
Then when I got pregnant like that, I finally observed him [with] a Bible.

156
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:44,100
You see, my husband was always busy.

157
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:51,402
It turned out that it was because my parents’ choice was a hard worker.

158
00:15:52,877 --> 00:15:59,697
[He] started always reading the Bible. He would always read the Bible every evening.

159
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:06,294
Then we had two children, Robert, Margaret, I think.

160
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:09,842
He became a pastor [at a] young [age].

161
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:16,940
He turned out to be wonderful. I can say how good he was.

162
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:21,856
He wouldn’t play out. We used to play out.

163
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:27,201
Now, there are places to play like [the] Teen Center, and others.

164
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:32,562
And when I’d go play, I’d never see my groom to be.

165
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:40,310
You see, since he was like that from the beginning, my parents wanted me to have him.

166
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:51,193
He started always reading the Bible. And not long after, he became a pastor. He became a pastor at a young age in Nunapitchuk.

167
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:55,622
And recently, he died while he was a pastor.

168
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:59,296
And he had nine children.

169
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:03,527
Wow, you see, he had such passion for that.

170
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:10,117
And while he was a pastor, me made that little trading post inland.

171
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:21,440
Before makiung it, he said he first went to the priests, the Moravian priests, and he said he also went to the priest in Kwethluk.

172
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:29,431
He was very knowledgeable, and he had absolutely no schooling.

173
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:38,831
Apparently, he asked them about working along with the trading post while he was a pastor.

174
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,050
And they gave him the okay.

175
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:52,828
That [place] inland was made only after being advised by those, Nick O’Nick Trading Post, these knowledgeable priests.

176
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,493
That’s what we were like.

177
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:10,159
Then we raised our children like that.

178
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:16,254
And he never did this even once with alcohol.

179
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:22,955
We went [to the city] over there several times after he’d gotten his trading post.

180
00:18:25,258 --> 00:18:33,628
Though some have absolutely no schooling, they are very smart, will be very knowledgeable.

181
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:40,023
Now, I am not praising him, but speaking with him as an example.

182
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:51,446
When we’d go over there, Caucasians these days apparently use a little alcohol to make friends.

183
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:56,578
Then when this person comes in, "You want [a] drink?"

184
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:07,223
Over there, we’d walk among his fellow workers with businesses.

185
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:13,621
Then when we appeared, after he was struggling, "Nick you want [a] drink?" they’d say to him.

186
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:20,236
"No." When he said "no," those very knowledgeable people would say "sorry."

187
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:23,048
"I’m sorry, Nick."

188
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:27,949
Then after saying that, they’d end with: "Nick, you’re lucky."

189
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:31,075
And they’d say that to him.

190
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:37,904
I’m speaking of these because I will not hold back speaking of them since they’re good.

191
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:41,733
That’s how we went [through life].

192
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:52,208
His tradin gpost, let me skip it. It’s okay. Somehow, I’ll speak about it sometime somehow.

193
00:19:52,218 --> 00:19:59,908
Nick never used to work. And he didn’t work anywhere.

194
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:03,664
He was a fur hunter, [a] fur hunter.

195
00:20:03,846 --> 00:20:06,586
He was a fur hunter.

196
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,380
Then, he stated his trading post inland with that.

197
00:20:12,397 --> 00:20:17,057
He used to say this, I never forget some of what he said to me:

198
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:24,785
He said that at that time, he sold his fur here, probably to fur buyers.

199
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:30,510
He said he got $700 for them.

200
00:20:30,524 --> 00:20:36,334
Then using that, he arrived with little things.

201
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:38,649
Can I skip that too?

202
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:49,370
But our children’s parents were apparently teachers.

203
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:55,826
A woman’s daughter, a woman’s daughter can be like her.

204
00:20:55,838 --> 00:21:01,638
And a man’s son can watch him and do what he does.

205
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:09,613
My male children here are not like their father.

206
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:14,229
I’m not lying. I’m speaking of it without lying.

207
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:25,882
But our eldest brother over there, because he adheres to his traditional instructions, is working at [the trading post] inland, probably.

208
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:28,716
I don’t know what he’s like.

209
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:34,782
But I really like our older brother. He’s wonderful, you see.

210
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:38,313
He cares for us, you see.

211
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:43,225
And he takes great care of his brothers and sisters.

212
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:53,837
Without praising him, I’m speaking of him to show how families are raised differently, and children.

213
00:21:54,784 --> 00:22:05,714
This cleaning up the home was especially prevalent in my mind lately as I was going to [be interviewed] like this.

214
00:22:08,003 --> 00:22:16,448
And those dishes and what to cook, a woman, a girl, [?] her mother...
