1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,050
They say that when that guest arrived and told a story that someone from a far away village somewhere had passed away

2
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,000
They said that that village would mourn with loud wails over him.

3
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:35,475
I wonder why he said this, and I recognize it now:

4
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:42,910
"Later, when the world is going to end, people will die off more quickly.

5
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,550
"They will also start hurting themselves."

6
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:57,290
And he said that they will no longer mourn loudly anymore, but laugh at them instead.

7
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:05,325
They said that when the world is close to ending, we people will all become foolish.

8
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,700
I used to hear this. It’s probably true. I recognize it.

9
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:13,415
When I used to hear of it far off [in the future], my heart would skip a beat.

10
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:20,285
And I am worse than those who do wrong, by abusing alcohol.

11
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:27,615
I heavily abused alcohol, and it would be the only thing on my mind when I was coming back from the wilderness.

12
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:34,315
I realized that I was destroying my precious body of my own accord.

13
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,980
And my regret to this day is that I used to do that in front of my children here.

14
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,440
I taught them [to do that].

15
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:48,885
That is my greatest regret today.

16
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,690
And I am heartbroken

17
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,520
Because I taught them this detrimental thing that would destroy me when I reached this age.

18
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:10,855
Indeed, what those people said back then is quite true.

19
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:44,170
They said that the descendants of our descendants will establish what people will be like on this earth.

20
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:47,455
They will establish it.

21
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:52,245
Then they said that their descendants

22
00:02:52,449 --> 00:03:04,774
It seems that people are starting to do this these days.

23
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:09,643
It seems they spoke watching [the future].

24
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:14,506
It turned out that when I reached this age, I would remember them.

25
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:22,163
It seemed that they spoke of it watching the future people of these lands.

26
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:30,457
Pity, they said, when they reach that point where they will become like that

27
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:37,920
Even their young people will become like puppies.

28
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:40,014
You see?

29
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:45,583
Now, I fully understand them.

30
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:53,690
It seemed that the people back then truly watched this time as they spoke of it.

31
00:03:53,834 --> 00:04:01,684
Oh my goodness, and people have reached that point, every person from the lands.

32
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:06,753
And without leaving any out, all of the lands have come to that point.

33
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:17,029
They said they will definitely become like that when young people depreciate their traditional wisdom.

34
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:51,554
Because I grew up in the wilderness back then, I would eat everything when it started to grow in the spring when I started playing outside.

35
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:55,923
RIght when I started playing outside, I would eat [?cungakvak] roots.

36
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,892
I am not ashamed, and even tell these to my children.

37
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:05,718
But the only thing I didn’t eat was poison water hemlock.

38
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,630
And I found tree leaves tasty.

39
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:16,312
When I became an adult, I found that I wouldn’t get tired. I’ve never been tired, you see.

40
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:22,862
I haven’t been tired, but I get short of breath when I run.

41
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:30,624
And when I started working, I found that though my peers said they were tired, I haven’t been tired.

42
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,293
And I don’t get cold often.

43
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:40,730
And though my peers dressed very wamrly, I didn’t dress warmly. I grew up without dressing warmly.

44
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:45,874
And my mom would stop after trying to have me dress warmly.

45
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:55,655
These plants are truly beneficial for the body.

46
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:26,986
If you want to live right, you must not preside over yourself

47
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:40,155
And even though you live as an adult like that, you must be mindful, you must think of some belief.

48
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:47,955
You must believe in God’s will.

49
00:06:49,049 --> 00:07:01,974
Then if you can’t do that, you must believe in traditional Yup’ik instruction.

50
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:14,955
If you live life all by yourself without any form of faith, thinking that you’re smart, prideful of yourself

51
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:19,855
I don’t know how you’ll end up.

52
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:56,299
This traditional wisdom is how God takes care of all people, all people on this earth.

53
00:07:57,368 --> 00:08:05,943
So that’s why when the weather is bad, they say that the weather is bad when it’s good

54
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:11,187
Because apparently, this is what bad weather is like:

55
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:21,631
Because it’s bad weather when it stops raining

56
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:29,412
Stopping everything, including plants, from growing well.

57
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:41,850
Because it stops raining and getting foggy, keeping moistrure from the land here.

58
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:57,563
Then, this is also considered bad weather for the West, these people who eat crops.

59
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:10,420
Before this, we hear that they have a famine when their crops don’t grow well

60
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:14,789
And many starve to death.

61
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:22,227
And sometimes, we hear about people having water shortages.

62
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:30,965
That is how God takes care of us.

63
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:41,540
And those elders used to say that something here

64
00:09:52,622 --> 00:10:00,247
And it’s no wonder that they say that even blackfish become scarce like this.

65
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:12,178
It turns out that God does this when he looks at people’s behavior and disapproves.

66
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:20,822
He apprently does that depending on their behav ior when they become too foolish

67
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:25,528
So that they will realize their wrong behavior.

68
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:53,809
He causes those who eat crops to have a shortage of crops

69
00:10:53,815 --> 00:11:00,565
And those who eat from rivers to have a shortage of river [animals].

70
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:14,834
We know that plants grow on the earth between cold and hot temperatures.

71
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:23,897
The other will keep them from growing well if they are not in harmony.

72
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:30,997
Our food sources from the water are also like that.

73
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:42,716
It seems they are also between cold and hot in their little environments.

74
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:50,435
That bad weather that brings about famine shows that.

75
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:54,204
It shows that.

76
00:11:54,217 --> 00:12:03,329
So that’s why they say even little blackfish become scarce during a famine.

77
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:13,417
Those that show the signs of famine, show the signs.

78
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,118
They say there are two types of famine.

79
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:48,381
The other is a male, and the other is a female.

80
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:53,518
They say in the male, summer comes later.

81
00:12:56,687 --> 00:13:01,499
They say, however, that in the female, summer comes earlier.

82
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:09,787
They say bad weather happens in all of the world, not just experienced by a few lands.

83
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:14,868
Instead, all lands experience it.

84
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:24,793
I think they’d say that the one of our time was a female one.

85
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:31,374
Also, many people starved to death

86
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:36,250
And some villages became ghost towns.

87
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:50,887
That’s probably why people, even if it’s not every last person, the ones who are alive relocate.

88
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:55,168
They also said that the dogs die off first.

89
00:13:57,031 --> 00:14:01,143
Some villages start having bad people.

90
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:14,194
They also said that when bad weather is nigh, the starts at the end of the night become smoky.

91
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:19,488
They also said that the world would “crack."

92
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:29,375
They said that it crackles as it "cracks," with the side areas having saw-like teeth.

93
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:37,831
They say that the people who starved are looking down.

94
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:44,925
They also say that many people notice when it cracks.

95
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,250
You see, these are the signs that they spoke about.

96
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:30,069
They say that when bad weather is getting close

97
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:41,457
There’ll be no more people talking about what famine is like, and they will sit and wait for others to work for them.

98
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:52,213
Also, because we who were born in time to see them do not speak about what we used to hear

99
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:58,844
As Paul said in the Bible.

100
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:07,963
And I didn’t receive anything from the ancestors. They’re probably ancestors.

101
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:20,144
We who were born in time to see them must be the mouths for what they said

102
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:27,326
What they used to say about these young people.

103
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:40,014
Without having heard what that’s like, how will the people who reach that time use the traditional instructions concerning it?

104
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:53,745
They say that though bad weather is nigh, there isn’t a complete lack of food sources.

105
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:59,777
But they said that their food sources seem to [deplete] quickly.

106
00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:08,389
And at what point in the winter do blizzards become frequent?

107
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:16,795
They say the weather isn’t good, with blizzards happening all the time.

108
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,908
And a person does not travel anywhere with good paths.

109
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:38,471
Sometimes, after dawn breaks on a wonderful day, the wind shifts and the weather turns bad long before the day is over.

110
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:49,196
And the men who subsist cannot subsist well.

111
00:17:50,208 --> 00:18:04,646
They also say that blackfish traps are filled with frost.

112
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:10,146
When they take them out of the water, they clang.

113
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:16,172
The frost in the fish traps clang.

114
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:25,203
Sometimes, there is one blackfish visible among the frost.

115
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:37,954
There in the water, the cold may be coming into contact with them.

116
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:48,235
These days, there is no frost in the currents.

117
00:18:52,273 --> 00:19:01,523
There seems to be frost in the currents during famines.

118
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:27,730
Instead, he brought home a blackfish

119
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:39,892
Then when he brought it home, he filled a pot with water to try to have it swim

120
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:46,536
With the mind to make the water a little cloudy.

121
00:19:47,511 --> 00:20:01,224
Then when it got cloudy, he cooked it.

122
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:15,486
When it got cloudy, they cooked it. The family ate it.

123
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:27,061
They broke apart one blackfish and added mare’s-tails, tall cottongrass tubers, and sourdock.

124
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:33,255
Apparently, they would eat one mare’s-tail.

125
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:43,618
They were also afraid of having no fish roe.

126
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:52,900
Dried fish roe does not spoil no matter how old they get.

127
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:57,844
They made those in day old blackfish stews.

128
00:20:58,144 --> 00:21:13,994
They also said that even if they take solid or watery ptarmigan feces and eat it, their stomach will not be upset from it.

129
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:20,176
They said it’s because it’s [?clean] since they eat trees.

130
00:21:43,270 --> 00:22:00,145
If one sees a blackfish fry, a small blackfish, in a fishing hole in the ice or a place where the ice was picked out

131
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:08,351
Though his stomach rumbles, they say that he shouldn’t covet it.

132
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:14,770
They that he should instead bring it home, cook it, and eat it.

133
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:26,621
They have this traditional wisdom concerning that small blackfish:

134
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:40,208
Because if he eats it raw, they say their stomach "shoots an arrow" at such wonderful contents, and kills himself.

135
00:22:41,352 --> 00:22:54,602
They say that when a person’s stomach has no more fat, it becomes volatile, and shouldn’t be given anything bad.

136
00:22:58,096 --> 00:23:06,946
He should take care not to eat too much oil or fat, or eating too much.

137
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:18,428
People were evidently strong back then when water wasn’t their food source.

138
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:34,460
Because those who were subsisting were so skinny, they would stuff their anuses when they were going to travel

139
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:40,741
Because they get drafty since they’re so skinny.

140
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:21,672
This dangerous summer has appeared now.

141
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,604
We also wander through the water now.

142
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:36,110
This misfortune that alcohol brings

143
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:44,136
And how it destroys people

144
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:48,611
It’s time we’ve realized this.

145
00:24:48,623 --> 00:24:55,286
It’s also time that those who’ve abused it realized this.

146
00:24:55,611 --> 00:25:05,323
But it’s unfortunate that those who want to use it abuse it, though he is told not to.

147
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:13,499
They practice what they value.

148
00:25:15,036 --> 00:25:20,786
These days, a person is like this:

149
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:32,305
After being spoken to, after he stands without doing anything as he’s spoken to

150
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:38,249
Then when he goes, he drinks.

151
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:48,768
And before an hour is up, one falls from his boat because he [drank] too much

152
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,706
And the boat leaves him.

153
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:57,500
And he can’t be saved by any means.

154
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:04,356
He kills himself. That is very clear.

155
00:26:05,138 --> 00:26:08,700
He kills himself.

156
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:24,413
It truly seems that it is no different from shooting oneself, or stabbing oneself with a knife, or hanging oneself.

157
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:28,720
It’s no different.

158
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:37,008
When he falls into the water [drunk], he kills himself.

159
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:41,345
I want people to understand this now.

160
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:47,995
Though I am a bad person, turn away from me

161
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:54,033
I want them to turn away from me and remember this

162
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:59,720
And I want these precious young people to understand it

163
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:06,701
Their behaviours that make them destroy themselves.

164
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:45,389
And their parents, their parents take care of them when they’re children out of love.

165
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:49,433
But when they stand by themselves

166
00:27:49,564 --> 00:28:00,089
Some of them truly seems as if they raised themselves

167
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:08,095
And they disparage their parents and do not respect them.

168
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:14,789
They also don’t remember or heed what they said.

169
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:27,102
And because they don’t heed them, they give their parents shame

170
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,859
That terrible thing.

171
00:28:32,684 --> 00:28:44,346
They make them ashamed, like they pay their parents back the wrong way.

172
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:53,947
If they understand their behavior and they give up the alcohol they are prone to abusing

173
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:58,584
That would be greatly beneficial.

174
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:06,003
And one who gives it up is cause for great thanks.

175
00:29:06,122 --> 00:29:14,122
These are also the examples for those who abuse alcohol:

176
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:28,666
Some people, from what I’ve seen, are heavily alcoholic until eventually he grows up, and he eventually takes a wife.

177
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:39,166
Then as they go, some of them gives up their alcoholic behavior.

178
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:44,060
They don’t repeatedly take it up, but give it up and turn away from it.

179
00:29:44,154 --> 00:29:58,341
Oh my goodness, even though we don’t always say it, we are so thankful for them in our minds.

180
00:29:58,354 --> 00:30:03,041
This is all I’m going to say about this.

181
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:37,104
During that time, they traveled with kayaks.

182
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:50,254
Then when the wind starts blowing on them, they also had thin pullover garments made of bearded seal intestines

183
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:55,555
The seal gut pullovers that they put on.

184
00:30:55,668 --> 00:31:02,205
With those, the kayak rims, you know how they’re round?

185
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:07,368
Did you see kayaks before? You know how they’re round?

186
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,868
He puts the kayak rim inside his hem.

187
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:23,268
Then they would bind it with something that wasn’t twine, but handmade ropes of spiraled sealskin. They called that securing it with a cord, "ket’garluku".

188
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:31,656
Though the waves do this to him, it can’t go in his kayak.

189
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:36,112
That’s what they used to do.

190
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:42,087
The water can’t go into his kayak because he’s holding it [secure] with his garment.

191
00:31:42,343 --> 00:31:51,568
Then these boats haven’t sunk.

192
00:31:51,749 --> 00:32:03,299
But this thing that they abuse leads them to misfortune.

193
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:09,606
What is called alcohol is what brings them to misfortune.

194
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:14,800
When there was none of that, there was no one who got into misfortune.

195
00:32:14,894 --> 00:32:22,782
We didn’t hear of people getting into misfortune in the summer, those who drowned.

196
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:34,657
People from every village do not want young people to abuse this [alcohol].

197
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,358
They also do it even if they’re not young.

198
00:32:38,421 --> 00:32:44,496
It’s like it makes them drop [dead].

199
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:50,177
That’s how I compare it, like it makes from drop [dead].

200
00:32:50,196 --> 00:33:00,671
You know when we scatter things, they drop, and what we call a salt shaker scatters [salt].

201
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:14,390
It truly seems that, when I think about it, what they abuse makes them drop [dead] like that.

202
00:33:14,402 --> 00:33:20,002
Those people didn’t know of any [misfortune] when there was none of that.

203
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:52,309
Now, they have floatation devices that keep a person afloat.

204
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:57,334
One shouldn’t be without those.

205
00:33:57,847 --> 00:34:03,097
And they’re easy to bring along since they’re not heavy.

206
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:12,329
In the summer, people always travel in the summer now.

207
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:18,554
Back then, however, there were none of those for when people fall into water.

208
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:24,867
And they wouldn’t travel by boat, but row kayaks.

209
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:29,061
They used that kayak to travel.

210
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:38,830
Now, however, they have boats, boat motors. They travel with ease.

211
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:48,524
That’s why people need to keep those floatation devices.

212
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:59,468
Now, we know, we found out that a person’s [potential for] misfortune is right in front of him.

213
00:34:59,593 --> 00:35:14,343
Now, you know that after a pesron is happy and laughs, then when he leaves his peers, he’s gone.

214
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:24,200
You see, a person’s [potential for] misfortune is right there. It’s right in front of him.

215
00:35:24,757 --> 00:35:39,407
That’s why these instructions, these Western things, should not be disregarded.

216
00:35:39,414 --> 00:35:48,401
That’s why they should keep those floatation devices with them, and they’re not heavy.

217
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:28,001
Because our elders are going, beacuse no one is speaking about that traditional wisdom from our elders, no one is talking about them anymore.

218
00:36:29,895 --> 00:36:36,195
Some people probably also know them.

219
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:43,389
He probably hears that ancient traditional wisdom.

220
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:49,933
It’s because no one speaks about them anymore.

221
00:36:50,071 --> 00:37:04,134
You see, the people I was born in time to see didn’t change the instruction they were given.

222
00:37:04,146 --> 00:37:09,821
They spoek of one thing as one and the same.

223
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:20,415
When one spoke, he spoke of it. Before long, when another spoke, he spoke of it [in the same way].

224
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:30,778
Because they have no more elders to speak to them

225
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:36,241
They don’t speak of this traditional wisdom anymore

226
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:42,335
Because there’s no more of those who used to speak of them.

227
00:38:05,435 --> 00:38:10,198
But we would also be instructed.

228
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:14,510
And our father would instruct us like this:

229
00:38:14,517 --> 00:38:24,167
He said to clean the debris in the house. He said to clean everything, the floors.

230
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:29,536
And though feel gross, to dump them.

231
00:38:29,543 --> 00:38:34,868
He also told us to think as we dumped them

232
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:42,499
That we want to be good at hunting and gathering, or that we want to live long, or that we want to live well without sickness.

233
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:51,037
Or, he also said to carry the debris in our front hems and take them out, like this.

234
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:56,818
He said to take them out, putting them in the front hem here.

235
00:38:57,081 --> 00:39:04,019
Look, he said, the people back then who wanted light

236
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:13,894
Those people who wanted to have light would always clean up, the ones he said wanted to be pure.

237
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:26,426
He same some who always do that would never get sick. He also said those people never got sick.

238
00:39:28,195 --> 00:39:41,408
And with their hems, he said that though they weren’t baptized, they would emit light from their hems, and the tips of their sleeves, and here from their neck openings.

239
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:49,708
They emit light like this. And though they walk outside, it’s not dark for them.

240
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,583
That’s what he used to tell us.

241
00:39:52,596 --> 00:39:59,821
And though they weren’t baptized, they knew that.

242
00:39:59,827 --> 00:40:08,440
Then he said that we should not be squeamish over those who are sick and clean them up though we get dirty.

243
00:40:08,452 --> 00:40:18,827
He said that impurities do not affect people. He said that a person who serves others does not become impure.

244
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:48,833
These days, our houses are excessive.

245
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:55,089
We’re rich right now. We have everything in the house.

246
00:40:55,246 --> 00:41:01,971
We have everything, like we’re Caucasian, yet we’re Yup’ik.

247
00:41:02,452 --> 00:41:18,115
Then me, with Johnny Samson having a trading post in Nunapitchuk, I mostly stayed there with Cakayak and family as a girl.

248
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:25,652
His wife, you see, didn’t do much. You know, it seemed like she was being careful.

249
00:41:25,671 --> 00:41:34,946
You see, I would wash dishes. And I didn’t menstruate [until] maybe ten years old, or nine back then.

250
00:41:36,165 --> 00:41:42,140
And I would wipe things down since his wife told me to.

251
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:45,709
Apparently, it’s because they were Caucasian.

252
00:41:45,715 --> 00:41:50,753
Half breed, because her husband was half. I’m not sure what his wife was.

253
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:52,778
That’s how I grew up.

254
00:41:52,791 --> 00:42:00,554
And when I went home, because I didn’t stay there all the time, when I went home to my family

255
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:05,466
I would do at home what I did at the Caucasians’.

256
00:42:05,485 --> 00:42:11,610
I would work on these things, and I’d apparently dust things out.

257
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:15,179
You see, I would thoroughly [clean] things.

258
00:42:15,191 --> 00:42:18,429
I learned from them.

259
00:42:18,442 --> 00:42:27,329
These days, there are high schools, colleges.

260
00:42:27,342 --> 00:42:38,704
I think, "These people know so much, including how to clean up the inside of a house."

261
00:42:39,205 --> 00:42:48,392
That’s what I think. Because of what I was like when I stayed with Caucasians for a while, I learned that.

262
00:42:49,317 --> 00:43:01,955
Then during that time, an old woman there in Nunapitchuk, she hadn’t been a very old woman during that time.

263
00:43:01,968 --> 00:43:03,830
I used to visit her.

264
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:08,993
I would go in, and that woman would be washing her things.

265
00:43:09,012 --> 00:43:14,287
And she would wipe her kettles like this on top of her stove.

266
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:22,968
Then when I went in, since that woman had burnt sugar candy, you know how people make burnt sugar candy?

267
00:43:22,987 --> 00:43:26,724
It seemed there was no candy back then to me.

268
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:32,249
That woman would give me burnt sugar candy, and I’d put it in my mouth.

269
00:43:32,262 --> 00:43:36,175
It tasted good like sugar.

270
00:43:36,187 --> 00:43:39,725
I liked to go see that woman for that reason.

271
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,625
Sometimes, that woman would say to me, "Cousin," because I was her cousin

272
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:56,931
Cousin, when you’re on your own like me, when you get married, do what I do. Watch, you’ll have things [to use and eat].

273
00:43:57,588 --> 00:44:06,063
"If you don’t wash things in your home," I was a little girl, "if you leave them alone

274
00:44:06,082 --> 00:44:15,069
"Watch, dust will cover them until eventually you don’t keep it since it got bad, and you throw it away."

275
00:44:15,082 --> 00:44:20,894
And it may be new, but dust makes it very dirty.

276
00:44:20,907 --> 00:44:27,432
Then it becomes undesirable and not good to keep. That’s what she used to tell me.

277
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:50,363
Then these days, they also say this:

278
00:44:50,495 --> 00:44:59,232
"A woman with female children, watch, that woman will watch her mother in the house.

279
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:07,345
"Then what she does, that woman’s child can copy what she does."

280
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,202
These are true.

281
00:45:11,302 --> 00:45:17,202
And now, I have nine children, five girls, four boys.

282
00:45:17,446 --> 00:45:26,221
And these five girls are all different. You know, they’re different.

283
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:33,352
And I love all of them.

284
00:45:33,578 --> 00:45:44,753
Then when I started working, and I started sewing, and my daughters here grew up and started living on their own

285
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:49,334
I would always make them things, and sew for them.

286
00:45:49,728 --> 00:45:58,353
I sometimes go in their houses and see what I sewed on the floor. My mind would be hurt.

287
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:04,634
It turned out that what they were supposed to keep well was on the floor.

288
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,915
I would go into one of my daughter’s [houses], [and it’s] neat.

289
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:14,359
Oh my, and the ones I made would be treated with love.

290
00:46:14,616 --> 00:46:24,966
Then when I did that, among my children, five girls, two of them, I won’t mention their names

291
00:46:25,385 --> 00:46:28,885
From what I’ve seen, [they’re] neat.

292
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:32,529
As they say in English, neat.

293
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:37,986
They’re good. Actually, all of them are good.

294
00:46:38,098 --> 00:46:47,373
Then I realized this: those two would take good care of what I sewed, the clothes I made.

295
00:46:47,379 --> 00:46:56,317
The other one especially takes good care of them, since we see them when I go in her house.

296
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:05,342
In the summer, what I made by sewing, parkas, skin boots, furs, fur clothes

297
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:13,343
I never see them in her house in the summer, nothing. She put[s] them away.

298
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,768
You know, she puts them away.

299
00:47:16,781 --> 00:47:25,968
In Caucaisian homes, I know that fur [clothes] have places, appropriate [storing] spaces.

300
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:30,931
It’s not hot, not cold, maybe medium.

301
00:47:30,938 --> 00:47:33,550
Then their fur is good.

302
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:44,401
You see, when things made of skin hang for years and years, they [?come apart] and can’t be worn anymore.

303
00:47:45,158 --> 00:47:49,495
Then when I take this parka, it rips. It [?comes apart].

304
00:48:16,845 --> 00:48:27,795
These days, it’s worse because people are too rich, since things are God’s gifts.

305
00:48:27,802 --> 00:48:31,689
THings in the home are God’s gifts.

306
00:48:31,702 --> 00:48:37,827
A woman must take good care of them.

307
00:48:37,846 --> 00:48:42,833
Some men do that, you see.

308
00:48:42,846 --> 00:48:45,996
Now, I have different sons-in-law.

309
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:50,840
Some of their husbands like to help his wife.

310
00:48:51,047 --> 00:48:55,209
Some of my children are like that.

311
00:48:55,222 --> 00:48:59,710
And some of their husbands is sedentary.

312
00:48:59,723 --> 00:49:08,235
The woman is hot as she works alone, and the man doesn’t help because he’s a man.

313
00:49:08,248 --> 00:49:16,986
Because men are supposed to work out there, outside work, and women in the house, inside work.

314
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:23,586
But because people are different, my daughters have different spouses.

315
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:31,986
I really like some of their wives. Their spouses take care of their spouses.

316
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:34,630
Oh my, that’s really good.

317
00:49:34,643 --> 00:49:36,730
We tell them.

318
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,318
They are dear.

319
00:49:39,606 --> 00:49:45,506
Those who are sedentary like this, how should I say it?

320
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,513
These days, they say, "weird."

321
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:52,875
I don’t understand this word, "weird."

322
00:49:52,882 --> 00:49:56,594
And it seems one who’s sedintary like that is weird.

323
00:49:58,757 --> 00:50:06,907
You see, when I speak, I add in some funny things.

324
00:50:06,914 --> 00:50:12,489
This is especially what I want to talk about.

325
00:50:12,508 --> 00:50:17,683
These teenagers these days

326
00:50:21,064 --> 00:50:27,927
I [am] sorry for them because they don’t do much.

327
00:50:28,464 --> 00:50:36,989
And their mother would do chores, while the daughter here lays down and reads.

328
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:42,020
It’s probably because they’re skilled with books.

329
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:48,383
And some [do] what they call video [games], ding ding ding ding ding ding.

330
00:50:49,527 --> 00:50:55,202
He sits for how many, couple hours

331
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:01,608
During the time to work, standing up and helping their mother or father.

332
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:12,408
I am speaking of these, also because they are acquainted with God.

333
00:51:12,415 --> 00:51:21,702
It turns out, we must take good care of God’s gifts in the house.

334
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:55,152
Since people back then used to say this, I remember them:

335
00:51:55,165 --> 00:52:03,015
They said that for women, our children, for those of us who are mothers, can copy what we do.

336
00:52:03,134 --> 00:52:05,009
It’s true.

337
00:52:05,065 --> 00:52:14,878
If I always sew, my daughters can copy me, and start sewing.

338
00:52:14,903 --> 00:52:19,753
But these days, this school is too much [of an obstacle].

339
00:52:21,197 --> 00:52:28,685
I will not praise my children. I can use them as examples.

340
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:37,623
Now, I have one child who goes to college. It’s been many years now.

341
00:52:37,635 --> 00:52:41,010
[S]he drops out, as they call it.

342
00:52:41,754 --> 00:52:46,304
What’s going on with these people?

343
00:52:46,861 --> 00:52:57,998
And, you see, [s]he doesn’t know how to live here and work.

344
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:03,748
And [s]he doesn’t want to work, only read.

345
00:53:05,023 --> 00:53:10,098
And using another as an example, it’s okay to use them as examples.

346
00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:16,054
One of my children would be disinclined to go to school.

347
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:24,342
He loves to work. The boy loves to work, outside work.

348
00:53:25,448 --> 00:53:33,573
I know he liked to pack ice when he was small, never letting me be without water.

349
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:35,617
He was very hard-working.

350
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:42,717
I would have him do this, you know, because he was my only provider.

351
00:53:42,892 --> 00:53:53,767
I see him these days, being very knowledgeable about how to work outside.

352
00:53:54,011 --> 00:54:03,273
From the beginning, not waiting until he becomes an old man, but one who is active from the beginning

353
00:54:03,899 --> 00:54:07,986
As they say in English, he will train himself.

354
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:13,149
I can also provide an example of that through one of my children.

355
00:54:13,156 --> 00:54:20,518
These days, the youngest, the youngest of my many children

356
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:26,719
I depend on them for outside chores.

357
00:54:26,857 --> 00:54:32,632
They work like an adult, very knowledgeable.

358
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:40,463
I am speaking about these, using them as examples.

359
00:54:41,107 --> 00:54:46,932
We can learn things by what we see with our eyes.

360
00:54:47,313 --> 00:54:58,263
You know, my mother wouldn’t clean up, but she was always sewing

361
00:54:58,282 --> 00:55:01,420
Because there was nothing to clean up in our house.

362
00:55:01,433 --> 00:55:07,633
But I just said that with Cakayak and his spouse, they’d [?] since they were Caucasian.

363
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,690
But it wasn’t like here; there were no phones.

364
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:14,309
Did they have TV’s?

365
00:55:15,753 --> 00:55:21,078
I can speak of them, what I learned from them.

366
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:55,284
It seemed that I didn’t learn anything when I went to school because I had so little school, because it was too short.

367
00:55:55,484 --> 00:56:03,459
Though I ached to go to school right away, they took husbands at young ages back then.

368
00:56:03,465 --> 00:56:07,740
They had me take a husband, and I was at a young age.

369
00:56:07,759 --> 00:56:11,596
And when we were going to get a marriage license here

370
00:56:11,609 --> 00:56:19,071
That one who gave out marriage licenses was called a commissioner.

371
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:25,034
Somtimes now, I say, "That person who thought himself important lied."

372
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:29,616
I was 16. I think I was 16.

373
00:56:29,635 --> 00:56:35,510
After he said he couldn’t give a marriage license, he wrote on it and gave it.

374
00:56:35,516 --> 00:56:44,116
He falsly wrote that I was 18 and gave us the marriage license, raising my age.

375
00:56:44,873 --> 00:56:49,935
Now, I go by that, how my age was raised.

376
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:53,223
I’m certainly younger than that.

377
00:56:53,228 --> 00:57:03,153
But since they could, you know, prove it with that marriage license, they fixed my documents when my spouse passed away.

378
00:57:03,384 --> 00:57:06,797
I speak of that.

379
00:57:07,234 --> 00:57:13,259
Those people raised ages back then.

380
00:57:13,265 --> 00:57:19,515
These days, they become old women, or a man takes a wife as an old man.

381
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:24,309
Or a woman takes a husband as an old woman these days.

382
00:57:24,978 --> 00:57:31,428
Did our ancestors back then consider it important for a child to get married?

383
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:39,622
Probably because my parents thought it was important, they would also have others encourage me.

384
00:57:39,628 --> 00:57:52,266
You see, back then they would choose their [children’s] spouses by examines their potential spouses characters, and how much they work.

385
00:57:52,279 --> 00:57:57,104
You know, they wouldn’t choose a dumb man.

386
00:57:59,098 --> 00:58:02,810
These days, I should call it, tamian [dumb man].

387
00:58:02,823 --> 00:58:08,998
Some take a husband, and their husband doesn’t know how to do anything.

388
00:58:09,004 --> 00:58:12,467
I’m not lying. Am I lying?

389
00:58:12,604 --> 00:58:15,417
Or a man takes a wife...

390
00:58:16,229 --> 00:58:18,004
There you have it.

391
00:58:18,023 --> 00:58:24,448
I will not keep myself from speaking about these truths.

392
00:58:25,042 --> 00:58:35,767
My parents chose a husband for me, and it turned out that my groom to be was a young man who was extremely knowledgeable about how to do things.

393
00:58:35,786 --> 00:58:38,398
Nick, Nick O’Nick.

394
00:58:38,774 --> 00:58:42,536
And the one I married was apparently very young.

395
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:50,699
Our ages were on the marriage licesnse, Nick was 22, and I was 18 when we married.

396
00:58:51,268 --> 00:59:01,193
My mother used to tell me this: I should not be lazy as I work with him. He is our provider.

397
00:59:01,399 --> 00:59:04,774
She said my husband will provide for us.

398
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:10,318
My older brother was incapacitated by TB and couldn’t do anything.

399
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:15,706
Because I would also worry about my older brother

400
00:59:15,725 --> 00:59:21,037
And if he dies, you see, we used to think of the future.

401
00:59:21,038 --> 00:59:25,588
Though I was young in age, I used to think of the future.

402
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:34,395
Then I would think this: "My husband’s wife, ’Step up,’" because she encouraged me.

403
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:44,283
Then I started thinking like this: I will not, because I loved another.

404
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:53,583
These days, I will say that I loved another.

405
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:58,820
That other one was charming, and I loved him, you see

406
00:59:58,827 --> 01:00:04,377
But without having dated my groom to be, I was withdrawn around him.

407
01:00:04,784 --> 01:00:13,709
Then at that time, my mother also used to tell me, "He’ll be our provider. Look, our provider can’t do anything."

408
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:21,790
Sometimes, you see... they also used to tell us this: we should sit and ponder for a while.

409
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:23,897
I used to do that.

410
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:27,485
Sometimes, you see, I would think like this:

411
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:35,841
"If my brother over there dies who used to provide for me, I will regret it."

412
01:00:58,598 --> 01:01:04,085
I knew about being worried at 16, as a little girl.

413
01:01:04,098 --> 01:01:06,498
I would visit others.

414
01:01:06,505 --> 01:01:08,830
You see, I would think like that.

415
01:01:08,849 --> 01:01:11,911
Then one day, I agreed.

416
01:01:13,099 --> 01:01:18,824
Oh my, it turned out that when married him, I was withdrawn around my spouse.

417
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:24,168
I would go to bed by him fully clothed like this.

418
01:01:24,499 --> 01:01:30,312
You know, they undress, put on gowns or something, and go to bed now.

419
01:01:30,324 --> 01:01:35,737
I would go to bed fully clothed by my spouse.

420
01:01:35,749 --> 01:01:43,687
You see, at that time, I would be with my family downriver since they were downriver and my spouse was upriver.

421
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,625
The village upriver, you know how they split inland.

422
01:01:47,631 --> 01:01:53,619
When I went downriver to my family, I wouldn’t want to go back, you know, not want to go home.

423
01:01:53,632 --> 01:01:57,094
My mother would start telling me, "Go home already."

424
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:04,907
I would go out when I got tired, and my mental state would be smashed as they say in English.

425
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,882
Pity me, I would go upriver to my husband’s.

426
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:20,095
I would start to go in and it would be dead silent. I’d go in and he’d already have gone to bad. I acted so improperly. I had so little proper conduct.

427
01:02:20,327 --> 01:02:25,064
Then since I knew that my spouse was laying here

428
01:02:25,077 --> 01:02:28,266
I’d lay next to him fully clothed.
