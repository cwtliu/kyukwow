1
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:45,190
Yes, okay Betty, you were a health aide long ago in Akiak.

2
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,370
You were part of the first health aides.

3
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,140
Please tell us what your work was like back then.

4
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:04,910
Now, I will tell the story of when it started, starting from when I began, even if it’s not complete.

5
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:08,745
I first started like this:

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:17,610
Back then, when the doctor would arrive, and the nurse would arrive

7
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:28,260
Since they chose me to speak for them, I’d start by speaking for them.

8
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:35,625
I started, and I was knowledgeable.

9
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:41,985
And when I didn’t understand what they said when I was going to pass on their words to a person.

10
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:50,040
I asked them about the meaning when I didn’t understand the doctor or the nurse.

11
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,890
When I understood its meaning a little in Yup’ik, I would pass it on to a person.

12
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:11,550
And when they gave them medicine, they would right them down, indicating them on their labels, and give it to that person.

13
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,830
That’s how I started.

14
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:27,940
And when the doctors or nurses planned to arrive

15
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,990
They started letting me know.

16
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:34,475
Because I wasn't knowledgeable

17
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,850
I wouldn’t follow my disinclination too much.

18
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:47,335
But I would always try to help them with my speech.

19
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:56,770
Then one day, I went to the teachers.

20
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:59,625
When a person came to get me

21
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:09,935
After putting their name, I’d write down what they say their problem was as best as I could

22
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:17,615
And how many days it started since some don’t say it right away.

23
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:25,945
I also didn’t know how to give them medicine by myself.

24
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:35,315
About those things I talked about, I’d wait for the teacher’s lunch.

25
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:42,335
When they had lunch, I’d bring that writing over, and give it to the teacher.

26
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,140
He would put me on the phone. After I read them, he’d go with me.

27
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,740
The only phones would be in the school at that time.

28
00:03:52,745 --> 00:04:02,775
Those first very tall ones upriver when they were BIA schools.

29
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:07,975
The teacher would report to the doctor.

30
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:19,875
Then when the doctor spoke to that person over the phone, he would write them down since I would watch them.

31
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:26,265
The teacher would write what he said, including those medicine.

32
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:29,215
And if he doesn’t get better

33
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:41,260
If the medicine he took didn’t help him, they’d say to bring him to the hospital here. I wrote these down.

34
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,190
Since they would obey me, I wasn’t intimidated by the teachers anymore

35
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,750
Though it was clear I was taking up their time.

36
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:59,210
Then when he stopped speaking, that teacher brought me to the clinic.

37
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:06,045
He would instruct me on what that person should do.

38
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:08,495
I would do that with them.

39
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:14,750
Then in 1960

40
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,260
What I talked about was before 1960.

41
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:30,600
In 1960, the [tribal] council took me, meeting in December with me.

42
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,270
Then at that time

43
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:45,330
They said that they’ve taken me, and to help those that arrive like this.

44
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,770
Since I had no choice, I said I would do it if I were able.

45
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:58,800
And since 1960, it was like what was before had passed.

46
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:04,545
I didn’t quit in 1960, but I went to the teachers.

47
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:15,960
Then one day, that teacher, they would be replaced, replaced.

48
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:23,000
I went to one of them, whose name I haven’t forgotten.

49
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:28,055
But I won’t say their name. I know it clearly.

50
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:32,825
I went to them. I’d go to them in the past.

51
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,810
This one wasn’t like the others before them.

52
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,540
After going to them several times, they told me

53
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:52,860
[S]he said this to me: [s]he didn’t come to Kwethluk to be a nurse or a doctor.

54
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:57,245
[S]he said [s]he came to teach.

55
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,480
Then I said to them

56
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:12,735
"Since I do not know much about the English language, I also need you teachers’ help since way before you."

57
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:20,195
Then [s]he said that [s]he reads what I write.

58
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,320
[S]he said that there was nothing confusing.

59
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:32,165
[S]he said that I should report by myself, briefing them over there.

60
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:35,685
[S]he said that I should report on the radio by myself.

61
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:50,588
Then I said to them, "Hey you, since I was born, I have come from all the days before me to this day.

62
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:57,751
"Never once have I pressed the radio’s button."

63
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:08,874
"No, I will teach you. I will teach you if you come with me inland."

64
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:11,523
I said, "If you want to."

65
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:16,682
I took them out of their house, and we went inland since it was lunch time.

66
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:28,927
Then when we went in, when they used to do this, you know, with no clocks, we waited for the doctor to be open.

67
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:37,371
When they heard the first one speaking, I think they would then answer.

68
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:46,633
Then this teacher said to me, "Watch me. I will watch you and have you speak."

69
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:48,622
I agreed.

70
00:08:51,223 --> 00:09:01,267
Then after making the call, [s]he called them.

71
00:09:02,571 --> 00:09:07,915
Then [s]he said to them that it was my report.

72
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:15,050
Then, oh my, I didn’t learn right away from watching them.

73
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:23,757
But what they said, I didn’t know what they pressed.

74
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:31,175
When [s]he was finished, [s]he said to me

75
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:40,677
And after [s]he put the instructions for the medicine, when [s]he spoke to the doctor

76
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:44,766
[S]he said [s]he was going to have me repeat what [s]he said.

77
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:51,101
The doctor was fine with it. [S]he told them to do it. [S]he agreed.

78
00:09:52,790 --> 00:10:00,257
Then when [s]he brought it to me

79
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:11,917
Since it was still going and [s]he gave it to me, [s]he said to me, "Now, talk about that," then that [s]he would listen to me.

80
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:15,031
[S]he was in front of me.

81
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:21,899
Then I said I heard what [s]he said.

82
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:29,840
And I said I heard what the patient needs to do, and their medicine.

83
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:32,525
"Did I hear you right?"

84
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:44,117
You know, I couldn’t say "over" either. I didn’t know how to say "over" at that time when they used to say "over."

85
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:53,385
Oh my, [s]he said it’s good. [S]he said it’s good. [S]he said I understood it well.

86
00:10:55,059 --> 00:11:05,267
Then when I was done with it, that teacher said to me

87
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:14,479
[S]he said that from then on, I would call by myself.

88
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:22,122
I said, "I won’t call by myself tomorrow. You’ll go with me." [S]he said [s]he’d go with me.

89
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:32,416
Then when it was lunch time, I went to the, bringing with me that patient’s things

90
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:39,905
Because when they got me, I’d write them down as best as I could.

91
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:47,261
Then when I went to them, [s]he said to me, "Are you going to make the call?"

92
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,698
I said yes.

93
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,350
[S]he said that I should...

94
00:11:54,407 --> 00:12:03,717
After the previous day, [s]he said that I should go inland and call the doctor.

95
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:09,414
I said to them, "Come with me. I didn’t learn what to press."

96
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:15,133
[S]he said it’s on there. You know, it’s there in big letters down there.

97
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:19,484
Then we went inland together.

98
00:12:19,586 --> 00:12:27,820
Then [s]he said to me when we went in to press these and read these.

99
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:33,844
[S]he said to indicate Kwethluk since it’s put there.

100
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:38,397
Reading those, I looked at and read those here.

101
00:12:39,753 --> 00:12:45,664
It wasn’t long. Though it was sudden, [s]he answered me without scolding too much.

102
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:48,361
I told them about that.

103
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:57,692
After telling them, after saying what [s]he said

104
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:05,220
[S]he said that they should take that medicine.

105
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:11,354
I also wrote them down though that teacher was watching me.

106
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:15,013
When I was done, I was done.

107
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:27,070
[S]he told me to look at the medicine by myself over there and set them out.

108
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:34,514
[S]he said that [s]he would look at them that evening. [S]he was at their house, at the doctor’s house.

109
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:39,648
However, the phone was inland at the school.

110
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:45,613
You see, it’s distressing when one doesn’t know like this.

111
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:52,231
It’s, you know, scary for people. It’s scary for people.

112
00:13:52,243 --> 00:14:02,588
But since it’s like it takes getting used to, it seemed that it became more [?manageable].

113
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:10,020
And what used to make the heart pound doesn’t make it pound anymore.

114
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:13,094
It isn’t bothered anymore.

115
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:23,843
Then after [s]he went with me several times, [s]he gave me keys.

116
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:33,005
[S]he gave me keys for [the school] up there, and the clinic’s keys.

117
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:42,732
Even if I didn’t go to them when the school is locked, [s]he told me to open it, go in, and use the communication device.

118
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:52,776
Also, when they said to prepare medicine, [s]he told me to go down, open it without notifying anyone, and prepare the medicine.

119
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:58,076
I started doing that before I went to training.

120
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:07,261
Then just when I started doing that, I got into training.

121
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:23,140
When I started training, I would try to do what I had done like that.

122
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:30,205
But we became two as we were going back when we were going to train.

123
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:32,964
There were two of us like this.

124
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:43,364
But when the two of us started working, we would eat [lunch].

125
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,867
We wouldn’t have lunch.

126
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:58,462
It would open at 10:00, until when would it go? I think it would be until 5:00 back when we started.

127
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:06,989
We wouldn’t have lunch because the teacher sent students to us

128
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,671
All the way until it closed.

129
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:17,801
And after closing, when people came to get us, we would go there.

130
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:20,636
We would go there.

131
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:30,397
And when they came in at night while we were sleeping and woke us up, and I wasn’t the only one.

132
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:35,747
When they came to get us, we’d go to that person[’s house].

133
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:49,573
And after I trained then, it truly seemed that I was not reserved to even give them medicine [since] it they became clear.

134
00:16:49,581 --> 00:17:03,270
But I would give out what I didn’t fully understand, including the names I didn’t fully understand.

135
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:08,273
I wouldn’t give them to a person without explaining them.

136
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:12,930
This is it for that [story].

137
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:17,095
There is a lot before what I just said.

138
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:23,502
Starting from what I first started to my training, I’ve spoken about this.

139
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:32,913
You just said that when you first started, that you did it without any training.

140
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:40,065
How does this pertain to instructions on how to make your own living

141
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:44,372
It’s in their traditional instructions, that a person must make their own living.

142
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:51,944
What can you instruct to us young poeple about how to work to make your own living like that?

143
00:17:52,616 --> 00:18:00,160
You see, I told you this: "I didn’t choose to work hard with them on my own

144
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:13,405
"But I passed the doctor’s and nurse’s message, passed it on in my hard work that wasn’t my choice."

145
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:23,879
That’s what I did. I started back then without knowing how to take are of medicine.

146
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:34,027
But when I  went to training, I would do it according to what I had learned.

147
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:44,947
So, how did you learn to to speak English, or how did you learn to how understand English back before teachers came?

148
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,403
Did you go to school before then?

149
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:52,235
I went to school before that.

150
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:57,342
But back when I first learned writing

151
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:06,116
But when I became an adult, I think it was when I learned after becoming aware.

152
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,026
I don’t know what year.

153
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:17,596
I can’t say what it was to this day, yet I went to school when it was in a building.

154
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:21,536
It wasn’t a school, but in a house.

155
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:27,890
We started going to school from then, and they eventually built a school.

156
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:36,280
Then when they made schools, in our school, I stopped at the fifth grade.

157
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:41,598
Those was my education until the fifth grade.

158
00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:50,205
Back when you first started learning, were you not asked to speak, or to speak in Yup’ik?

159
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:54,455
Oh my, they told us not to speak [Yup’ik]

160
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:59,280
Since we didn’t know English, we didn’t listen to them.

161
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:05,150
So did you start speaking English?

162
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:13,631
And as we went, when we started [speaking amongst] ourselves, and we started understand when the teacher spoke to us.

163
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:18,492
And we also started speaking to them.

164
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:23,306
Others, even the Catholics up on the Yukon, say this now

165
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:31,070
Back when they first went to school, they said they’d be punished when speaking Yup’ik.

166
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,513
What did they do to you?

167
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:40,572
They wouldn’t punish us even if we spoke Yup’ik to each other.

168
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:53,356
But you are speaking English as you go to school. You, all the school boys and girls, speak English, not Eskimo language.

169
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:56,800
Since it’s our language.

170
00:20:56,807 --> 00:21:03,215
I still remember what that teacher said to this day.

171
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,088
Okay, thank you for telling us the stories.

172
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:07,644
You’re welcome.

173
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,917
They’re also related to [?] in Napaskiak downriver.

174
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:17,354
Paul Guy, the Guy family downriver in Napaskiak are my grandchildren.

175
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,780
But his father is my child.

176
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:24,122
And Andrew Guy is your grandchild?

177
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,989
Yes, he’s my grandchild.

178
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,164
I do know him.

179
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,285
I see.

180
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:33,022
And recently... so, you have eleven grandchildren.

181
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:34,351
Yes.

182
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:41,414
Phillip Guy’s children, and his older brother’s childre like this

183
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:49,304
There were 12. They both have six children each.

184
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:54,909
But one of the children of the older brother passed away last year.

185
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:57,514
Have you not gotten any great-grandchildren yet?

186
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:00,968
I did get great-grandchildren.

187
00:22:01,326 --> 00:22:06,035
I have great-grandchildren. How many great-grandchildren do I have again?

188
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:10,208
You see, Kiarrngualuk

189
00:22:14,154 --> 00:22:18,587
Then the younger one...
