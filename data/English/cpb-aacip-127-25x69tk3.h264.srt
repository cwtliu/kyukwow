1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,270
With houses, we want them to take advantage of that good weather.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,790
Down there, I also tell those young people down there.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,570
Some of them, I’m not sure what they make of me.

4
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:19,275
Some of them listen until I am completely finished.

5
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:25,805
The boys and the girls listen extremely well.

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:36,710
And those poor people out there, I tell them about what I have just said.

7
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:42,545
I do talk to them about how they should be.

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:49,290
Because though wouldn’t do anything or talk back, the poor things listen to me.

9
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:55,250
One of them also took me around here yesterday

10
00:00:56,025 --> 00:01:01,855
He stays at the house of someone who’s about to give birth.

11
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:06,435
He says he stays at their house.

12
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:23,420
Look, those struggling people that I was born in time to see, I never saw anyone else like them after.

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,180
See, it’s been a long time since I became aware.

14
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:44,965
You see, I am now 93 years old.

15
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:57,056
If I make it safely to May, I will turn 94.

16
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:04,550
My age past 90.

17
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:16,819
It’s unfortunate now. I really wish to be strong for you, especially you young people.

18
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:21,126
I wish that I could be strong for what I just said.

19
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:32,445
I want you to become good people, and do not disregard the wisdom passed to you. Become obedient people and see.

20
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:45,058
You, see if you become obedient people, you will become good people, if you become people who follow the wisdom passed to you.

21
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:48,446
You will become good people.

22
00:02:49,514 --> 00:03:02,764
You see, even though one is not always obedient like this, being obedient and faithful leads to a good life.

23
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:07,183
Now, you see, in your poor state,

24
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:13,621
And before I saw anyone who wronged me, I’ve become like this.

25
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,309
Here I am.

26
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:22,566
Before anyone said harmful words to me, I’ve become like this.

27
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:31,073
I treated everything the same through having you watch me.

28
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:38,754
It’s good to treat everyone the same without thinking them of them as children, and encouraging them.

29
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:49,198
You see, only a person who is like that will go through life well.

30
00:03:49,680 --> 00:04:04,205
And like that, he will not come to anything, or accidents, and he will keep going without coming to being treated badly.

31
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:10,411
Only one who is just, who is obedient.

32
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:20,499
An obedient person who does not disregard traditional wisdom, but applies them, will be like that.

33
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:29,456
My dear husband and I were married without being abusive.

34
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:42,256
He did break my heart, but I didn’t, you know, do the same to him.

35
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:48,244
It had turned out that it would be a good thing if he passed before me.

36
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:54,119
It’s a good thing I was like that even though he had broken my heart.

37
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:01,238
It’s a good thing that I wasn’t like that even though he had broken my heart.

38
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:06,226
I still think that’s a good thing to this day.

39
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:09,313
See, here’s another thing:

40
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:26,232
The first here, when I hear about people putting down others and treated them badly,

41
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:35,401
You see, that first one is not untrue, it’s definitely not untrue.

42
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:46,307
You see, I remember what Jesus said when I hear about people doing this, when he said this:

43
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:57,533
He said that he did not come to destroy this commandment, but to fulfill it.

44
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:09,902
You see? See that the one with the authority to destroy it, did not destroy even a little of the first customs and commandment.

45
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:13,939
It was not destroyed in the least.

46
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,489
I think of it now very clearly.

47
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:25,533
Well, is it time for me to stop, cousin?

48
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:27,278
It’s time for you to stop.

49
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:31,665
Okay, please stay now that it’s time to end.

50
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:43,903
Please stay. Let me tell these young people about the traditional wisdom that I know and think of, okay?

51
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,603
Okay.

52
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:52,978
Okay now. Understand this truth:

53
00:06:53,278 --> 00:07:02,478
If we intentionally sin, our sins will have no more chances of forgiveness,

54
00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:10,609
But in our future there is a great trial,

55
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:25,648
And a frightening fire for the destruction of the sinners, Hebrews 10:26.

56
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:28,467
Now it’s done.

57
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:31,136
Yes, thank you. (It’s done.)

58
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,592
That’s all, no.

59
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:41,118
He did not go out for twelve hours.

60
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:50,437
When she walked around the house, she would always walk with a tube attached here.

61
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:52,518
Here's my spouse and I.

62
00:07:52,662 --> 00:08:00,887
But the one who was like that lived for three months without our knowledge.

63
00:08:01,118 --> 00:08:09,056
??It’s been a long time since those who are in our lands fish salmon for money.

64
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:17,643
Through the fish in 1976, here is what they studied here on the Kuskokwim and near the mouth of the Yukon.

65
00:08:19,118 --> 00:08:22,868
These Causcasians do not tell us because we’re Yup’ik.

66
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:27,930
It also says this:

67
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:35,350
It says that what they call mercury, down in the rivers...

68
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:43,758
Matthew, we asked you to speak about this: waste and spills (?)

69
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:47,810
It’ll be fine if you do that later.

70
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:49,630
Our time is running out.

71
00:08:49,702 --> 00:08:50,808
It won’t take long.

72
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:56,536
I first wanted to explain that means, what my work means.

73
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:04,695
I am now alone like a piece of debris on the sand on the shore.

74
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:10,363
When I explain it, people doubt me and try to stop me like this.

75
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:17,739
But if we understood, our people probably would not be like this.

76
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:25,343
They say that because our fish now, since our fish are like this unbeknownst to us

77
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:29,190
When we eat them, especially their livers

78
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:38,190
When a woman eats salmon with those bad things we don’t know about

79
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,858
Our counterparts who do not understand

80
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:47,059
I travel working with people

81
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:52,946
I repeatedly leave my wife despite our children.

82
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,560
That’s the reason I’m bringing it up.

83
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,242
It still hasn’t stopped now.

84
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:04,631
If I get that, it will be like I have gotten something.

85
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:11,855
With the destruction of our salmon without our knowledge through the pollution of those looking for profit

86
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:24,028
They say that because this fetus inside is upside down, it destroys his brain.

87
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:26,563
Yet he is born underdeveloped.

88
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:33,374
And now, I am going to speak so that our survival will improve.

89
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:41,464
Because of that, I started traveling a lot without stopped and rarely sat.

90
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:49,361
But ONC and AVCP paid for my lodging and meals here in the city

91
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:52,941
And I didn’t think of money for myself.

92
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:57,949
It was only so that people here would get better.

93
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:03,818
And then when a child is born like this, he is underdeveloped.

94
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,213
It turns out its inside in his brain.

95
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:12,338
Now, when we admonish these children, they’ve started thinking:

96
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:16,866
"I wonder why he’s admonishing me against that?"

97
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:23,404
We probably don’t explain the origin of that, curious about how that is harmful.

98
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:32,027
When they are curious about it, even alcohol and marijuana, they will wake up with a slight headache and be wide awake that evening.

99
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:38,500
That is what destroys our young people.

100
00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:43,503
But now, it’s as if I am going forward.

101
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:49,637
Because even though I bring it up to our people here in Alaska and to the governement, they don’t listen to me.

102
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:57,588
I went to another place out of state to ask for help from my former fellow teacher.

103
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:00,619
He will take care of us.

104
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:09,641
You’ve probably also seen one of you up there in October and in December

105
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:20,166
Here on KYUK TV, and you’ve seen it in January and the beginning of February

106
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:28,796
They said that they would show that again between 12 and 8 on KYUK.

107
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:31,366
It is important to them.

108
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:37,861
And now, these two dear people are recording me with that in mind.

109
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,766
It will probably show sometime again.

110
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:50,041
In order for our people to go forth well, I am not sitting for this anymore.

111
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:56,586
We have unknowingly allowed it to become like this.

112
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:02,846
Since that is harmful to the mind in different ways

113
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:10,501
Since people live with varying strengths, some of them are strongly affected, and some are not harmed much.

114
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:19,431
I am not speaking of our ancestors right now, but especially what our people, our people, are harmed by

115
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:22,151
To try to help you understand.

116
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:34,171
So that we they will become better in our future, I want to see them go forth better before I am gone from this earth.

117
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:41,166
Now, we are only working to encourage those who have been mentally hurt from the beginning.

118
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:51,391
Many Caucasians do not have any enthusiasm for that, only we Yupiit, because they profit off of us.

119
00:13:51,836 --> 00:14:00,836
You see, they have a lot of workers, social workers, police, interrogators, planes, and health care workers all gathered.

120
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:09,761
They say that now, alcohol is the only one, not other ailments

121
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:18,816
The state has lost over $300 million to those working for the people.

122
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:26,096
They are not enthusiastic because they would lost a lot with their work.

123
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:32,261
Here, you know that they cannoy stop those who sell

124
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:37,916
Since the police down there do not work hard on them since it is a source of income.

125
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:45,116
That’s why, there may be a lot of explanations on this paper

126
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:54,281
Since I am not working here anymore, I am personally not sitting for my young people, our young people.

127
00:14:56,106 --> 00:15:08,526
Maybe if you teach and push your young people toward science

128
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:14,731
If it does not hold meaning for a single Yup’ik, it will get worse.

129
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:22,886
See what the Caucasians have brought forth: they are not readily available to listen to us, only telling us to quit.

130
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,446
They only listen once in a while.

131
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:34,151
From what I see now, they are not getting more peaceful, not getting easier.

132
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:47,576
Becuase of these salmon, those of us here between Akula and the Yukon are the most harmed than our fellow people here in our state.

133
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:55,576
Because our salmon are eating the pollution from those making profit unbeknownst to us

134
00:15:55,716 --> 00:16:08,466
And between us, the animals probably choke on things and eat the salmon among the plants when the main river floods inland then goes out.

135
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:20,176
I do request them for researchers for those, especially how those are taken care of.

136
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:24,911
It I think we will get help from Switzerland.

137
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:34,761
This summer, they will present taking care of the earth in relation to our ailments.

138
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:41,421
It’s going to be two years since they’ve come to Bethel and researched for two weeks

139
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:45,991
Also going inland to nature aroudn us and examining the plants.

140
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:58,391
Do not tire of the sources of our work to improve us going forward, but continue them.

141
00:16:58,606 --> 00:17:04,816
They only listen once in a while, especially our counterparts.

142
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:12,876
Here is what they strive for: our riches down in our pristine lands.

143
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:19,891
That is the main reason that they do not cooperate with us.

144
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:28,606
You who have gone to school also know that they shot arrows and guns at the Native Americans and reduced their populations.

145
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:41,451
Now, they utilize those, the destruction of the nature and land around us, to reduce our population.

146
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,631
And our population isn’t increasing.

147
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:46,506
We also don’t reach a million.

148
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:54,511
You see, I traveled to a place that reached a population of eight million, a single city.

149
00:17:55,006 --> 00:18:02,276
As a Yup’ik, it was as if I were a single piece of sand on the shore.

150
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:05,316
Because I was helpless, I said that first.

151
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:08,781
I have peers who would like to speak. Thank you for listening.

152
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:13,246
Because I wasn’t like this a long time ago

153
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:21,141
Also because I would regret what I said after I speak.

154
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:29,041
It turns out that becoming this age, it gets less difficult to speak.

155
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:33,976
Poor me, I just listened to what I was like.

156
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:44,061
But my teacher back then, because I stayed on the floor on a mattress

157
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:49,351
Before I went out, my teacher would speak to me even if it wasn’t all the time.

158
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:54,541
He would mainly speak to me about how I should live.

159
00:18:55,866 --> 00:19:02,546
But I would listen to what we shouldn’t do and I wouldn’t be able to move.

160
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,631
He would speak to me about how I should live.

161
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:13,381
I just talked about what we shouldn’t do. I used to listen to him.

162
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:23,766
When he spoke, he would say that the people long ago would have no sicknesses.

163
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:36,151
Also, he said that when someone passed away once in a while in faraway villages, if there was a nimble person

164
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:45,786
He said that when that visitor arrived and said that someone from a faraway village had passed away

165
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:52,716
He said that that village would cry and grieve loudly over him.

166
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:57,156
I wonder why he said this? I recognize it now.

167
00:19:57,966 --> 00:20:04,526
He said that later when the world is going to be no more, people will pass away more quickly.

168
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,241
He also said that they would start hurting themselves.

169
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:18,721
He said that they would stop grieving over them, but laugh at them.

170
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:27,026
He said that when the world is close to being no more, we people will become foolish all the same.

171
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:31,641
I used to hear this. It’s probably true now. I recognize it.

172
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:35,276
When I used to hear of the far future, my heart would skip a beat.

173
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:41,966
And I was worse than those doing wrong by abusing alcohol.

174
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:49,171
I heavily abused alcohol, and it would be the only thing in my mind coming from the wilderness

175
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:55,951
I realized that I was destroying my old body of my own volition.

176
00:20:57,651 --> 00:21:03,831
My regret to this day is doing that in front of my children.

177
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:06,256
It turned out that I had taught them.

178
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:10,656
Today, that is my greatest regret.

179
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:17,371
And I cry

180
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:26,191
Becuase I had taught them something bad that would destroy me when I reached this age.

181
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:32,656
It is amazing how true what those people said long ago.

182
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:39,831
He would also especially talk about this:

183
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:46,166
"Never take another person’s possessions, and do not covet him.

184
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:54,696
"Also, if you enter another house, do not take even a single match or nail from that house.

185
00:21:56,716 --> 00:22:04,746
"Or even if you travel in the wilderness, no matter what you see, do not covet and take it."

186
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:09,206
He said that a person never forgets what he puts even in the wilderness.

187
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:20,041
Because I am not fluent in English, what I had to say was about my teacher.

188
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:25,876
Alcohol destroys this body. And today, it’s accompanied by medicine and marijuana...
