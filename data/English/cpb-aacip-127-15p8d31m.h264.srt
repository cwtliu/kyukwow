1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,500
You see, we were like this…

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,000
…some of it from Oscar and the other.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,900
Let me speak about it like this.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I can’t ignore part of the Bible that I learned.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
There is a lot I don’t know.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,800
One of the men confessed to me.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,000
When I was a lay pastor, one of them said in a confession

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That he had a dream the night before.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He didn’t like his dream.

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,000
He said that he saw himself as very fat like this.

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,000
He was strong, tough, and fat.

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:05,000
And then, he said that he saw one of children whom he loved,
the eldest son, after looking at himself.

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,000
He said [his son] was very skinny.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,500
He was pitiful.
And his bones were only covered by skin.

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:26,000
He said that he envied himself because he loved him so much.

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,000
Envying himself,
“Why am I fat? He should be fat.”

17
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,000
Do youpl understand it? Youpl might not understand it.

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,200
And then the one who had the dream understood this:

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:58,000
You know the entire Bible, and you know how
one should be on the earth.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,300
Yet even though you’re like that, you don’t instruct your children

21
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:14,800
They’re skinny because you don’t instruct them.
You are fat in your knowledge.

22
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,000
Well? I digressed with that.
Am I in accordance with what they’re saying?

23
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,500
And then, I don’t know English.
I took Anitia’s place.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,500
How is “promote” translated?

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don’t understand what “promote the heritage” says here.
(To bring it forth.)

26
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,000
Please explain it to me.
(To bring it forth.)

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,500
I’m hard of hearing.
(To bring it forth.)

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,200
To bring forth a way of life, right?

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,300
Okay, let’s [cover] a small part of it.

30
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,500
We, us for me personally

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,500
One of them told me yesterday, it may have been Ayapruca’ar

32
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:15,500
From our time, it seems that starting from us, where a Yup’ik
is going is changing. Right?

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Our descendants here are becoming Westernized.

34
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,500
They’re becoming Westernized, and some
understand Yup’ik anymore.

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,000
They’ve started only speaking completely in English.

36
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:40,400
And then even if we [teach] what a person must be like
living a Yup’ik life

37
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,500
How are we going to teach those who’ve learned English?

38
00:03:48,500 --> 00:04:01,400
Will our dear children be able to enthusiastically begin
[living] our lives where we struggled?

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,500
We would travel with dog teams, and we would gather wood
by pushing sleds in the Akula region.

40
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
We also used to travel without dogs.

41
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,000
Also, our shovels were not convenient,
and our axes were not convenient.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We, yourpl elders

43
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,900
And when I imagine our elders, they probably struggled a lot more.

44
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:40,300
As we became more Westernized and using their tools,
it seems that things have been getting easier.

45
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:50,000
And now, they’ve started reaching far places right away
where we used to strive to reach starting early in the morning.

46
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,000
Well? Do youpl understand this?

47
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,000
I might speak too excessively.

48
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,500
Later… let me tell you this:

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,500
I’m not fluent in English. I’ve received a letter
from here concerning entertainment.

50
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,500
George [?] wrote asking if I wanted to entertain
here at the Elders’ Conference.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Because I didn’t know what it meant,
I thought they would give me one of these to say

52
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,400
“Following our legacies in our future.”

53
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,200
Thinking that I was going to be given one of these to say,
I agreed to the one who asked me.

54
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,000
This is probably what it is.

55
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,500
And now, I understand that it’s a form of fun.

56
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,000
As I’ve been watching those before me
when it comes to this entertainment

57
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
They sing, and even Yup’ik dance.

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,900
I don’t sing. I have a bad voice.

59
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,500
Also, I used to Yup’ik, but I don’t now.

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,400
But if I have to do something funny later at 2:00,
I can make youpl smile.

61
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,000
That’s all from me. It’s enough.

62
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,000
…years have passed.

63
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:36,000
I had started understanding our ancestors’ traditional wisdom
as I’ve gone in life.

64
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,500
Now, they’ve also started referring to the Spirit of the Universe
as [the Christian] God.

65
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,000
This qilak is now also the name of [Heaven] above.

66
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:59,000
…when villages started going the wrong way,
that shaman would steer them the right way.

67
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,800
But because I started being afraid of myself…

68
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It used to be called a water offering a long time ago.

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,500
Also, this way of food or water offerings…

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,500
…we evidently used to offer food or water for the deceased.

71
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,900
That’s what I started to understand.

72
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,500
I’ve ended up talking about them since I’ve held them for so long.

73
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,900
Our belief…

74
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:46,000
…for that reason, [we do that] to our young people.

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,500
We have apparently stopped insetruction them
because we might teach them something bad.

76
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:07,000
Because some of us here have different beliefs,
our traditional custom…

77
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,500
…but since we’ve started holding meetings since last year

78
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Priests who have different beliefs meet and have started understanding
our ancient way of life more and more.

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Including abstinence.

80
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Youpl know me.

81
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:38,000
In my earliest memories of the Kuskokwim here,
the Kuskokwim was our main river.

82
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,000
Alciq is my Yup’ik name.

83
00:08:42,500 --> 00:09:02,000
And then from what I know, I talked yesterday about
using it for support.

84
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We people of the land have this extremely ancient instruction
as our support.

85
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:22,800
And our support should be respected, and should always be respected.

86
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:37,000
For us elders today, that cause for respect is there.

87
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:50,500
That thing we must respect supports the people of the earth.

88
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,000
They also know who supports them.

89
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Because we have always been supported by this ancient thing

90
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,500
And it supports our lives, we dear healthy ones here
are standing.

91
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:27,500
And the way we are towards a person’s name,
we consider his Yup’ik name important.

92
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,400
We also consider the Yup’ik language important
because we are Yupiit.

93
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:45,500
I’m very thankful that we call each other [by our Yup’ik names]
among ourselves.

94
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:53,000
And then, we Yupiit know this:

95
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:05,500
Welcoming each other, and treating each other
the way we should treat each other well.

96
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:15,800
That’s why this way we are is extremely important among us.

97
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It’s need for respect is always like that,
and it should always be respected.

98
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That’s why for our descendats, the young people here

99
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:46,500
From they education, they learn how to speak English to each other.

100
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,000
And indeed, what they have learned later

101
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:08,200
Does one first learn from what he has been taught
by his parents?

102
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:18,000
And then they learn to be Westernized later.

103
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:26,000
That is also in that young Yup’ik person.

104
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,500
It’s in him since he first learned from his parents.

105
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:40,500
This Westernization is also in him since it was taught to him.

106
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We know this:

107
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:55,000
When a person takes another, he takes him and his hands…

108
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,500
…we [always] exercise as we were taught.

109
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:11,000
When they follow their Yup’ik dancing tradition,
they’re happy, thankful, and they laugh.

110
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There you have it.

111
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,500
Truly, these knowledgable people [must use]
what we are living now

112
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,500
They must work to oppose these Caucasians with what they learned.

113
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,500
They must work for the good [of our people].

114
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:48,000
And truly, it’s exciting and good to work for the good [of our people].

115
00:13:49,500 --> 00:14:04,800
This bringing forth [goodness], even if they didn’t
get it right away a long time ago

116
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But when they know later, all of us people are thankful
when they find out [about this goodness].

117
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:31,000
And now, some of us are preparing good things
that they will use.

118
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,500
And we elders [must do] that

119
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:45,000
And when two, three, or several men are together

120
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:59,500
When we discuss what they are preparing,
it’s like we’re spreading it

121
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,500
Because their work inspires others.

122
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:19,800
And then we must prepare those good things
that we will use so that they will inspire others.

123
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you.

124
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,500
…[some of] these people these days are not like
those in my earliest memories.

125
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
They even have a shorter life span.

126
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Back in my earliest memories, I used to see old women and men

127
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,000
Ones who only walked supporting themselves
with their knees that didn’t stretch out.

128
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yet they had no walking staffs.

129
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,700
How old would they be?

130
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,000
They were certainly over 100 years old.

131
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Several who are over 100 years old that I used to see
are not like those.

132
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,900
Their [legs] can stretch, and they walk with canes.

133
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
They don’t support themselves with their knees when they walk.

134
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,500
I wonder what makes us lack old men these days?

135
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,500
The Bible very clearly tells us this:

136
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:47,000
Because we disobey our parents, mothers, and fathers,
our lives get cut short.

138
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,000
We only do what we think is fun.

139
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:04,500
Our parents and mothers back then talked to us as if they were
scolding us because they wanted us to live long lives.

140
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Turns out, they talked to us like that because they loved us.

141
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:18,500
Let me touch on what I heard about food and water offerings.

142
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
They used to do that a long time ago, and I used to see it.

143
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:31,000
However, my parents would not make food or water offerings
like that because they had already understood.

144
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,500
Food and water offerings were evidently done like this:
they prayed to that person who had died.

145
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:56,000
They prayed for good lives, lives without sickness,
or they prayed to and entreated a dead person

146
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Because they were not instruction on [religious] entreaty.

147
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,500
But when Jesus arrived, he said that he had become the way.

148
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If we entreat through him, he will give us what we want.

149
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,000
That’s what it was like, a form of prayer.

150
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,700
Our ancestors know God as the Spirit of the Universe.

151
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But because Jesus appeared recently,
our ancestors didn’t know him.

152
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,400
They said that when they first heard about Jesus,
they would say in reply

153
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,500
“Why is that person’s life so important?”

154
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,500
It was because they didn’t understand it.

155
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,800
That is how I understand it.

156
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:05,000
And because we’ve stopped doing one thing that makes us
live longer, especially these days.

157
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:19,000
Our ancestors back then, when young women or men wanted to live
long lives, they would watch over their land here.

158
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,000
They didn’t leave garbage in it, and they cleaned up
the areas in settlements.

159
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:32,500
They would dump that garbage in one place
where no one had trod.

160
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,500
That was what our ancestors instructed too.

161
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Cleaning up the land here was [one of] their instructions.

162
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,600
That is the meaning of our ancestors’ long lives back then.

163
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,500
Because God owns this land, he doesn’t want us to
leave it trashed or polluted.

164
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It must be left pristine like our ancesotrs.

165
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,400
And if we’re like that, we have traditional wisdom from our ancestors

166
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,000
They said that if we’re like that, we will live long lives.

167
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,000
Our bodies will also be standing strong.

168
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:28,500
And they said that even if those around us are sick,
that sickness will not affect us if we’re like that.

169
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:40,700
That is God’s gratitude for people keeping his land pristine
that he has lent us.

170
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,400
They say that God’s gratitude toward that person
is having him live a long life.

171
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:59,500
And on top of that, what they call great hunters or those who are good
at catching animals, both men and women.

172
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:09,800
God apparently rewards a person like that
who cleans up this land.

173
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,000
It’s an ancient traditional instruction to this day.

174
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:26,000
And we heard, “Honor your father and mother so that you will
live long in this land that Jehovah your god has given you.”

175
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:35,000
If you are obedient like that, we should not hide this
from our children…
