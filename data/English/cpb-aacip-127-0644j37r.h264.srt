1
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,450
Those round [?], they called them tannin. They were good.

2
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:46,835
Yeah, we’re rolling, so thank you for your patience.

3
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:49,345
We can go ahead and start.

4
00:00:53,065 --> 00:01:01,700
Now, you should talk about what you used to hear way back then.

5
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,850
Okay.

6
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:09,290
In my earliest memories, people weren’t like this with nothing to do.

7
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:17,666
They only ate from the wilderness. They didn’t eat too much Western food.

8
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:25,057
Now, boys are completely sedentary, and ask only of fathers.

9
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:34,981
Since I always had work, I never asked anything of my father, also because I tried to do things on my own.

10
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:41,542
I’d go get wood and had three dogs, and a sled.

11
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:50,299
And with those drift nets that would deteriorate easily that had wooden floats

12
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:53,928
And those old bullets.

13
00:01:53,944 --> 00:02:05,577
I’d always try to set the lead line, thinking of how we might go hungry, go without flour, and I’d have no cigarettes

14
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:13,377
Though [s]he’s admonish me, I’d go, but when [s]he spoke to me, I’d listen.

15
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:27,740
You also just said that you always had job, and that you liked to work. Please talk about your workplace.

16
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,593
When I worked at a cannery, I’d always [?].

17
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:38,012
Then I’d owe my peers as I’d sleep at their places.

18
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:40,506
I liked to work.

19
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:43,367
And they’d always let me come first.

20
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:47,329
Sometimes, I’d feel ashamed.

21
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:58,774
And now, there are no more people in these churches. There are no more people. These TV’s are making them empty.

22
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:10,529
These things, and whatever they call them, they stay up late at night for them

23
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:24,454
Long ago when there were no TVs. There were only those portable stoves that would make rumbling sounds, none of these.

24
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:35,172
So what can you advise of us young people so that we will be good workers?

25
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:46,861
You see, the Caucasians like those who work well, one who doesn’t mess around but focuses on work..

26
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:51,183
Those are the ones they like.

27
00:03:52,062 --> 00:04:00,017
One who is distracted when working cannot stay long.

28
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:07,968
And a worker who works at the co-op down there and messes around cannot stay long.

29
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,438
They fires them.

30
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:13,699
Do you still work at the cannery?

31
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:15,594
I stopped.

32
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,621
Instead, I started getting money from [?].

33
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:32,356
The ones who receive money give them to who’s responsible, including food.

34
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:48,040
You’ve probaby heard of traditional wisdom from your elders. Please talk about those.

35
00:04:48,059 --> 00:05:05,159
My late father always said to me, :"Never be lazy. If I’m lazy, you know of the fish down there

36
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:10,800
"Even if I see them and don’t know how to set a lead line, I will be hungry."

37
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:15,987
I’ve never been hungry since then.

38
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:19,231
I’ve never been hungry.

39
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:29,376
And if you work well, they won’t fire you. You’ll be good.

40
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:39,177
Since I tried to work well, I stopped working.

41
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:45,120
And I wouldn’t go by boat, but always with a plane.

42
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:52,736
I became the first in the airport across there, and they’d always call me first.

43
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:59,749
When we were going to come, they’d call me first. And when we were going to disembark, they’d also call me.

44
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:03,035
You see, that’s why I’d be ashamed.

45
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:05,788
I was always first.

46
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:12,866
Look, you shouldn’t mess around either. I’m going to tell you.

47
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:22,137
You are a worker. If you work without messing around, they won’t fire you.

48
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:31,829
I also wanted to tell you that I’ve reached this age before I’ve been fired.

49
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:43,995
And my leg here is [?] starting from here. I have injured legs. And this one is plastic with two screws.

50
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,712
How much did flour cost back when things were inexpensive?

51
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,609
They were inexpensive, $3.

52
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:58,115
How much did they weigh?

53
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:03,296
A 50 lb. bag was very inexpensive, $3.

54
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,714
And tea was $2.

55
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:08,859
It was inexpensive.

56
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:16,256
Now, they’ve become difficult [to get]. They’ve become difficult.

57
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:22,871
What they took last year won’t be found.

58
00:07:22,882 --> 00:07:26,228
I won’t speak of the old boat motors.

59
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:33,428
How expensive was gas?

60
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:35,758
Five dollars...

61
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:46,581
A drum was $25. It’s very inexpensive [compared to] now.

62
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:49,489
Now, they’re difficult [to get].

63
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:56,487
And [motor] oil was $2. Motor oil, $2.

64
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:02,961
I wish things were inexpensive now. I wish they were inexpensive.

65
00:08:02,963 --> 00:08:09,185
Yes, they’re not difficult [to get], and things are expensive. They’ve gotten expensive.

66
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:19,746
If there’s a final thing you’d like to say, say the last thing now.

67
00:08:20,586 --> 00:08:24,463
Let me pray. Do you want me to?

68
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:25,691
Yes, if you want to.

69
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:26,783
Okay.

70
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:34,759
Oh, Lord Jesus, God. God, our father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.

71
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:39,843
May your kingdom come. May your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.

72
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:47,090
Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.

73
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:52,247
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.

74
00:08:52,266 --> 00:09:00,809
For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever and ever, amen. Thank you Jesus, amen.

75
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,069
Thank you.

76
00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:09,006
Now, try to always work well. (Okay.)

77
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,551
Now, you see, they fire those who don’t work well.

78
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:20,919
Caucasians like one who works well.

79
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:26,573
Now, before they fired me, [?].
