1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,230
Okay, ready.

2
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:14,680
Okay, what you just asked, what would I believe?

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,650
Our ancestors, this is what our ancestors believed.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,340
They said that we should especially believe this:

5
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:29,195
They said that the Spirit of the Universe is watching us below.

6
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:34,785
They said we shouldn’t forget that. They said that the Spirit of the Universe is watching us.

7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:45,630
Then they said that if we know that, we should take heed to advice.

8
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:50,275
We should follow the wisdom passed down to us.

9
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:59,805
They said that we would do well to take heed to advice, living without going against them.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:10,190
Then they said that our elders would say this to us: "A person who is called righteous..."

11
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,250
...what you said.

12
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:24,295
They said that if we do not forget that the Spirit of the Universe is watching us, that [Spirit] will give us wisdom.

13
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:30,405
And [the Spirit] will not have us disregard our elders’ instructions.

14
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:36,140
And they said that if we do that, we will become wise.

15
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,710
And we will be called articulate [teachers].

16
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,660
And like this: what he says must be accurate.

17
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,400
They said that everything he says must be true.

18
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:56,015
And they said that things would go as they say.

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:07,330
They said that if the Spirit of the Universe is grateful to us, he will make us like that if we respect him through everything we do.

20
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:17,160
Then they said that if we respect him, only if we respect all of our elders, we will respect the Spirit of the Universe.

21
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,260
That’s their traditional wisdom.

22
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:33,905
Through they never heard about the dead rising again, they used to think that if a person dies, he is dead and will never live again.

23
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:46,495
So if you know your ways, will you also be able to know what is good or bad in others’ ways as well?

24
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,190
Yes, yes.

25
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:55,185
About other people’s ways

26
00:02:56,335 --> 00:03:07,410
Other people’s ways here, the people who are called Caucasian work toward commotion

27
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,800
And especially the ways through these TV’s

28
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,570
Acting senselessly as our ancestors admonished against, focusing especially on being mischievous

29
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,260
And having some of our people focusing on it as well

30
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,490
This mischievous ways of our counterparts, the other people.

31
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,430
So, what’s a good way of the West?

32
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:41,510
You mean a good Western custom?

33
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,170
Well, other people.

34
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:53,015
Our good Yup’ik ways are also like this:

35
00:03:53,305 --> 00:04:04,075
Heed the advice of our elders in every village, even if they want them to live without commotion.

36
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:09,530
But they talk about one day.

37
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:17,680
In that day, though a person is mischievous all day starting from when he wakes up

38
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:27,260
They said [the opportunity] was open, and in the community house where they couldn’t have commotion, having commotion was open for one [day].

39
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:29,415
They said that’s what they were like.

40
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:38,685
You see, they wouldn’t have them stay [queit] all the time, but have them do that.

41
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:46,895
However, they said that when that day passed, they told them not to do that, told them to stay quietly.

42
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:58,795
Since they wanted to be happy like this through that, our ancestors would give them one [day] like that.

43
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:04,435
So, how will I know other people’s good ways?

44
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:14,730
If we see our peers, other people’s, good ways like this.

45
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,995
This is what our ancestors were like back then:

46
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:29,170
I lived over there were they herded reindeer. And they had separate rendeer here in Bethel that were their very own.

47
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:36,920
And they had their own reindeer in Akiak, and in Akiachak, and up in the mountains.

48
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:43,920
Those would herd separately like this without working together.

49
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,880
Then they would occassionally say this:

50
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:56,955
You see, the people from there or Akiak or Bethel would do that. They would take care of their own reindeer.

51
00:05:56,955 --> 00:06:03,235
And that custom they’d established was good.

52
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,650
Never would we go through there.

53
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:14,270
It was good that we started doing that, and their way was easy to follow.

54
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:23,170
They would follow that good way without rivaling each other.

55
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:30,630
These days, we should be like that as a Yup’ik Nation.

56
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:35,525
All of these villages have different customs.

57
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:38,945
They also want to accomplish different things.

58
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:52,930
As an example, the people here from Atmauthluak have accomplished something better, and we had never accomplished that before.

59
00:06:52,935 --> 00:07:02,685
We examined it and realized that if we did what they accomplished, we would do well through something better.

60
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:03,435
What?

61
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:07,625
How to take care of our land.

62
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:12,645
Also to own our land, that it should be set to us [in our care].

63
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:19,130
If we also do that with one mind, we will become stronger.

64
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,450
What is it?

65
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:24,090
We will proceed without commotion.

66
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,950
Here’s what it is:

67
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:38,760
We take this land of our very own and govern it, without letting others, Caucasians, who do not own it govern it.

68
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,930
We would govern our land as our ancestors governed it back then

69
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,710
Without letting others who’ve come from far away govern it.

70
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:58,485
We would do that in accordance to the right and good way they were.

71
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:06,440
However, if we follow the way of our counterparts, we will come to discord.

72
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,290
They will fight, and even claim ownership.

73
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:17,747
They will also grumble, saying that a person is walking through their land there.

74
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:22,277
We Yup’ik people’s ancestors did not have that.

75
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:27,737
Instead, they lived well without commotion.

76
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:35,487
Many times today, all of their parents work to earn money.

77
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:45,642
Among those, if they have children, who is going to teach their children about our culture?

78
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:54,542
These days, they’re like this: they try to earn money as our counterparts.

79
00:08:54,762 --> 00:09:03,772
Them even though some are instructed to work to earn money

80
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:12,482
When they get money, they only give it to alcohol to become crazy, hurt others, and get into misfortune.

81
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:20,662
They they tell their parents not to do that, to frugally take care of their money

82
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:24,782
They don’t take care of them, but use it to act insensibly.

83
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:29,812
That’s why after making the work a lot, they fire them.

84
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:37,782
When both of their parents are working, who is going to teach these children after they’re gone all day?

85
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:46,252
These parents will teach them, talking to them about how to work.

86
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:56,722
This is also how that person should work, a man or a woman:

87
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,792
They will only work hard if they’re obedient.

88
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,932
No, you didn’t understand my question.

89
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:03,727
Those with children today...

90
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:12,967
These parents who work today, and some have babysitters

91
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:17,877
Some of their babysitters are like this:

92
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:20,552
They tend to curse.

93
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:28,112
And the little ones would speak like their babysitters, swearing.

94
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:31,412
They don’t know what that is, don’t understand it.

95
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:38,652
Yet some babysitters, instruct them after their parents [leave].

96
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:43,072
And one who does that is rare who babysits well.

97
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:50,892
He instructs them on how to do well, and to be obedient though they’re very small.

98
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:54,322
He doesn’t instruct them on bad things.

99
00:10:54,362 --> 00:11:04,402
I know and see some very small children curse though they don’t know what they’re doing.

100
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:12,857
Their babysitter teachings them wrong on how to lead bad lives.

101
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:20,898
So today, how will we emotionally move our young people today?

102
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:29,104
How will we let them know about our traditions or good mindsets?

103
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:37,197
Particularly when they wake up in the morning, instruct them well.

104
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:43,584
No, these [youth] are now starting to follow their own minds.

105
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:47,394
How will we be able to fix them?

106
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:54,679
We can fix them how our ancestors back then used to fix them.

107
00:11:54,696 --> 00:12:02,230
Continually instruct them, speak to them, do not be harsh with them but make them feel affectionate.

108
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,826
Let them want to obey us.

109
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:17,051
Though they’re like that, and even if they do bad things, do not despise the bad things they do too much, but admonish and love them.

110
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:24,773
And explain to him the bad consequence of what he’s doing, saying that he needs to be [better] like that.

111
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:32,943
They say that one who always scolds him, or speaks harshly to him

112
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:39,124
Or like this: "Since you did it by yourself though you were told and disobedient, you are like that,"

113
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:46,443
They said that that is as forceful as a club to that one who does not heed advice.

114
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:55,722
However, they said that if one says this: "How different do you think I am from you? I am like you."

115
00:12:55,999 --> 00:13:01,766
Every person has one mind, is of one mind.

116
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:12,623
But, they said that historically, the traditional wisdom, though a person was called that, and though a person was called bad

117
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:19,335
They said that a person’s mouth has always fixed him, and makes him change his ways

118
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:22,214
Without getting tired of his [bad ways].

119
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:30,788
Then, do not be impatient, "When is he going to become obedient?" They said not to say that to him.

120
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:39,000
They said that one must not despair, but try to fix one who like that by speaking to him.

121
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:48,865
When they had community houses a long time ago, they would speak to the young men and teach them what to do in those community houses.

122
00:13:48,871 --> 00:14:00,126
But these days, in schools from way out there, they’re getting teachers who have separate cultures.

123
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:03,937
And their beliefs are very different.

124
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:09,810
And especially TV’s like that in schools.

125
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:20,466
Yes, through our youth learning about others’ cultures these days

126
00:14:20,654 --> 00:14:31,754
It’s causing them to be like that, not heeding advice, following their own mind, starting commotion as they are watching TV.

127
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,684
They watch it.

128
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:41,982
And this Bible instructs us like this:

129
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:55,355
"Their eyes are only watching desire, stealing, killing each other, and committing adultery."

130
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:59,787
We are looking right at those with our eyes.

131
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:08,838
That Western culture is especially leading our people astray.

132
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:13,919
Then to what we believe.

133
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:24,030
A person without faith cannot be healthy, and he will not fix his sickness well without faith.

134
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:28,450
That is the truth.

135
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:35,653
Those people who live without faith like that are already told about.

136
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:44,610
The Bible tells us, "A person who does not heed advice does not believe." That’s what the Bible says.

137
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:54,432
And back then among us Yupiat, a person who does not heed advice is called a non-believer.

138
00:15:54,986 --> 00:16:01,686
One who does not heed advice is called one without faith.

139
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:07,353
Since a long time ago, that’s what our ancestors called that person.

140
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:15,033
And they said that since the one who does not heed advice does not believe, he is living a bad life.

141
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:19,789
They said that he may be agile and strong

142
00:16:19,808 --> 00:16:33,552
However, they said that these elders, our ancestors back then, instead say this about that person who does not know what he’s doing and does not heed advice:

143
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,427
He is inhibiting.

144
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:42,893
They say he is like one, these days we say those on the verge of death are inhibiting.

145
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:51,116
They said that one who does not heed advice and follows his own mind is like that, inhibiting.

146
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:59,805
They said he is fated to do this: as he does not know what he’s doing, he will suddenly disappear, stumbling like this:

147
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:06,575
Sinking, or is killed, or he hurts himself.

148
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:08,903
He suddenly dies.

149
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:18,307
They say that he "stumbles" while he doesn’t know what hes doing, even though he was called a fast or strong person.

150
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:26,336
They said that for that reason, our ancestors called those who do not heed advice inhibiting.

151
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:35,363
Yupiit have traditional wisdom that are like their commandments, instructions. Those who follow them do well.

152
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:42,619
One of our instructions is like this: those of us...

153
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:49,624
And speaking like that is like this for our ancestors:

154
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:59,819
They say a person who is not very mindful does not instruct others’ children.

155
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:08,002
He only instructs his very own children on how they should do well.

156
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:11,303
They said, however, that he does not instruct another’s child.

157
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:18,978
They said that those who are like that are called unmindful and stingy [with knowledge].

158
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:28,511
They said that though they want their children to do well

159
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:35,345
They disregard another’s child and cannot instruct him.

160
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:46,173
They said that one with that mindset, though their father wants his own children to be good

161
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:51,501
They said that his chidlren instead will be [bad] like that.

162
00:18:51,819 --> 00:19:02,519
However, those children that he has not spoken to or instructed, they said that they will do what [he wants his children to] in his mind.

163
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:14,018
Then, they said that if we wish bad things upon a person, it will instead come upon our body.

164
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:19,600
Since they’ve repeatedly experienced and seen that

165
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:32,596
When a person changed his ways and his unmindfulness, they would talk about that so that the person in the next genertion would not be like that.

166
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:38,561
They told him not to live unmindfully, but showed him how to live well.

167
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:42,735
Without being embarrassed, he wants a person to do well.

168
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:50,217
They say a person who changes his ways becomes like that, instructing on everything he’s seen.

169
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:56,035
Then when I was growing up, I watched two women.

170
00:19:56,048 --> 00:20:04,804
In Akiak, though [another] was a guest and she saw him for the first time, she instructing him on how to do well.

171
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:08,202
She spoke to and enjoyed [the time] with him.

172
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:14,094
And the other was especially like that in Quinhagak.

173
00:20:14,107 --> 00:20:24,340
Even though the Caucasian didn’t understand Yup’ik, she spoke to her as if he did, making her laugh, really enjoying [the time] with her.

174
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:29,040
They enjoyed [their time] with them without discrimination.

175
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:35,314
Then one day, one of the Caucasian women said in church

176
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:47,188
She said that it was very certin in her mind that when she died, she went to Paradise because she was like that.

177
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:51,820
She spoke to and isntructed every person.

178
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:57,723
They say that one who wants every person to do well is righteous.

179
00:20:57,737 --> 00:21:05,959
They say that we should help others without thinking of being immediately paid by that person.

180
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:17,587
That is a traditional instruction like this, and I read this in the Bible in Peter’s writings:

181
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:26,747
"To one who is a leader, he should speak to and lead these people to do well.

182
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:34,286
"And do not think about being paid, but to lead them to righteousness."
