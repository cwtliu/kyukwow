1
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,510
Hello, I’m Mike Williams. I came from Akiak here.

2
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,250
But I work with mental health services.

3
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,890
Some time ago, we held a large gathering here to talk about traditional Yup’ik medicine

4
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,070
September 17 - 21st.

5
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:52,580
We met with this in mind: to strengthen our way of life in our lives here.

6
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,680
To improve these things here

7
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:06,200
To have our young people learn about the old Yup’ik way of life.

8
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:20,288
Also, we want to take care of and work on Yup’ik medicine that they used in their lives long ago.

9
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:29,543
They should learn about these old Yup’ik healers

10
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:35,433
Yup’ik acupuncturists, and the things they used back then

11
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:43,777
And write and put down these plants so that we will know them.

12
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:50,077
Also, we should learn these.

13
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:57,776
We should teach and learn these things that Yupiit used as medicine.

14
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:11,188
We also want these hospitals to use these kinds of medicine that Yupiit used

15
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:14,676
Here around us.

16
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:28,599
We also want these white people that came from downstates who work inland in the hospital to know about these kinds of Yup’ik medicine.

17
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:37,011
And these elders, those who’ve become old men and old women

18
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:44,533
We want their care to be better here

19
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:51,099
We also looked at how we don’t want them to be sent away from here.

20
00:02:51,466 --> 00:03:02,977
Now, Noel Polty who came from the Yukon here, will explain to us what Yupiit used as medicine.

21
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:10,565
Now, I’m going to say something true that I have experienced.

22
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:17,688
These things that I’ve scattered here are Yup’ik medicine.

23
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,877
I’ve taken them. I’ve taken all of them.

24
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:35,155
I’m also taking these pills here.

25
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:43,999
I am taking all of these together now. You see them.

26
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:48,344
These are [?] pills, and these are [?].

27
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:58,921
These will especially help a sick person. I am telling it without hiding it.

28
00:04:00,988 --> 00:04:09,977
Okay, then the wormwood here, we see these now.

29
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:16,333
You’ve seen these wormwood plants before. Here they are.

30
00:04:18,522 --> 00:04:24,344
If you have pains, if you have pains here on your body

31
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:29,299
Take this part off like this

32
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:41,321
After removing it, and if you want to pour tea on it, put it where the pain is and wrap it.

33
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:46,266
Use them to treat your body pains.

34
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:49,910
And if you have a lot of room, put that here too.

35
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:58,088
Personally, after I steep these in water as they are like this, I apply them here like this.

36
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:00,532
I used them like this.

37
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:03,033
They help me.

38
00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:08,854
When this is in pain, I use these. Here they are.

39
00:05:10,988 --> 00:05:18,199
This, after drying it and it gets dry like this one

40
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:23,366
When it gets dark like this [one], when it gets dark like this

41
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:29,477
Then crumple it like this. After crumpling it, add in Wesson oil.

42
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:39,088
Take this off a part of it and put it on an infected wound like this if it’s infected, and cover it.

43
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:45,921
All night, it will remove, pull out the infection inside right away.

44
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:53,133
And nothing [else] needs to be done, doesn’t need to be cleaned since it was pulled out.

45
00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:00,255
Also, if your body here is itching like this, itching terribly

46
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:09,332
After putting this in hot water, use it to wipe like this, wipe one’s body like this.

47
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:18,277
Also, if our heads are itching, tending to [?], put this kind here like this.

48
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:24,655
After putting it here, one should put a canvas on it and sleep all night.

49
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:30,988
He will wake up the next morning with that having pulled out the infection from his head in his sleep.

50
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:36,333
You know this, you know, that leaf tobacco, "cuyaq."

51
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:43,877
If one also has a big wound, if some person has a wound, or else if it’s two inches long

52
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:51,144
If there are no doctors, but if he has these blackbull leaves with him

53
00:06:51,199 --> 00:07:01,466
Without any other alternative, after filling that tobacco leaf with water, if he also puts it there and binds it

54
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:06,688
When it gets slack, when it gets white, it will not bleed.

55
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:09,266
It will also heal well.

56
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:16,543
And this, when we had toothaches, you know, when we had toothaches as small boys

57
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:23,332
We would take a piece of beaver castor, and they would have us bite it down on our teeth.

58
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:26,821
We used those for toothaches.

59
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,477
Also, a long time ago, along with using it for toothaches

60
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:37,443
I had these two smell this scent, the beaver castor scent.

61
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:41,755
There were two of them, this one smelled them, and the one over there smelled them.

62
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:47,065
They smell the same like that, and they’re like Western toothpaste.

63
00:07:47,077 --> 00:07:50,499
They also numb them like that.

64
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,988
You see these, this black thing. You see, this is black.

65
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:05,544
They’re what they call beach greens, the odiferous things they use from the land.

66
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:10,821
They smell strongly of those, and they’re good to eat, [?] very much.

67
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:18,132
If a person has a sore throat, his throat bothering him, if he has nothing as he travels in the wilderness

68
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:21,766
He should eat one of these, and swallow its juice.

69
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:32,066
Also, if one has a cold, if he is lost, when he eats this, though he eats and swallows it

70
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:35,332
It will emanate a scent inside

71
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:43,699
Like those, you know how Vicks emanates a strong scent? This will emanate a scent like that.

72
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,177
They call these beach greens.

73
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:49,854
Then these too

74
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:53,777
These especially.

75
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,121
These are different. You see these here.

76
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:05,999
This here is fresh.

77
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:14,321
This is freshly boiled. This is the liquid from this [plant]. This is what it’s like when fresh.

78
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:25,054
This is the male and female parts of wormwood.

79
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:29,910
It is potent when they’re boiled together.

80
00:09:29,922 --> 00:09:35,888
And it has this color because it’s not fresh, because it was dried.

81
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:48,311
These two, if a person has stomach problems inside, if something in his stomach is bothering him

82
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:59,654
And if he has stomach pains, or has a bad cough, or if his back here is bothering him

83
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:07,222
Or if he has malignant growths, those itchy malignant growths

84
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:15,844
If he doesn’t eat this, not as it is, if he boils it and drinks from here

85
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:25,177
If he drinks as the one across there said this morning, drinks in the morning, and drinks in the evening.

86
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:34,855
Then if he finds that too weak, he should add these like this

87
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:42,088
If someone drinks from here, if he drinks one cup from here, he will get dizzy.

88
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:47,277
These are strong when added together like this, with this added in.

89
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:57,177
But though it’s strong, when a person gets used to it, he drinks it as if thirsting for it.

90
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:02,643
Personally, I always drink a cup every morning, only from this potent one.

91
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:05,977
Look at me now.

92
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:12,499
I had been underweight, now I put some on from this.

93
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:23,054
I feel the full effects of these [traditional] medicine and these pills working together.

94
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:35,943
Then this is like these two, boiled like this. This has been boiled.

95
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:47,332
Some peopel from here call them trees, and we call them willow shoots, those willow shoots out there that moose eat.

96
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,821
Then boil it like this also.

97
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:57,666
To children, this is also very potent to children.

98
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:05,032
If he has sores, and cannot use his mouth, immediately pour it in his mouth, and it’s fine if he swallows it.

99
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:16,244
Use this for children with sores, and pour it on the sores that he has on his body, pour it even if they bleed.

100
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,733
It will also heal him right away.

101
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:28,466
And we adults, though we are adults, sometimes our mouths get sores as we go.

102
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:35,455
We drink, and we’re immediately not thirsty anymore. Using these is strong, potent.

103
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:43,066
Also, if a person’s body is itchy, like this too, like this

104
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:51,455
He will use it on his body when he takes a steam bath, or on his head..

105
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:57,743
And you know how their hands are so itchy like this that they can’t take anything like this.

106
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:06,788
Wash them in this as well, then after washing them, you don’t need to apply anything, just wash them like that.

107
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:15,954
This kind will also heal it, the, you know, willow shoot broth.

108
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:20,277
This is what I think:

109
00:13:20,377 --> 00:13:30,844
These Caucasians would give us [?] shots. When we have various sicknesses, they look at our ailment and give us shots.

110
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:33,766
Then I think

111
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:41,943
These, this is like [?], the shot they give, because it has many uses.

112
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:50,933
It also heals some who are sick. It also sometimes quickly heals those that it is meant to heal.

113
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:55,977
But if that person believes in it like this

114
00:13:55,988 --> 00:14:03,454
Like me, I highly value this wormwood here because it helps me.

115
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:11,210
I like to drink it, [beliving] it as much as those shots, because it helps.

116
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:19,832
Like that, Caucasians also value the [?] shot because it helps them.

117
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,600
Those [plants] also help me.

118
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:35,188
If these kinds of medicine work together, Western medicine, and our medicing, you see, it’s good.

119
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:41,199
Do not belittle Yup’ik [medicine], and do not belittle Western ones.

120
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:49,055
Me personally, I think like this:

121
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:56,588
These are God’s creations, having them grow on the land.

122
00:14:56,933 --> 00:15:02,977
The land is filled only with what God created.

123
00:15:03,055 --> 00:15:12,977
God made these to help us Yupiit, so that we could use them for healing and medicine.

124
00:15:12,988 --> 00:15:18,466
We look for the successful ways to use them by ourselves.

125
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:23,299
Through that, we must use them like that.

126
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,410
Through what we made, I cannot make wormwood.

127
00:15:27,422 --> 00:15:33,911
This is God’s creations for me to use, and for all of you to use.

128
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:46,455
Okay, I want to thenk Dela Keetz who came from Kotzebue in the [Iñupiaq] Malimiut region to show us these

129
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:50,866
Yes, their [traditional] medicine.

130
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:55,233
I thank her for showing us these.

131
00:15:55,966 --> 00:16:03,432
I’m Dela Keetz from... my hometown is Noatak

132
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:09,632
Around 75 miles from Kotzebue, inland.

133
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:19,544
I’m Dela Keetz from Noatak, 75 miles away from Kotzebue..

134
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:25,166
My family and I moved to Kotzebue in 1963.

135
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:35,732
But the people don’t know. I never try to show to the people the way I always help people at home.

136
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:48,399
I work at home, my hometown, try to help people all my life.

137
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,299
But though I was there and helped people, they didn’t know me

138
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,155
Because I work at home in our village.

139
00:16:56,165 --> 00:17:04,665
Because I try to help people, I am thankful when they get better, as if it were my own body.

140
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:15,544
My heart, always happy, just like I have a joy, happy all the time.

141
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:19,688
They’re just like my own body.

142
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:27,022
That’s why I love to help people, anyplace wherever I go.

143
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:34,677
I doesn’t been trained.

144
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:42,277
I never trained in the hospital, or in no place.

145
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:53,565
Just by my own experience, and from the books I’ve read when I’m in school.

146
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:57,900
I was so interested.

147
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:05,566
I wasn’t trained, and I wasn’t trained in the hospital, or in other places.

148
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:11,911
But I work with what I know from the books I’ve read in school.

149
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:21,166
And with what little I understood when I read about what I found interesting and fun

150
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:24,954
Because we didn’t grow up speaking English.

151
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:32,422
When sometime happen to us, when it’s injured or accident or anything

152
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:40,966
We should help this way or that way.

153
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:44,477
Especially, be clean.

154
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:52,510
But when we started reading, when our teacher had us start reading

155
00:18:52,522 --> 00:19:02,455
I used to be interested in how our bodies work, or how they work when we get into accidents or get hurt

156
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:06,022
And how we can be helped.

157
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:11,077
And how to take care of them, or if they have large wounds.

158
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:18,988
More importantly, they were instructed to work with clean hands.

159
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:22,066
That’s the way I learned.

160
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:26,243
Even though I didn’t write them down, I remember them.

161
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:31,632
I also always remember what the teacher had us read.

162
00:19:31,643 --> 00:19:38,099
When I try to help people through that, I try to help them through those things that are in my mind.

163
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,133
I never forget it. It’s in my mind all the time.

164
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:50,600
That is why I always help people when they need help.

165
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:58,843
I’ve got lot of things

166
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,855
Just a lot of things to say.

167
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:11,300
But what I do, I learned from myself.

168
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:18,688
I hurt myself one time and fell over.

169
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:24,311
And I’ve never went through that way where I fell.

170
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:25,977
...in my life.

171
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:31,977
I shoudl be careful when I use ulu or knife when I cut.

172
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:42,288
Then when I get cut usuing an ulu or a [Western] knife, I am also careful the next time I use them like that.

173
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,799
Just like that.

174
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:49,599
And when I hurt on myself

175
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:54,433
Like one time...

176
00:20:55,155 --> 00:21:00,755
Once, when we were playing, I hurt myself.

177
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:09,444
When we had a wide mouth contest, I opened my mouth too far trying to win.

178
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:15,144
...make more wider mouth like this.

179
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:18,110
And I so want to win.

180
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:23,177
I open my mouth wide, and I can’t close it.

181
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:29,311
It’s [?], it’s [?].

182
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:35,855
I try, I try to talk, I can’t talk.

183
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:44,588
And I couldn’t fix my mouth, and I couldn’t speak.

184
00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:52,555
Then without the knowledge of people, I [?worked on] my jaw though it hurt.

185
00:21:54,244 --> 00:22:04,810
So then I push it out while I was open...

186
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:10,411
I pulled them, then when I pushed again, they went right in.

187
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,744
I put it back in.

188
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:17,833
So, I know how to work on it.

189
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:23,132
I also know how to set jaws back like that.

190
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:30,233
Once, they called me to go help in Shaktoolik from Kotzebue.

191
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:38,632
Then when I went to Shaktoolik, because that happened to a girl there

192
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:48,454
Because their health aide, their nurse, could set [her jaw] back, (s)he had her go to Nome.

193
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:58,554
It may have been three days that her mouth was open, unable to eat or speak.

194
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:06,910
I traveled with her. When I arrived at Nome, I foudn that her mouth was open and she couldn’t speak.

195
00:23:06,922 --> 00:23:09,310
She couldn’t fix her mouth.

196
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:15,355
There were women there, and a lot of children, and they were even crying.

197
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:18,344
Water running.

198
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:25,677
She can’t talk. She can’t close his [her] mouth.

199
00:23:27,088 --> 00:23:33,266
And then there was ladies with lot of babies.

200
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:41,899
"Who’s this baby is this?" "That was mine," a young girl say. "You better take this crybabies out."

201
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,099
I asked whose child was the one that was crying.

202
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:51,288
One of the young girls said it was her child.

203
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:57,077
It turned out that it was the one who took the place of the nurse in Shaktoolik.

204
00:23:57,332 --> 00:24:03,977
When I told her to take her child out because I didn’t want to work in a noisy environment, she took [the child] out.

205
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:11,355
Apparently, she was curious about how to set [the girl’s] jaw back.

206
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,899
Take her out running next door.

207
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:18,099
Before [s]he come back, I fix it already.

208
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,299
"Ah, you fix it already? I was going to catch you [?]."

209
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:29,444
I show him [her] how to. She so want to see me; she so want to watch.

210
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:34,122
But before she came back, I fixed them again.

211
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:43,199
Then when she came back, I instructed her how to set a jaw back if that happens.

212
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:52,832
Just as you hold a small spoon to put sugar in your cup, hold the jaws to the side like that.

213
00:24:52,843 --> 00:24:57,055
And hold their head tight.

214
00:24:57,066 --> 00:25:01,721
Pull it outward. They set right back when doing that.

215
00:25:02,677 --> 00:25:06,833
Just lift it up little bit. It’s easy.

216
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:14,855
Don’t have to sent it to, way off to hospital.

217
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:18,422
Don’t have them go to the hospital.

218
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:26,855
Then one time, when they held a large gathering in Anchorage, they chose me to speak.

219
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:33,510
Then I spoke about what to do when your shoulder gets dislocated.

220
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:45,177
And I talked about when you hurt your shoulder.

221
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:56,833
If you hurt this side, left side, can’t lift your arm, be hurt, it’s hurt, don’t want to lift alright.

222
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:02,811
If you hurt your left side like that, [unable] to lift your arm up

223
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:13,533
It may be painful, but if you don’t want to go to the doctor, you can pull it up with your other arm and set it

224
00:26:13,544 --> 00:26:16,066
Because I’ve done that.

225
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:19,966
I hurt my shoulder

226
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:30,166
Then I tried to pull it up as I was standing. I pulled it up with my other arm, and it set.

227
00:26:30,177 --> 00:26:33,099
Then I kept it limp.

228
00:26:33,122 --> 00:26:36,455
Then I moved it around.

229
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:41,388
When I tried that, it got better, got set back in.

230
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,155
You can do it by yourself like that too.

231
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:55,199
When they held their meetings, one of the men fell on the stairs, hurting his shoulder.

232
00:26:55,222 --> 00:27:00,477
He remembered it, "Didn’t Dela tell us to do that?"

233
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:09,621
Then when he tried to set it, he set it back there where the people who went to the meeting were lodged.

234
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:25,077
Now, I also want to tahnk Marcelas williams who came from Native American territory downstates, a Native American healer.

235
00:27:25,088 --> 00:27:33,632
He will also talk to us about these, but Joe Albright will provide translations.

236
00:27:33,855 --> 00:27:41,011
...villages along the creeks, that’s where these medicine things grow.

237
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:53,710
He siad that back when they were going inland to the villages, they settled on the riverbanks, because those medicinal plants grew on the riverbank.

238
00:27:54,143 --> 00:28:02,588
When the white man found us there, they called us Cree Indians because we live by the creeks.

239
00:28:02,988 --> 00:28:12,455
He said that when these white people found them, they called them River People

240
00:28:12,466 --> 00:28:16,454
Because they were setlled by the rivers back there.

241
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:28,766
If you have some children, infants, sometimes look at the base of the spine.

242
00:28:28,777 --> 00:28:36,444
And if they got a blue spot right on the base of the spine, right along in here, then you and I are related.

243
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:42,344
Then, he said that if you watch your children

244
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:53,054
Here on their backs right above their midsection down there, if you see a blue spot

245
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:57,955
He said to know that we are related to them through that.

246
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:01,143
Don’t look mine. He’s too old.

247
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:07,532
He said not to look at his clothes.

248
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,421
The little guys. Look at the little ones.

249
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:28,422
Everywhere, wherever you go, all kinds of people, black, yellow, brown, white, blue, green, or whatever

250
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:35,888
We all share something in common: we are either healthy or sick.

251
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:44,632
He said that everywhere on the land, or if you go anywhere in the world

252
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:51,421
He said no matter what people are like, even if their skin is black or white

253
00:29:51,510 --> 00:30:01,210
He said they’re the same. And what they’re like, they all suffer from sickness.

254
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:09,344
Even among white people, there are different kinds of white people within that group.

255
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:15,655
And even though we call these people white, they’re not exactly the same.

256
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:21,121
They’re not of the same origin. The ones we call white are not the same.

257
00:30:22,144 --> 00:30:27,088
To ones in Washington, D.C., we call them from the Paper Tribe.

258
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:32,288
Everything is done on paper, [?] and all that.

259
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:43,422
He said that the people from the city downstates that he mentioned, they’re called the Paper Tribe

260
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:48,199
Because they work with [official] paper[work].

261
00:30:51,188 --> 00:31:00,577
There are some referred to as hillbillies, and they also have folk ways, folk medicine.

262
00:31:02,955 --> 00:31:09,111
It seemed that he called what we hear about a hillbilly

263
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:14,355
They are part of the ones who practice [folk] medicine.

264
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:22,454
[?] of mankind exist wherever they live.

265
00:31:23,522 --> 00:31:28,644
They always learn something from their area.

266
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:38,422
He said that everywhere on the land, they are the same in that they can learn something of their land.

267
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:50,199
If all of my people moved over here in this part of Alaska, they’d all probably starve to death this next winter.

268
00:31:50,811 --> 00:32:00,833
He gave an example. He said that if his people moved here to our lands, they’d probably starve to death.

269
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:05,489
And if you all came to my country, you might melt.

270
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:11,788
And he said that if we went to his lands, we would probably melt.

271
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:20,988
But in this time, we learn to adjust, we learn to adapt, we learn to live off the land.

272
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,422
We learn for things that you can eat, thigns that you can use for medicine.

273
00:32:26,677 --> 00:32:34,177
But he said that even if it doesn’t happen right away, a person keeps learning slowly.

274
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:38,688
He can also learn what he can eat from the land

275
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,422
Or he will also learn what he can use as medicine from there

276
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:49,143
In the workshop we’ve been having, attending

277
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:57,355
Each one has some knowledge about the land, and we’ve been sharing this knowledge all week.

278
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:07,411
Now, as we’ve been having these meetings, we’ve been hearing about what people know and have learned

279
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:15,221
The things people found out and learned about in their lands.

280
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:22,955
I’d like to just stay on for a long time and learn many of your ways.

281
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:28,866
For instance, we have lots of teachings in my tribe, similar to yours.

282
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:41,610
When a woman is expecting a child, when she goes out the door and changes her mind, we tell her not to turn around at the doorway.

283
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:44,477
Go on through, and then come back in.

284
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:52,766
Now, he wants to stay here from a long time so that he can learn.

285
00:33:52,777 --> 00:34:03,855
As he’s been listening now, he sometimes recognizes his people’s teachings and instructions back home

286
00:34:03,855 --> 00:34:13,043
And what he talked about today, it is in accordance to our ancestors instructions here.

287
00:34:13,055 --> 00:34:15,555
He used this as an example:

288
00:34:15,566 --> 00:34:21,344
He said that back at his home downstates, his people have this traditional instruction:

289
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:33,377
When a young lady is pregnant before giving birth, if she things of going out, then changes her mind about wanting to go out

290
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:37,522
Ignoring her change of mind, they tell her to go right out.

291
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:42,966
He said his ancestors have that traditional instruction.

292
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:54,088
We have learned much from the white man, good and bad.

293
00:34:54,444 --> 00:35:05,500
He said that we’ve learned much from these white people among us, good and bad all the same.

294
00:35:06,444 --> 00:35:11,744
Among all people, there are some good, there are some bad.

295
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:18,044
He said it’s like that, with people being different among their own.

296
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:22,443
He said that people are like that, as he said.

297
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:34,788
If we look for something bad in other people, that will be easy to do. There’s something bad in all of us.

298
00:35:35,255 --> 00:35:40,677
But it’s another thing to look for something good. It’s the better way.

299
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:52,188
Then, he said that if we [?] those around us [?looking] for something bad to be shown in those around us

300
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,277
He said that’s easy.

301
00:35:54,288 --> 00:36:01,755
But there is also a place for something good.

302
00:36:04,521 --> 00:36:15,410
Another thing that we all have in common is destruction

303
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:23,044
By nature, and by man-made destruction.

304
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:30,488
He said that we will find out and hear about this.

305
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:38,033
It’s been shown that a person can be destoryed through something

306
00:36:38,044 --> 00:36:42,122
Or that he cane by destroyed by man-made things.

307
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:55,677
In nature’s destruction, there’s floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fire, and things like that.

308
00:36:56,132 --> 00:37:03,855
He just mentioned the ways that people can be destroyed through natural phenomena

309
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:10,599
Through those, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.

310
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:18,266
Through those, or through floods, people can be destroyed through those.

311
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:25,932
Man-made destructions, there’s a lot of things. The list is too long.

312
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:29,288
There’s bombs, [?war ?].

313
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:35,811
World powers can’t live together. They must try to dominate one another.

314
00:37:36,266 --> 00:37:46,633
He said that there are different ways people can be destroyed by these man-made things.

315
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:54,300
Many people are also destroyed through bombs, or through war.

316
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:04,933
Trying to take over and dominate those around them, many people are destroyed through that.

317
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:16,554
This earth on which we live is known as a planet. It is a planet.

318
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:24,222
He said that our land where we live, I don’t know how to translate it.

319
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:32,744
But if I say it, you students will recognize it. The place we live is called a planet.

320
00:38:33,966 --> 00:38:39,532
There are nine in what we call solar system.

321
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:44,844
There are nine planets in this area around the sun.

322
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:55,166
He said there are nine planets like ours here around the sun.

323
00:38:56,366 --> 00:39:04,599
So far as we know now, this is the only planet that has life.

324
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:10,033
He said that in all of their examinations, though there are that many

325
00:39:10,044 --> 00:39:16,444
He said that where we live now is the only one that supports life.

326
00:39:17,633 --> 00:39:23,244
With all the different people over our earth

327
00:39:24,877 --> 00:39:33,399
We have a very unique place. This earth is very special.

328
00:39:33,711 --> 00:39:41,611
The Great Ones above saw to it that this will be a special place for man to live in.

329
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:47,566
He said that as they examined our world

330
00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:53,477
And though the other planets like where we live now are planets

331
00:39:53,488 --> 00:40:04,044
But the One Above who watches over us knows that this place of ours is the only one viable to live in.

332
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:10,966
Many people refer to this earth as Mother Earth.

333
00:40:11,255 --> 00:40:18,788
He said that many people refer to our earth here as a Mother.

334
00:40:19,977 --> 00:40:26,921
My tribe has an endearing term. We call it Grandmother Earth.

335
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:37,443
And his people call it Grandmother Earth.

336
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:49,366
It makes us sad many times to see our Grandmother’s face all spot up, gouged out, without putting anything good back into it.

337
00:40:49,766 --> 00:41:02,121
He said that when this Grandmother is mistreated and [?gouged]

338
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:04,421
It’s sad to see.

339
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:12,877
Every little thing has life. Even a little blade of grass, a little weed has life.

340
00:41:12,877 --> 00:41:22,866
Little tiny bugs, animals, birds, fish, everywhere there’s life all around, and we respect them.

341
00:41:23,555 --> 00:41:29,766
He said that everything we see on this land where we live

342
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:40,377
He said that everything, even plants or little birds, everything has life.

343
00:41:40,388 --> 00:41:42,888
They’re alive.

344
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:49,144
He said that we who know about them treat them with respect.

345
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:55,888
I have learned much from the people from different villages.

346
00:41:55,899 --> 00:42:04,610
They have learned much from this Mother Earth, something they can use in what we call Yup’ik medicine.

347
00:42:04,988 --> 00:42:14,899
He said that as we’ve been meeting, he has learned a lot that has been demonstrated through different peoples

348
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:24,733
The plants that grow on Mother Earth that are useful for us who populate this earth.

349
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:32,433
The white man has a word called "poverty."

350
00:42:33,522 --> 00:42:46,900
He said that our white counterparts have a word that he just said in their language, "poverty."

351
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:52,833
In my understanding, if I’m not understanding it wrong, it means to be poor.

352
00:42:54,066 --> 00:42:59,366
Poverty usually means somebody without means, income, money.

353
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:06,233
Since poverty means to be poor as I just explained

354
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:13,511
It’s a word used for someone who is short on everything, one who lacks.

355
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,233
But there is another poverty:

356
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:25,233
If you have no old people for many knowledge that they have, they don’t share and go on and

357
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:28,111
We are left without nothing, without guidance.

358
00:43:28,111 --> 00:43:31,577
That would be a terrible poverty.

359
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:42,010
He also said that a person may be poor in worldly things, being short on [material] riches.

360
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:47,343
But, he said that this is another part of how a person can be poor:

361
00:43:47,355 --> 00:43:57,688
When many elders do not explain to their descendants things that they should learn, that they should know.

362
00:43:57,699 --> 00:44:02,121
He said that’s part of being poor.

363
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:10,988
If you sit in on meetings, you will find that you are very rich.

364
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:19,721
If you could sit in on our meetings, hearing these people share their knowledge

365
00:44:19,732 --> 00:44:25,477
You will find that you are very rich to have people with this kind of knowledge.

366
00:44:25,844 --> 00:44:34,711
He said that if you listen to the poeple who’ve been speaking as we’ve been meeting that we’ve been listening to

367
00:44:34,721 --> 00:44:41,132
He said that you would find through that it’s like we are rich.

368
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:49,277
People have been explaining things they are knowledgeable about and know since we’ve started.

369
00:44:49,288 --> 00:44:56,632
Through a person’s knowledge like that, he will be like a rich person.

370
00:44:59,077 --> 00:45:05,488
In sickness, it usually is in the body or in the mind.

371
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:14,410
He said that in sickness, a person is sick either in his body or in his mind.

372
00:45:15,555 --> 00:45:22,044
There is another part of us to make us whole, and that is the soul of man.

373
00:45:22,655 --> 00:45:31,977
He said that we have one thing of our own.

374
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:38,999
If you know the ancestors’ concept, you will recognize the soul.

375
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:43,221
We explain that as the part of us that doesn’t die.

376
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:52,266
We rely great things upon what this soul tells this body and this mind to do.

377
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:59,322
He said that many times, we depend on our soul

378
00:45:59,455 --> 00:46:06,977
Including when we think about the things we sorely need something.

379
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:12,899
We feed our bodies, clothe it, wash it.

380
00:46:13,311 --> 00:46:19,288
We exercise our mind. But what about this soul?

381
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:31,900
He said that we do things to our body to protect it, feed and groom it.

382
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:37,644
But, he said, what are we going to do with the part of us that doesn’t die?

383
00:46:40,488 --> 00:46:46,821
This soul, in most every one of us, have experienced poverty

384
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:52,788
Because we don’t nourish it, we don’t feed it, we don’t exercise it.

385
00:46:53,055 --> 00:47:02,844
He said that many times, we cause our soul to be destitute

386
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:07,710
Only because we don’t feed it.

387
00:47:08,455 --> 00:47:18,666
As I look around form the very smallest to the very oldest, all of us have souls, and you are beautiful.

388
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:33,244
He said that as he watches from here, from your very little children to your elders, he said that all of you have souls.

389
00:47:33,255 --> 00:47:35,421
He also said you’re beautiful.

390
00:47:37,243 --> 00:47:43,143
All of us have much to contribute, much to give, all of us

391
00:47:43,977 --> 00:47:47,900
And be helpful to one another.

392
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:54,188
He said that all of us can help those around us

393
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:59,788
And we all have gifts we can use to help those around us.

394
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:10,233
There was a story of a man who worked on the railroad, come home every other day.

395
00:48:10,443 --> 00:48:17,866
He said that there’s a story of a person who worked on the railroad.

396
00:48:17,877 --> 00:48:24,077
He said that that person only returned home every other day.

397
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:32,888
He had three children: one boy, a girl, and another small boy.

398
00:48:33,044 --> 00:48:41,300
He said that that person had two male children, and a girl was the third.

399
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:50,033
The two older children, the boy and the girl, when they see their dad coming home

400
00:48:50,399 --> 00:48:57,111
They run out into the field, pick pretty flowers to give to their daddy.

401
00:48:57,377 --> 00:49:06,789
Then he said that when the two elders of his children, the boy and the girl, [?].

402
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,011
He said that when their father came into view, they’d go out to meet him.

403
00:49:12,021 --> 00:49:19,755
Then he said that they would pluck out pretty flowers, and give their father [flowers].

404
00:49:19,922 --> 00:49:26,744
The little boy was paralyzed from waist down. He could not walk or run.

405
00:49:26,788 --> 00:49:34,144
He said that that youngest boy’s waist was paralyzed.

406
00:49:35,188 --> 00:49:38,199
He couldn’t walk around like the other two.

407
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,522
And little pieces of wood.

408
00:49:41,132 --> 00:49:47,121
When the older boy and girl get the flowers picked

409
00:49:47,122 --> 00:49:52,811
They’d run to meet daddy. "Here, I picked this for you," and give it to him.

410
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:57,544
He said that because the first two were active and healthy

411
00:49:57,555 --> 00:50:03,555
After taking flowers from there, they would run to meet their father

412
00:50:03,555 --> 00:50:10,211
Telling him that they’re giving him [flowers[, that they had picked them for him.

413
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:14,721
When dad walked into the yard

414
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:24,599
This little boy that can’t run, can’t walk, wanted to give something too, little dirty stick, little dirty rocks.

415
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:28,933
But in his own way, "Here, daddy, here."

416
00:50:29,121 --> 00:50:36,266
He said that because their youngest sibling unfortunately couldn’t do as his siblings

417
00:50:36,277 --> 00:50:44,599
Without meeting his father when he appreaed, he would gather those little rocks and little sticks.

418
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:50,388
He said that he only extended his hand to give his father those gifts when he arrived.

419
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:56,199
That’s why I say everyone has something to give one another

420
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:03,055
If that one thing that we can give is love from our hearts.

421
00:51:03,421 --> 00:51:07,288
That’s why he just said this:

422
00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:12,643
All of us, with no exceptions, every one of us has gifts to give those around us.

423
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:20,866
He said that this [is what we can give] if we have no other gifts: only to treat those around us with love.

424
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:25,844
It iis love that unites us together.

425
00:51:25,855 --> 00:51:29,400
Regardless of color, we eat.

426
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:35,377
When he pray, he pray to God, "Thank you for this."

427
00:51:35,388 --> 00:51:41,799
When you partake of this food, each one, even a small portion, partake of it

428
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:46,866
We all became blessed as one people.

429
00:51:47,388 --> 00:51:56,711
Then he used this as an example of how we are united, though we act as if we are separate:

430
00:51:56,711 --> 00:52:02,655
There were a lot of different foods here, all completely different

431
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:12,322
But he spoke of my prayer to God, being thankful for this food and asking for the to be blessed before we received them.

432
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:24,266
Then even though they were completely different, all of us who partook in that received the things that were blessed for us.

433
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:35,000
Many times, I feel lonely. I’m not along, but I feel onely sometimes.

434
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:42,666
I have a father that died first.

435
00:52:42,677 --> 00:52:50,521
And then my son was killed when he was 17 years old.

436
00:52:51,033 --> 00:52:55,544
My mother lived to be over 100 years old

437
00:52:55,544 --> 00:53:00,522
And I buried her not too long ago.

438
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:03,155
They’re waiting for me.

439
00:53:03,655 --> 00:53:08,677
But until that day comes when I will go to meet them

440
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:14,566
I want to make the most of this life while I’m still living here today.

441
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:23,032
He said that now, he sometimes feels lonely and sad.

442
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:30,532
He said it’s because he had a father, and his father passed away.

443
00:53:30,533 --> 00:53:35,622
He knows [?], he knows that they’re waiting for him.

444
00:53:35,622 --> 00:53:46,922
But, he said that what exacerbates [his loneliness] is that he had a son who was killed when he was 17 years old.

445
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:53,799
Then, he said that he had a mother who eventually reached 100 years old.

446
00:53:53,810 --> 00:54:01,099
He said that he recently buried his mother, but he knows she’s waiting for him.

447
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:08,855
That’s why he said that he awaits the day when he will see those that he misses so dearly.

448
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:18,366
He said that for that reason, he has a desire to work as much as he can on the earth while he’s alive.

449
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:28,266
You have helped to fill the emptiness in my heart

450
00:54:28,277 --> 00:54:33,599
And I am grateful, and I thank God for all of you.

451
00:54:33,933 --> 00:54:37,833
He said that he speaks of this now:

452
00:54:37,843 --> 00:54:45,399
He said that it truly seems that you have filled what was empty [in his heart].

453
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:51,366
He said that for that reason, he thanks God for that.

454
00:54:51,777 --> 00:54:54,266
God bless you, one and all.

455
00:54:54,277 --> 00:54:58,455
May God bless you all.

456
00:54:59,622 --> 00:55:10,144
Okay, now I will go over what we established when we held our large gathering.

457
00:55:10,155 --> 00:55:21,533
We established these meetings where the ones who would speak to people would gather.

458
00:55:21,543 --> 00:55:29,188
Also, if we in these villages start having these elders become instructors

459
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:37,477
These old men would speak to these young men

460
00:55:37,488 --> 00:55:48,777
And these old women would also instruct these young women about our way of life.

461
00:55:48,844 --> 00:55:58,066
We also want these schools to do this, without refraining from doing so:

462
00:55:58,066 --> 00:56:04,344
We want them to teach about our people’s lives back then.

463
00:56:04,566 --> 00:56:17,177
We also want YKHC to greatly consider the negative effects of alcohol

464
00:56:17,188 --> 00:56:19,454
Because it is a problem.

465
00:56:19,488 --> 00:56:27,611
We also want to improve [the care of] the elders here around us.

466
00:56:27,621 --> 00:56:36,110
We want the care of our elders here in the villages around us to improve.

467
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:46,666
Also, these people marry close relatives and have abnormal children.

468
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:57,933
We also met about how we don’t want these people to marry those to whom they are too closely related.

469
00:56:57,988 --> 00:57:08,866
We also met about how we want these people to keep holding meetings.

470
00:57:09,444 --> 00:57:14,555
We will not repeatedly meet about these Yup’ik types of medicine.

471
00:57:14,566 --> 00:57:25,233
We also met to work on Yup’ik instruction for people.
