1
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,870
This hand has become dextrous, and this is getting dextrous.

2
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:17,425
Oh, thank goodness. (Yes.)

3
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:25,265
But now, they are too weak to grab things, unlike before.

4
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:32,605
That’s why I don’t grab anything heavy.

5
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:37,925
But my dear grandchild takes care of me.

6
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:39,325
Where’s he from?

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,020
My grandchild is from here.

8
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:49,985
He has a mother. His mother has a house down there.

9
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:54,145
He’s my grandchild.

10
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:10,855
Last year, I was not comfortable with this when it was paralyzed.

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,750
It was weak.

12
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:22,110
Even now, I am still careful about grabbing anything heavy with it.

13
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:26,635
I wonder what would’ve happened to you if he didn’t take you to the hospital?

14
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:29,055
I don’t know. Well...

15
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,765
...now, get a good shot, and...

16
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:35,305
What’s your Yup’ik name?

17
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,310
I’m Cuukvak.

18
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,870
My late mother would always call me Cuukvak.

19
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:59,460
We will show these story about cloudberries and how they pick berries in recent times

20
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:03,070
How people pick berries for Eskimo ice cream.

21
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,320
 There you have it.

22
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,710
Did you also do that when you were small?

23
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:17,040
Me, my mother was alive, and my sister was alive, Mary Evon’s grandmother down there

24
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,425
I’m related to those dear ones down there.

25
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:24,235
She’s their grandmother. Their grandmother.

26
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:39,742
Their mother is my older sister’s adopted older sister.

27
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,282
Would you pick berries?

28
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:44,786
Yes, we would pick berries.

29
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:50,573
Oh my, I would wish to go with them as a little girl.

30
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:58,818
My mother would refuse me saying that I would start crying and that I was too slow.

31
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:04,428
I would sometimes stay behind.

32
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:09,572
When I was insistent sometimes, she would take me with her.

33
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:14,090
How would you travel to pick berries long ago?

34
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,866
Long ago, we would travel only by walking.

35
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:26,218
Down toward the water from Bethel, there was a large expansive sandbar.

36
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:33,754
And the creek here was Kepenkuyagaq. Then toward the water from there was the Kuskokwim.

37
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:41,525
Because it was a big sandbar, we would go downriver under Ekvik.

38
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:53,324
And through there, since there was a path up toward the water from the hospital that was shoveled

39
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:56,109
We would go up through there.

40
00:03:56,119 --> 00:04:07,585
And then when they went home, they would go upriver under Ekvik again no other way but walking.

41
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:13,350
How did they make their first Eskimo ice cream? What did they use to make Eskimo ice cream?

42
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:20,204
They would make Eskimo ice cream out of, you know, a little tallow.

43
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:29,621
And people I used to see back then would render tallow.

44
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:38,731
It turned out that my mother would be the one to make Eskimo ice cream during dance festivals.

45
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:49,670
As I was playing, I would go into that little house, a little food cache, to find my mother making Eskimo ice cream.

46
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:57,664
She would help by bringing something for the people in the community house.

47
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:08,428
Okay, when the men would stay in the community house long ago, would you prepare their food?

48
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:23,121
When they asked me to invite people from the community house as a little girl, I would constantly invite the wrong people.

49
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:30,329
When Agayuur’s wife asked me to invite him from the community house

50
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:38,801
Because there were a lot of people sleeping in the community house, I would wake a random one.

51
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:42,597
They would wake up and this would be a different person.

52
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,865
I would then tell him that Oscar was invited.

53
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,406
They would then go to him. I would go out and leave them.

54
00:05:54,548 --> 00:06:02,148
How did they prepare, I mean, how did they store the berries that they picked?

55
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:09,405
They would store them in containers, then put them into barrels.

56
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:15,243
They prepared the berries they picked for storage in barrels

57
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:21,167
So that they wouldn’t be affected by anything repulsive.

58
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:29,797
Yet all winter, the people back then would always make Eskimo ice cream.

59
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,549
They would feed us Eskimo ice cream.

60
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:36,496
Would they make them with different things?

61
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:39,569
Yes. (Separately?)

62
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:40,332
What?

63
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:42,762
Would they make some of them differently?

64
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,623
I don’t know. Well...

65
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:50,599
The cranberries would be a little different

66
00:06:51,655 --> 00:07:03,288
As I have seen, when I took a husband and started traveling in the Akula region, I would pick cranberries.

67
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:14,507
As I have seen, I would put it fish roe, you know, even pike roe.

68
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:22,158
I would put in fish roe and crush them in a bowl, completely crush the roe.

69
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:32,040
And then when it was time, I would add cranberries

70
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:35,611
Then I would crush the cranberries.

71
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:43,454
Then I would whip it to have it increase in volume occasionally adding a little seal oil.

72
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:52,220
It would increase and fill the old wooden bowl with a lot of Eskimo ice cream.

73
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:53,741
Would they say...

74
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:58,639
They called those qerpertat.

75
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:01,775
Do they still seem to make it today?

76
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:05,466
Yes, they still make some today.

77
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:09,244
They make it because they know how to.

78
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:13,670
Do you get cloudberries now?

79
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:23,301
Ever since I’ve stopped picked berries, I haven’t gone, and I’ve stopped going to berry picking grounds now.

80
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:43,068
But when my grandchild and the others arrived and brought me cranberries they picked in that container, I made that as I’ve seen it.

81
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:50,257
I made qerpertaq as I’ve seen it. I knew how.

82
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:52,737
Do those have different names?

83
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,909
Or, here are the different names for Eskimo ice cream:

84
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,291
Yes.

85
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,373
Crushed fish eggs and berries

86
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,027
Yes.

87
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:01,903
But what’s tenguggluk?

88
00:09:01,912 --> 00:09:09,162
Tenguggluk is made from fish guts, salmon liver.

89
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:14,750
And then cutting some of their parts

90
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,539
After whipping the livers for tenguggluk

91
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:22,717
How does it go?

92
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:34,542
They squeeze the small fish livers then whip them.

93
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:36,141
Do you get it?

94
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:45,515
(Yes.) They would fill the bowl, add berries, and mix it.

95
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,632
But they would add seal oil.

96
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:51,008
I see. (Okay.)

97
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:53,216
Do you have anything else to add?

98
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,214
I’m not sure.

99
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,954
I don’t think I have anything else to add. (Okay, thank you very much.)

100
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:08,108
As I have seen, when I got married and we started traveling

101
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:15,486
I would try to pick cranberries when my children were alive.

102
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,767
I would also be worried about them and pick cranberries.

103
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:27,013
However, I would crush them to make Eskimo ice cream.

104
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:37,369
We and the children loved together along with Lloyd, Old Man Lloyd and his wife.

105
00:10:40,393 --> 00:10:43,413
Lloyd Nick and his wife.

106
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:50,529
We also lived together with Helen and her daughter.

107
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,965
And then when I was making Eskimo ice cream somewhere here

108
00:10:56,141 --> 00:11:04,887
Those children would come here to sit and watch, occassionally tasting it.

109
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:12,253
And when I added berries to it, they started eating. I ignore them and made the Eskimo ice cream without saying anything to them.

110
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:20,085
I would say to them, "Stop when you’ve had enough Eskimo ice cream. This is almost done."

111
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:26,054
Thank you. (Yes.) Thank you very much. (Yes.)

112
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:31,519
After I set it down there, I would look back and go out.

113
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,868
My male cousins would say to me, "Dance, dear ones."

114
00:12:40,554 --> 00:12:46,114
Oh my, I wouldn’t raise my hands to dance but go out and disappear.

115
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:54,020
What does ingulak mean? What explanation does the practice of ingulak have? What is it?

116
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:04,111
They hold the Ingulaq Festival towards fall like this.

117
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:10,171
I’m not sure what it means. I myself don’t know.

118
00:13:10,182 --> 00:13:15,016
(Would they do it after cloudberry season?) Yes, after cloudberry season.

119
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:20,720
But there was a lot of Eskimo ice cream in the community house.

120
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:24,502
They would always take them to the community house.

121
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:29,608
Even though there were a multitude of guests, they wouldn’t lack anything.

122
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:36,506
Would they know how much berries they picked by making a lot?

123
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:38,514
Yes.

124
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:41,999
I see.

125
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:43,282
Is that all?

126
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:45,764
Yes, thank you very much.

127
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,964
You didn’t ask me to speak too much.
