1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:12,450
Oh my, I was like that. I just told you the story.

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,890
Are we going? Is it better?

3
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:25,125
So now, how did these good shamans that didn’t needed to be scolded work?

4
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:30,275
They would use their shamanistic powers on people to heal them

5
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:37,255
And when they use their shamanistic powers on the sick to heal them without side effects.

6
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:42,815
They heal them so there was nothing left wrong with them.

7
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:52,610
And when they exercised their shamanistic powers in the community house on a person whom [others] had [attacked] with malice

8
00:00:52,610 --> 00:01:06,120
Some shamans, when they were faced with something invisible that they could take, when they did this with their arms and pulled what was invisible

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,280
Yet they had nothing [physical] to pull.

10
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:16,175
As one of the shamans kept pulling, they’d get pulled up as they lay there.

11
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:24,795
They said that what had been making that sick person sick

12
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,960
The ones that they did that to couldn’t deny it happened as they were there.

13
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,580
Those that were pulled up like that would stay without being able to deny that it had happened.

14
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:45,415
And they couldn’t say that nothing had happened.

15
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,125
There you have it.

16
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:55,100
Many of those people would experience delirium before death like that.

17
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,750
When some shamans who did not need apprehending exercised their shamanistic powers on them

18
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,820
They’d forgive them, confess them to those malicious shamans.

19
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,390
That’s what they were like.

20
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:15,615
They would confess unto them

21
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:28,990
Without their knowledge, or with some unknown force, they’d experience their own malicious intent.

22
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,260
Their malicious intent would fall upon them.

23
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:39,315
That’s what they were like.

24
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:45,485
I haven’t covered the entirety [about] I don’t know

25
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:50,115
But I used to hear about some of them like this.

26
00:02:50,115 --> 00:03:02,305
Okay, so when you were growing up back then, especially up to this day

27
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:11,225
Traditional wisdom that you remember, please talk about one that is still clear in your mind

28
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,610
The traditional wisdom you used to hear back from your elders back when you were a girl.

29
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:25,275
You see, a long time ago

30
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:36,880
Our instructors back then would instruct us, and it seemed they were scolding.

31
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:48,540
We poor people would listen, unable to move as we sat, getting hot, and our hands would get wet.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,850
We couldn’t move anymore when they instructed us.

33
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:55,981
This is what my mother used to say to me:

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,500
"Now, when you hear someone instructing you, watch you instructor’s mouth until [s]he stops.

35
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:12,069
"And though he seems to be directing at you, don’t look away from them, and watch their mouth until they’re done."

36
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:19,607
I’d also follow what my instructor said and do that.

37
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:29,676
"Though [s]he seems to scold you, watch their mouth. Only when [s]he’s done, look away."

38
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:32,552
I would do that.

39
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:41,389
Truly, a person who was there should not forget the traditional wisdom passed down to them.

40
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,095
We'd listen without being able to move.

41
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:57,001
Only when they they were done, that instructor, would we stand and leave them.

42
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:05,220
Only when [s]he finished with us, we’d stand away from them, only when [s]he finished with us.

43
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:14,814
We’d listen as they seemed to scold us. They’d seem to offend us, scold us.

44
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:23,564
Oh my, I wish their traditional instructions would come. When I come upon them, I recognize them.

45
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:26,752
I’d recognize everything.

46
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:34,096
I’d so recognize what some instructors would speak of.

47
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:38,027
What are some of those pieces of traditional wisdom?

48
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:42,558
They’d also tell us repeatedly

49
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:49,759
They’d also repeatedly tell that piece of traditional wisdom

50
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:59,572
Repeatedly, not letting them hear it once, but having them hear it repeatedly.

51
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:09,954
Oh my, the first people back then would speak of true things.

52
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:23,910
That’s why when some of these people, when these Yupiit speak on the Bible

53
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:31,510
And when I hear that the first doesnt need to be anymore

54
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:41,260
Or when I hear people say the first shouldn’t be done, I think like this

55
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:47,535
I think of the fact that Jesus said this:

56
00:06:49,773 --> 00:07:02,486
"I didn’t come to destroy the Law, but to complete it.

57
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:14,723
"I didn’t come to destroy a single part of it, but to complete it." That’s what he said.

58
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:22,792
I always remember this, that Jesus said.

59
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:30,430
So now, as I’m now this age

60
00:07:30,443 --> 00:07:41,518
When I come across that traditional wisdom, and when I recognize people

61
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:50,699
I would recognize what those instructrs would say.

62
00:07:50,712 --> 00:08:05,462
And when that person that they said would end up a certain way, when the time time, I'd remember what they said about what they'd be like.

63
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:09,706
They were like that.

64
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:22,525
Then as they're speaking and instructing them, when one person, and when one of my fellow girls went out, they'd [?decry] her.

65
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:27,951
"Oh my goodness that one. Why did they go out?

66
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:39,045
"They probably went out since they didn’t want to listen in order to live with whatever whims they have.

67
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:45,420
"When they come across what they liked, they’ll examine it for themselves."

68
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:49,908
They’d talk about them like that.

69
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:57,727
When they see what they liked, they’ll see themself.

70
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,046
They’d say this about them.

71
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:13,577
Those first traditional instructions are absolutely not bad.

72
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:19,433
That’s why the people who practiced them long ago lived long lives.

73
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:28,333
And when they moved them, their old bones would pop. They said they went out of [socket].

74
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:33,439
Or, they also carried them on caribou antlers.

75
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:43,558
They’d pop. Then when they put them where they were going to be, their old bones would be like shooting guns.

76
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:46,996
They said they went back into place.

77
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,415
You see?

78
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:57,290
From being so [?tightly clung] to life, [?tightly clung] to being alive.

79
00:09:57,303 --> 00:10:00,978
And they said some grew a new set of teeth.

80
00:10:00,997 --> 00:10:09,034
They’d call them "those with small new teeth." They said they looked like mink teeth.

81
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:12,822
They said those were "those with small new teeth."

82
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:18,516
Well, I wish I could get small new teeth since I have no more.

83
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:23,266
Were those after they lost their teeth...

84
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:27,872
After they lost their teeth, they’d be replaced by those.

85
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:33,872
Oh poor me, I’ve become like when I was young

86
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:38,353
I’d have my tooth removed when it gets loose.

87
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:47,484
Or, several of these, three, are starting to get loose.

88
00:10:47,885 --> 00:11:03,085
Then here on the top has no tooth, one without a tooth has a false tooth here, then this part has no more teeh, and two teeth here.

89
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:12,742
And the bottom here, there’s one tooth down in the middle, and several teeth out from there.

90
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:19,461
The other side, however, on the bottom hasn’t lost any.

91
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:28,105
Those people who lived long, you just said their bones would pop.

92
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:32,593
(Would they complain of aches?) They wouldn’t complain.

93
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:36,912
Though they seemed in pain, they wouldn’t complain.

94
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:43,494
They wouldn’t go "ouch" though they seemed in pain.

95
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:47,288
Their bones would pop like guns firing.

96
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:53,001
And when they put them down, they’d make loud noises.

97
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:59,908
They said their joints would go back in from where they came out.

98
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:16,596
Oh my, and our dear grandmother, poor thing, when we were going to move and they moved her from her mat with caribou antlers, she would do that.

99
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:25,271
And when they carried her and put her where she was going to be with a warm bed

100
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:32,078
Her old bones would pop in what they said they were going back in place.

101
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:42,122
Our grandmother would also tell us stories of what she was like.

102
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:53,441
She said she had taken one of the men as a husband, and he was called a shaman.

103
00:12:54,291 --> 00:13:00,391
She said she didn’t pay attention to her husband.

104
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:07,623
She said she wouldn’t sleep by him, and would go out when he came in at night.

105
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:13,511
One day, her husband left her.

106
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:19,255
She said though he wanted her as a wife, he was preparing to leave her.

107
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:24,530
After he left.

108
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:32,756
Do you hear about Cakcaarmiut out there on this side of Qaluyaat?

109
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:39,118
Cakcaarmiut, at this end of the mountains.

110
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:44,768
You see, she found a lover there.

111
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:50,143
She found a lover when another man came upon her.

112
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:56,924
She said he was a very handsome man with no equal in Alaska.

113
00:13:58,993 --> 00:14:07,206
And since she liked him, she was with that person in his prime.

114
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:16,093
Poor thing, she said that one day, one day she was bringing food gifts to people.

115
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:23,768
She said that since she had many food gifts, she held the bottom bowl, and these were on each other up to here.

116
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:28,544
She said she tried not to let them fall as she gave food gifts.

117
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:38,457
Then she came up, after giving them out to the owners of the bowls, after sitting and waiting, went out.

118
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:48,614
She went out. She said that after doing that, she went out, oh my, it seemed the world was so bright.

119
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:53,539
The moon was shining and it was very bright.

120
00:14:53,651 --> 00:15:01,576
Oh my, she said that when she turned from the door of the community house, she realized

121
00:15:01,882 --> 00:15:09,557
She said her old partner would tell her that he was going to get her.

122
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:13,638
He said he was about to get there.

123
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:21,438
She said that the area downriver down there doesn’t freeze though it’s so cold it crunches.

124
00:15:21,832 --> 00:15:29,182
Oh my, his kayak, a nice kayak down there was docked.

125
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:37,351
When she saw him, he waved his oar to signal for her to come.

126
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:44,107
She said he was all that was in her mind when she ran.

127
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,832
She said it seemed her feet touched the ground in slow motion as she ran.

128
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:58,795
Then as she was going to reach him, there was the sound of someone screaming behind.

129
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:10,914
My goodness, she said when she came to her senses, she realized that she had fallen on her back.

130
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:14,952
When she fell on her back, she was on her back.

131
00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:20,671
She said she realized as she remembered the kayak and looked over there

132
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:29,378
She said that she fell on her back [?right before] the iceless area. The kayak was gone.

133
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:46,103
Since it was gone, she stood up, after shaking herself to her senses, she look up and saw a person outside their house.

134
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:50,478
That was when she went up.

135
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:58,897
Oh my, she said as she was going up that she remembered the bowls she was holding.

136
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:05,101
"Oh my, I wonder where I put those many bowls I was holding?"

137
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:20,283
Oh my, she said that she didn’t go to that person, but since she say the kayak outside the community house, she thought she’d put them there.

138
00:17:20,683 --> 00:17:26,333
She went them, then that person said to her, "What’s wrong? Where’re you going? Come here."

139
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,790
"Wait, I’m going to check on those bowls."

140
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:39,447
Oh my, she said that she reached the place where she saw the kayak and there was no bowls outside the community house.

141
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:48,916
Oh me, she said she looked around them to see some black things far inland out there.

142
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:57,254
She said that she went to them to find the bowls she was holding, and they had not a scrap in them.

143
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:05,548
Oh my, she said she gathered, and only stopped when they were all there.

144
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:09,854
She said she’d apparently threw them far away.

145
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:15,854
Oh my, she said she went to that person and they brought her in.

146
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:25,704
When she brought them in, when the people of that house brought them in, they had that girl [?check]

147
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:32,942
Why someone ran toward the water without ice.

148
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:44,967
"Because someone on a kayak was waving his oar as a signal to come, she went down."

149
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:56,799
At the time, she said that she would go out to do things, including cut trees because there’s a lot of trees out there.

150
00:18:56,811 --> 00:19:02,811
She said she went out to find cut [branches] already finished.

151
00:19:02,818 --> 00:19:06,180
However, she said she hauled water.

152
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:11,781
Then since they told her to store things into an underground ice cache

153
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:19,006
She said she’d go out and it would be filled with what they asked for.

154
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:30,182
She said it turned out that it was the who’d come to her who’d fill them with what the people of the house asked for before she got them.

155
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:32,976
Oh my.

156
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:46,620
They mentioned that they were going to perform a shamanistic ritual on someone at the community house.

157
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:56,083
She said that when the one called An’arissuun performed the ritual, he talked about it.

158
00:19:56,096 --> 00:20:07,359
"Poor thing, the girls’ bedding truly looks like a vole nest."

159
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:14,271
She said that the path from where that man would appear

160
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:23,496
She said that path was like that on her bedding, that girl’s bedding.

161
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:28,951
Oh my, she said that girl lay down.

162
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:42,214
Then as she stay laying with her eyes clothes, she had her [?], and he appeared through the door.

163
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:49,321
She said it was when they had "doors" of tunnels that you go down.

164
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:57,059
She said that man that used to take care of that girl came.

165
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:16,028
In the community house, the one who was going to perform the shamanistic ritual held a meeting at the community house with two [?] who were brothers.

166
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:26,272
She said that the one who was going to perform the ritual sent a decoy woman.

167
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:32,616
He sent one to the one that would appear to her.

168
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:42,016
And she said that he had a decoy man replace as the one who would appear [to her].

169
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:46,816
He had that decoy man stay around that girl.

170
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:57,710
He did it so that there was no way that man could reach her though he went to her if that decoy man, the doll, replaced him.

171
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:13,360
Like that, you see, our poor grandmother was getting after she had that shamanistic ritual performed on her.

172
00:22:13,385 --> 00:22:20,085
She got better. There was nothing wrong with her anymore.
