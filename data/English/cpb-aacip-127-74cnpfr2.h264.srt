1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:09,950
She passed away when our priest was [?Greens]. A long time.

2
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:19,823
And my wife passed away in the spring around Easter.

3
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:23,190
What was her name?

4
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:27,189
Elena. Elena Andrew.

5
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,961
Hunter?

6
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:31,853
Andrew. (Andrew?) Yes.

7
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:36,238
Yes.

8
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:53,427
First, did you stay in the community house when you were young?

9
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:58,146
Please tell a story about that.

10
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:03,376
When I was young, I grew up in a community house.

11
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:08,878
Then, you know, I would always sleep next to my father in the community house.

12
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:13,060
Among many people, you know, you about the community house.

13
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:19,558
There was one in [?Cuukvagtuli]. Our competitors had a community house.

14
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,975
[I slept] next to my father.

15
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:34,172
Then the sleeping areas above had two feet beds like this in the community house, two feet of wood.

16
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:45,219
Then when it was time, I would go down to the nateq, floor, to the floor planks, you know, the floor.

17
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:48,685
We would sleep without thinking anything of it.

18
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:57,632
We would sleep using these small mittens of ours like this, or those real Yup’ik gloves as headrests.

19
00:01:57,694 --> 00:02:03,039
It wasn’t unusual to us a long time ago, you know?

20
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:09,103
That’s how we lived.

21
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:14,999
My grandfather raised me.

22
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:20,235
He raised me like this: he wouldn’t let me sleep in the morning.

23
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:26,564
It turned out that he had wanted me to live well.

24
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:32,965
Then when I slept like this, he would come wake my up by doing this here.

25
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:42,570
Then when he [?] me from the floor her, he would say, "Quickly go outside."

26
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:51,115
He said that I would get better outside. When I went outside, I would feel better, being awake with no more trace of sleep left.

27
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:58,243
And to this day, I never sleep in the morning [?].

28
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:01,081
I should occassionally speak English.

29
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,912
Yes.

30
00:03:05,277 --> 00:03:07,765
Where was that community house?

31
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:11,355
In Kayalivik. In Kayalivik.

32
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:18,445
Did you have a lot of young companions there in that community house?

33
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:23,441
There were a lot. Young boys would only stay in the community house.

34
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:28,089
In the community house, the youth would stay in the back wall.

35
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:33,953
They would stay in the houses. They wanted the youth to only stay in the community house, you know?

36
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:41,454
These adults and the old men would be here toward the door, across from each other like this.

37
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:45,527
Those would speak to people like this.

38
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:47,813
They would speak to their grandchildren like this.

39
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:55,561
Then after speaking to them, after one addressed and spoke to his grandchild, they would speak sternly. They would be scary when they spoke sternly.

40
00:03:55,623 --> 00:04:00,645
Yet they would always speak about good things.

41
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:04,120
They would instruct the ones inside on the back wall.

42
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:07,339
Yes, that’s how I lived.

43
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,307
They were probably all men in the community house.

44
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:17,968
Yes, yes, only men do that.

45
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,360
And then...

46
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:37,809
Little girls, little girls who had grown would also stay by their fathers in the community house listening to them speak about good things.

47
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:44,189
When some of those did that, they would once in a while.

48
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:49,780
This little girl would keep wanting to be in the community house.

49
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,155
Apparently, she wanted to hear what the men of the community house spoke about.

50
00:04:54,357 --> 00:05:00,435
Yes, what the old men spoke about. Yes, that’s what people would do.

51
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:07,682
What were the adults like in that time?

52
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:20,028
The adults lived only trying to improve boys. They instructed them, telling them to live well.

53
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,941
That’s the only job for adults.

54
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:31,576
They only wanted their relatives, these young boys, to live well.

55
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:37,005
They did want what they said to be lost. The only wanted to be heard.

56
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,631
Those old men I watched would only speak of good things.

57
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:47,300
Yes. Yes, write them down.

58
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:51,999
What...

59
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:07,164
You see, because you’re making me hurry.

60
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:07,831
No.

61
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:15,291
Write them down, and start from the beggining if you are to know them if you are smart.

62
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,909
From the beginning, then you’ll understand.

63
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:23,405
Then those... are we ready?

64
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:30,662
Were those adults like how they are now, or what?

65
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:34,084
No, they weren’t like how they are now.

66
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:42,818
It’s because they don’t go out, and they have no place, because they are not gathered anymore, but scattered in their houses like this.

67
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:55,995
Now, only I speak to the boys, my relatives, or even if they’re not my relatives, who do well [to come] a little about what they need to hear.

68
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:57,243
They listen to them.

69
00:06:57,247 --> 00:07:09,669
And these days, some of the ones who were mischievous whom I spoke to get better right away, are better.

70
00:07:09,873 --> 00:07:17,996
They get clothes, get things, have everything they need, no longer in misfortune.

71
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,985
What would those adults teach the youth?

72
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:31,084
They would teach how they would travel, and how they would travel in the ocean.

73
00:07:31,094 --> 00:07:37,405
They would always speak to them to teach them everything about traveling.

74
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:41,989
That’s what they’d do.

75
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:52,614
They would speak to those we were going to travel like. They even told them what they would do if they came to misfortune in the wilderness. That’s how they [taught] us.

76
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:57,450
Like going to school?

77
00:07:57,465 --> 00:07:59,043
Yes, like going to school.

78
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:04,019
And then because we’re Yup’ik

79
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:17,517
And if we have no other food, if we have something with no other food, if they eat it raw, we must eat it raw.

80
00:08:18,326 --> 00:08:24,193
Then they would instruct us like this:

81
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:35,055
If we’re going to travel, they told us to travel with a little food, a little scrap.

82
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:41,359
And we should always bring a shovel with us.

83
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:43,276
Also some cloth to work with.

84
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:51,203
Since I grew up with an increase of cloth, I always took cloth to work with with me.

85
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:54,673
And always bring fishing tools with us.

86
00:08:55,053 --> 00:09:00,997
Then if the weather turns on us, they told us not to travel right away either.

87
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:05,689
They told us not to travel right away as we think to.

88
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:19,180
Instead, they told us to stop where we’re not shielded [from the wind] liek this, you know, the land like this, the land here.

89
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:27,032
If it hadn’t snowed here, and it was visible like this.

90
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:33,611
They told us to stop like that, and even to set up our tent.

91
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:43,228
Then if we have absolutely no tent, we should hollow out the snow like this.

92
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:47,335
Make a space hollowing it out like this, then go in.

93
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:59,248
But we shouldn’t go into the leeward side in the land here, but hollow out the snow there and go in.

94
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:05,054
And poke a hole above us like this as a breathing hole.

95
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:10,568
You see, I absolutely know that snow is suffocating.

96
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:12,159
Have you ever experienced it?

97
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,025
Yes, I’ve experienced it. It’s suffocating. It’s very hot.

98
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:22,703
A person will suffocate and die if he’s not told about that.

99
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:25,841
It’s suffocating, then he dies.

100
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,513
That snow is dangerous.

101
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:39,032
Also, if you sink, I also experienced sinking to here like this.

102
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:44,614
The weather was calm, and it was cold and chilly like this.

103
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:53,208
I left my wife and children to go hunt, hunting, for minks.

104
00:10:53,369 --> 00:11:01,058
Then this small mink that was acting strangely was dragging

105
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:05,943
It had its forepaws here, and its hindpaws were down there.

106
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:11,474
When I was curious about that, I sank. I followed its tracks.

107
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:14,577
The tundra here was here.

108
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,495
This part was ice.

109
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:23,145
There, I did have a staff, I used my staff.

110
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:30,654
As I was curious about that, when I was going to reach the tundra here, I fell and it reached here.

111
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:34,714
And it was cold out there.

112
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:40,502
And my matches were here, covered in plastic.

113
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:53,091
And I also had long fur boots like this, the ones used for traveling.

114
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:55,321
I sunk.

115
00:11:55,337 --> 00:12:02,914
When I sunk, it didn’t reach past my boods, and I poked where I would go.

116
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:10,788
I would reach the land before [the water] would go here.

117
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:13,289
Then I went on the land.

118
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:18,748
I went up wading. Though I had sunk, I went up on land.

119
00:12:18,783 --> 00:12:25,827
When I went up, I quickly took off my clothes in great hurry because the weather was calm though it was cold.

120
00:12:26,157 --> 00:12:33,568
I quickly wrung them all. I poured the water out of my fur boots and would do this.

121
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:43,112
Then because there was a lot of grass, right when I put on my clothes, I stuffed grass in here.

122
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:47,441
I bunched grass and put them here, put them here.

123
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:53,583
Then when I was done with them, I looked around and noticed pale dry dead wood.

124
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:59,185
Those dry dead wood, you know, the ones we use for woodwork.

125
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:08,159
Then since I had a small kettle before there were a lot of portable stoves, before there were portable stoves

126
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:15,042
I lit the fire with the matches from here that were no longer wet, real mathes.

127
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,445
[?] real matches like this.

128
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:21,619
I started a fire and made a kettle of hot water.

129
00:13:21,622 --> 00:13:26,589
When it got hot, I sipped some tea.

130
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:31,713
When I did, I warmed up. I warmed up from this cold.

131
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,894
Then when I was done, I pondered.

132
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:43,041
Then after I had tea, my legs started getting warmer, the ones that I filled with grass

133
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:47,760
Reaching here and past it.

134
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:57,717
I always used to walk because I didn’t like mushing dogs when I was hunting.

135
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:04,488
Then I tried traveling.

136
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:09,379
Should I’ve gotten cold, I’d have to go home.

137
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:20,877
I walked all day and [my legs] got very warm. I got very hot. I didn’t go quickly.

138
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:30,615
I went to every one of my far away tools, you know, those steel traps, and went home.

139
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:33,565
And I went home in the cold...

140
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:42,806
You see, the instructions of those people back then are old, their first ancestors.

141
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,672
I am living according to the ancestors.

142
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:55,163
Now, we who are trying to be mindful must live according to our ancestors’ wisdom of long ago.

143
00:14:55,446 --> 00:15:00,868
We will live well if we live according to our ancestors like that.

144
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,708
Well, that’s how it is.

145
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,306
Okay, ask me something whenever you want.

146
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:23,039
Some who are elders now, some who are elders now say that a long time ago, elders, people would not get sick. Is that true?

147
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:24,337
Yes, it’s true.

148
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,248
People didn’t get sick back then.

149
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:33,751
Once in a great while, you see, one person would get sick.

150
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:38,975
And sometimes one year would pass.

151
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:45,472
Then sometimes if one is to die, he would be the first to die in a long time.

152
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:52,096
Yet after that had passed, sometimes five years would pass [with no deaths] like that.

153
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:58,987
And there were few who had TB.

154
00:16:00,997 --> 00:16:06,852
They admonish people against getting close to those with TB.

155
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:15,819
Caucasians have started admonishing against this. Though we do this to those with TB, they don’t give it to us.

156
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:25,833
A pesron will not spread his ailment, you know?

157
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:33,918
One who is and thinks like that without being wary will live well, and nothing will touch him.

158
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:35,652
Yes.

159
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:41,146
Nothing will touch him if he’s not wary though they tell him.

160
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:49,342
Now, I am living like that through the instruction passed down to me by my father and grandfather.

161
00:16:53,249 --> 00:17:03,905
Then, a longt ime ago, did the elders have beliefs, and what were their beliefs?

162
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:07,962
Shamans. Only a shaman.

163
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:12,647
And, you know, they didn’t know God, that priest.

164
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:24,181
Back when I was growing up, missions would arrive to Kayalivik where they would compete with Cuukvagtuli.

165
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:32,575
Right away, we would dance back and for like this, back and forth like this, back and forth like this every year, every year too.

166
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,163
They would do that.

167
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:39,966
But what was their belief?

168
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:40,482
What?

169
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:42,843
What was their beleif?

170
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:44,732
The Yup’ik people? (Yes.)

171
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:53,231
Without any belief, they would say this about what they call magic in English:

172
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:55,949
They called it the Spirit of the Universe.

173
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,438
Turned out to be God.

174
00:17:58,088 --> 00:18:02,165
They said they would do that, respecting the Spirit of the Universe.

175
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:06,045
Tuned out to be God.

176
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:11,255
They referred to God as the Spirit of the Universe.

177
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:18,831
Would the people of old speak about the devil?

178
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,450
Yes.

179
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:25,087
The people of old didn’t speak about the devil like that.

180
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:30,262
Yet they would be shamans who called on their spirit helpers, and I would watch.

181
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:38,198
You see, they would do things for some reason, and I wouldn’t know what they did.

182
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:38,868
Did you watch them?

183
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,573
I would watch them.

184
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,367
What would they do?

185
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:46,638
They would do [whatever] they did.

186
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:49,870
When they stopped, they would speak.

187
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,569
They said that they fixed and predicted the weather.

188
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:58,109
They also said they’d instantly go to the moon.

189
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:04,877
You see, people were strange. People were like legendary little people.

190
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:07,332
Yes.

191
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:15,069
Then they would feel a person like this, feeling for his extreme pain.

192
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,170
Then when they let go of him, he got better.

193
00:19:18,745 --> 00:19:23,445
How did those people [do it]? Those people of old are amazing.

194
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:30,480
Would they ask to be paid to do that?

195
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,680
No, they didn’t ask to be paid.

196
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:36,100
But those people who called on spirit helpers

197
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:49,267
When they wanted that person, their relative, to be saved, [they brought] various things, because they didn’t have Western clothes because they only had Yup’ik things

198
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:55,525
Something, including a bearded seal skin, and a young bearded seal skin

199
00:19:55,862 --> 00:20:03,906
Various things, wolverine skin, wolf skin

200
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:09,703
[Giving] something, that’s what those people were like.

201
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:16,953
That was their payment, [?skin] of something.

202
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:21,998
That was their payment. They knew nothing about money.

203
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:32,758
Back when you were young, when you traveled to go hunting, or when you traveled somewhere

204
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:37,651
Did you [experience] anything amazing?
