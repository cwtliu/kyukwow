1
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:13,239
Now, your name, and how old you are.

2
00:00:13,476 --> 00:00:17,188
My name? My English name?

3
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:18,836
In English and Yup’ik.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,889
In Yup’ik, they call me Angukarnaq.

5
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:30,975
And when they don’t call me Angukarnaq, [it’s] Taluar.

6
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:35,413
And when they don’t call me Taluar, [it’s] Allirkar.

7
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:38,460
But I won’t say some of them.

8
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:40,252
What about in English?

9
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:45,930
In English, I have the name Anissum Andrew Jacob.

10
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,953
Please spell Anissum.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,604
A-N-I-S-S-U-M.

12
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:56,877
Do you want paper? Paper’s across there. I have a cabinet across there.

13
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:59,778
It’s okay. We can do it with this.

14
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:01,975
How old are you now?

15
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:04,532
Now, 77.

16
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:07,198
Where were you born?

17
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:10,663
In Iquk, Russian Mission, Yukon [River].

18
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:16,524
When and why did you move here?

19
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:30,236
We moved inland to Akula in the spring, in the winter inland to Akula upriver.

20
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:41,172
Then my dad had a brother, [the] oldest brother.

21
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:49,739
The oldest brother had three children like this, two boys and this girl.

22
00:01:49,747 --> 00:01:54,202
When he was gone, that one married a man from here.

23
00:01:54,548 --> 00:02:05,470
When we came inland to Akula a long time ago for spring camp, that other boy shot himself.

24
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:12,461
The 12 gauge misfired on him. It took this off, taking off the skin, when he [?] like this.

25
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:22,377
We went with him. When we were going home, we came across him.

26
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:28,971
We returned through Kuicaraq to go up north.

27
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:41,965
Then when our father saw him, that boy asked to be brought along, to be brought somewhere.

28
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:47,511
He said that Akiak, there’s a hospital in Akiak.

29
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,183
We brought him there.

30
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:56,116
We’ve been here since then, at least upriver in Ayimqeryaraq, Kalskag. You know it?

31
00:02:56,555 --> 00:02:57,910
There.

32
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:05,864
But I’m not sure when. Maybe 1920-something, ’28 or ’29.

33
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:08,850
We ended up there around then.

34
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:10,562
In the spring.

35
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:16,673
How many children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren if you have any do you have?

36
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,495
I don’t have any of my own.

37
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:29,481
But my sister’s children’s children are my great-grandnephews and great-grandnieces.

38
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:37,875
My daughter Maggie over there has two, [I mean] three adopted kids, two boys.

39
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:44,249
I’m not sure how many great-grandchildren I have.

40
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,616
And I have many grandchildren.

41
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:52,824
And across there are my own grandchildren, over there is Barbara.

42
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:56,000
Barbara and who?

43
00:03:56,662 --> 00:04:12,912
Barbara, Mary, Alexandra, Matthew.

44
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,240
One of the older brothers, look at their older brother up there, drowned last year.

45
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,510
Yes, last year, last year [?].

46
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:34,775
How did you get the idea to make a star?

47
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,100
They didn’t have one here.

48
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:43,725
I made them one like how they celebrate Russian Christmas in Russian Mission to the north.

49
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:51,525
The star, a flag, and this has a ball that is this long.

50
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:55,195
It was very pleasant to spin that.

51
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:05,250
They would call that the star, or what, the light. Up north in Russian mission, they call it a qaltayak.

52
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:10,745
It has a wooden handle, and it round like this.

53
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:15,005
I made one for them here out of plastic.

54
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:17,915
I put a cross above it up there.

55
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:23,355
Now, you see a cross above a flag, right?

56
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,435
Yes, I made one for it like that.

57
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:32,915
Please tell me about that metal star, how you made that star.

58
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:33,555
Who?

59
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:36,785
The metal star you made, metal.

60
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,300
Please tell me about how you made what you made in 1952.

61
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:46,745
I worked on it for a long time.

62
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:53,855
Maybe two, three, two, three weeks I worked on it, maybe two weeks.

63
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:00,920
I was a janitor at the school over there. I’d work on it in the evening when I was done.

64
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,710
I wouldn’t do it all day, except in the evening.

65
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:14,725
And I didn’t have tools, well, before [Western] things came. And we didn’t have electric lights, only traditional lamps.

66
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,810
I’d keep drilling it like this.

67
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:27,605
Did you see it over there? It has poles of something.

68
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:39,280
And those poles, what they’d thrown away when fixing the hospital, I took from the shore upriver and used them for the poles.

69
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:44,185
They’re copper, you know. They’re good.

70
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:52,380
And the star, and the star [was made with a] five gallon can.

71
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:55,725
They had five gallon cans long ago.

72
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,350
You probably don’t know of those.

73
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:07,180
Five gallon can [of] gas, Blazo, kerosene, those things.

74
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,340
They had five gallon containers.

75
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:18,940
I took an empty one of those because it wasn’t rusty and was soft, and cut it into pieces with scissors.

76
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,425
After cutting them, I secured them with a wire.

77
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,580
A small one.

78
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:30,885
I wouldn’t solder them, but tie them.

79
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:32,595
Metal?

80
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,060
Yes.

81
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,440
I’d tie them with wires.

82
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:46,700
I worked on it for a long time. I think I did it for two weeks, you know, because I’d only work on it in the evening when I used to not get tired.

83
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:53,000
Here, downriver, I am from downriver.

84
00:07:53,005 --> 00:08:03,615
Downriver now, there are these: they only have old singers during Russian Christmas.

85
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,905
Here, however, there seems to be more youth like this.

86
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,450
Yes.

87
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:17,470
Do you elders somehow encourage and teach them? Please tell me about that too.

88
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:26,710
Look, these new singers now

89
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:39,925
They can’t sing or follow these old [songs] because they’ve started using songbooks, Western songs.

90
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:45,875
Long ago, however, they never saw those songbooks.

91
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:56,120
Instead, they sang, they sang with their own [memory].

92
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:01,865
Now, however, as you know, you just spoke about the old ones downriver.

93
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:08,075
They sing with what they learned back then, and eventually, they’ve reached this time.

94
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:20,430
Then now, since they use those books, they cannot go along with the old way because that’s new.

95
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:27,030
And they’ve started singing in English. They sang in Yup’ik long ago.

96
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:33,665
During your time back then, when they sang Russian Christmas songs like this

97
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:41,450
How much did you learn when you didn’t use books?

98
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:51,980
We used to sing without books upriver back when I was a little boy going to school in Kalskag.

99
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:59,715
Upriver, one of my former peers, there's one left in Kalskag upriver.

100
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:02,705
And he's old.

101
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,890
Some, however.... all of them have passed away.

102
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:16,235
When you go to Kalskag and ask around, you’ll hear about [?Zakhar] Levi.

103
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:19,675
He’s become a very old man.

104
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:22,565
He was a singer.

105
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:27,605
He was a singer, and was the lead during church.

106
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:35,990
Then now, he’s stopped doing that. Others have instead started, you know, these new boys.

107
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:42,630
He doesn’t read, but he sings. He doesn’t know how to read.

108
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:56,060
Back when you were learning, did you seem more focused than the youth today who are learning songs?

109
00:10:57,945 --> 00:11:04,045
Oh my, I can’t say anything. I don’t know that.

110
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,120
We [practiced to] learn.

111
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,170
We [practiced to] learn how to sing.

112
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:17,165
And we couldn’t read books, but followed the one who was singing.

113
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:22,745
We followed the one singing the song.

114
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,970
Only like that.

115
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:31,800
Now, however, they write. They write, they write.

116
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:35,615
They sing with those books.

117
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:41,545
But long ago when they started using those books with songs

118
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,490
You know there’s a song that goes somehow like this. Do you know them?

119
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,210
They’ve started singing with those now.

120
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,310
I ask one last thing, my last question.

121
00:11:57,495 --> 00:12:00,095
What’s Russian Christmas to you?

122
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,730
To me? I don’t know about Russian Christmas.

123
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:09,345
What’s Russian Christmas to you? What does Russian Christmas to you?

124
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:22,935
Because I went away as a little boy back then, but we used to have Russian Christmas long ago on the Yukon River, up north in Russian Mission.

125
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:32,450
We woud all be boys. We would have Russian Christmas with all boys.

126
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:41,590
Grown people, you know, we had grown ups watching us.

127
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,150
How many, two or one.

128
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,375
We’d have Russian Christmas.

129
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,200
It’s the same as Alussistuaq, Christmas.

130
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:03,515
We’d have Russian Christmas like Christmas.

131
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,540
But we wouldn’t say "Merry Christmas."

132
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,610
And we didn’t say this when we were done: "Merry Christmas."

133
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:14,085
We wouldn’t because we didn’t know it.

134
00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:21,725
[?Prázdniku, prázdniku] only that.

135
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:26,045
And we never heard anyone say, "Merry Christmas."

136
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:36,140
Only when they had Christmas at school did they say, "Merry Christmas."

137
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:44,355
In my earliest memories, I realized that people would go to church at the Russian Orthodox church held only in Russian.

138
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:51,210
Now, they wouldn’t do it in English, and wouldn’t do it in Yup’ik, but only in Russian.

139
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:55,785
And they would read only in Russian.

140
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,620
No English, just Russian.

141
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:02,785
Just those.

142
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,870
And they had a high priest.

143
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:13,215
His reader was the former priest Nicky [?].

144
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:22,200
That high priest would speak in Russian, but Nicky [?] would translate it into Yup’ik.

145
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:28,385
That Nicky [?] was very fluent in Yup’ik.

146
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:31,815
What was he? Was he Yup’ik or what?

147
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:36,685
He was Yup’ik from over there.

148
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,750
I think they refer to Unalaska as Tayarumiut it Yup’ik.

149
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:49,275
He’d apparently been a priest. He came from there.

150
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,595
When he was no longer a priest, he became a reader.

151
00:14:52,610 --> 00:15:01,130
And hewas the high priest’s speaker.

152
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:12,845
Look, if sometime you go to Iquk in the north, Russian Mission, Yukon, Russian Mission

153
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:19,125
Look, up north, there’s one person, Qakngacanrituq.

154
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:27,030
And he’s my senior. He’s maybe two years or three years my senior, that Qakngacanrituq.

155
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:32,695
I know him. I went to school with him when I lived up north in Russian Mission before I left.

156
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:38,390
He will tell you things right, and probably what I don’t know.

157
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:40,335
Okay, thank you.

158
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,390
You’re welcome.

159
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:44,335
Watch, he will tell you if you go there.

160
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,390
Watch, if you go sometime...
