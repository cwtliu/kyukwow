1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
...they say she’s become an old lady.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:08,390
They say they don’t refer to one who can walk by themself as an old man or old woman.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:15,270
But call someon an old man or an old woman...

4
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:23,110
We who know them will not keep our ancestors’ wisdom to ourself

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:28,680
Because they help us stand here on earth for a long time.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,470
Do we want our people whom we love to have early deaths?

7
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:41,835
If we love them, we must tell them especially of our ancestors’ traditional instructions.

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:52,640
Then, we Yupiit have the traditional instruction to warmly welcome all of our fellow people

9
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:56,225
We must cooperate without discriminating against them.

10
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:06,450
Anyone, even the people of Alaska, are asked to stand with one mind in accordance.

11
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:15,145
Some of them here, some religions say this:

12
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:19,840
"Our religion is good and powerful."

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,440
That's not the cast. That's not what it's like.

14
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:32,115
We shouldn't destroy our ancestors' tradition of community, and we shouldn't do away with it.

15
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:39,965
Our ancestors have spoken of this traditional of community, that it's a form of love starting from a long time ago.

16
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:49,480
If we don’t practice love while we’re alive how, what will we do to be saved? We have no other salvation.

17
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,640
Our ancestors practiced love.

18
00:01:52,645 --> 00:02:02,035
And they went in salvation because they practice that will all of their fellow people without discrimination.

19
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:12,575
Though different religions try to have us discriminate against each that, that discrimination is bad and leads to unrest.

20
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:21,625
Only if we practice our ancestors’ instruction of community will we stand [together] in peace

21
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,655
And our faith will be complete.

22
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:28,670
And through that love, we shall be saved.

23
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:36,940
We must have our descendants especially be knowledgeable about our ancestors

24
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,060
And how to take good care of our land.

25
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:49,155
We who know this traditional wisdom shouldn’t hide it.

26
00:02:49,165 --> 00:02:53,065
They say, you see, that our ancestors were like this:

27
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:05,320
They said that in the community house, a young man would be waking up to an old man in the darkness already speaking about a person can live well.

28
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:12,050
The same way in a house out there, they said an old woman would already be speaking.

29
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:20,120
In the darkness, she let those she loved wake up to traditional wisdom and instruction.

30
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,840
Do we do that? We haven't done that.

31
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:34,315
We must keep up what our ancestors were like to our descendants here.

32
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:41,075
We have no other salvation. We only have salvation through community.

33
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:48,980
Jesus came down only to establish community among all the land.

34
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:51,675
Let us know this:

35
00:03:51,675 --> 00:04:05,045
And that sense of community of ours will teach us how to live well, be strong, and live long lives.

36
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:11,035
It’s a great thing how our ancestors stood [together] as a community.

37
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:18,635
That’s why even if they say other religions are better, don’t believe them.

38
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:29,760
One God who has no potential for being exalter higher [among denominations], be greater, or lesser, who is always as he is.

39
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:33,955
We believe in one God and in Jesus

40
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:42,475
To one who cannot be exalted higher [among denominations], be higher, or stronger, who is always as he is.

41
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:53,165
For that reason, let us Yupiit start this sense of community, especially with our descendants.

42
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:57,755
A youth here is like this these days:

43
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:04,420
When [s]he learns to speak English, they become proud thinking they’re smart.

44
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:10,440
And yet [s]he doesn’t know how to survive, and doesn’t know what they will come to.

45
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:22,885
We must make available to our youth and have them be knowledgeable about our ancestors’ way of life

46
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,740
Especially their sense of community.

47
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:33,385
I’ve [come to] say this much though it wasn’t a lot. Thank you.

48
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:29,817
Those people speak little.

49
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:32,997
What’s goin on? Is it time to start? (Yes.)

50
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:39,592
Okay then, let’s talk now.

51
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:46,252
Yes, a long time ago, and when I became observant

52
00:10:46,997 --> 00:10:54,732
We became aware in our early childhood, and we heard about those that my spouse just talked about.

53
00:10:54,732 --> 00:11:01,042
But for us young people, those first Caucasians were scary.

54
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:05,032
We’d occassionally see several Caucasians.

55
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:13,092
Absolutely without [?] them, when they came once in a great while, we’d see Caucasians.

56
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:15,512
There were those.

57
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:23,162
Then one day when we were living here in Anuuraaq, they built a school here.

58
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:27,802
They built a school right in the middle of us, then they started going to school.

59
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:37,307
Then we tried going to school. Our parents didn’t want to part with us.

60
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:41,887
They told us not to go to school whatsoever.

61
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:50,242
They said that it starts something mischievous. Now, they said that those schools make them coddled.

62
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:55,832
They were scary back when we went because they admonished us.

63
00:11:55,832 --> 00:12:02,362
And after I tried going to school, after I tried going to them once...

64
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:05,182
Wait, that fell.

65
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,372
Is he your spouse?

66
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:15,642
It might be because we were too loud.

67
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:16,697
No.

68
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:25,642
Then after we tried going to school, since they told us to stay, we went home.

69
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:33,082
These people kept saying, "These schools are distressing."

70
00:12:33,397 --> 00:12:36,932
Later, their mischief will have bad outcomes.

71
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:42,622
They said they’d become foolish far in the future, not thinking of what chores they should be doing

72
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:47,372
When they start bringing in these mischievous things.

73
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:55,092
We didn’t go to school, but these poor young people and our children started going to school.

74
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:59,237
They started knowing things and wrote for us.

75
00:13:00,382 --> 00:13:06,152
Even those Caucasians... and they didn’t seem to mistreat Caucasians in any way.

76
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:12,132
But the work of those shamans were also like that.

77
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:18,587
They would have fun [causing mischief] with them because they had malicious intent.

78
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:29,537
And among them here, among the many pieces of traditional wisdom from our instructors, one who wanted to [cause mischief] was part of the traditional wisdom.

79
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:32,087
They said that jealousy

80
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:42,177
They said that out of a joulesy of a poor person making their own living, a jealous shaman

81
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:51,462
[S]he places a curse on him to make him unable to catch animals, or destroys the great wealth of one who was going to live well.

82
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:54,367
Those had very malicious intent.

83
00:13:54,752 --> 00:14:01,602
Then these pieces of traditional wisdom

84
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:10,812
They said that among the people around them, though they find us poor young people improper or lazy

85
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:21,167
When I was a girl here, at night, and since I lost my mother at a young age, because I would stop going out at night when it got dark

86
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:29,987
These people would threaten me that if I were a lazy person, that I would be a begger like this.

87
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:40,837
And they said that that [begging] would bring me misfortune after I was lazy when my peers took husbands, out of [my] desire to have things like them.

88
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:50,702
But our thorough instructors would tell us that.

89
00:14:50,707 --> 00:15:03,527
And among our peers, we shouldn’t misbehave, shouldn’t [? as you know], shouldn’t be inadequately observant, shouldn’t be fooling among our peers.

90
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:09,492
When they got up, they’d always tell us

91
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:19,352
"When you young people have children, though your child seems small, or if you admonish them when you put on their boots

92
00:15:19,357 --> 00:15:24,772
"’Now, if your peers do anything to you, respond by getting away from them.’

93
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:26,782
They said the little ones pay attention.

94
00:15:26,782 --> 00:15:36,202
They said that these things our elders heard in their earliest memories are theirs [to remember and pass on].

95
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:48,657
Now, when I remember that, and how I was reluctant to accept that they’d become more mischievous later

96
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:55,602
And since I didn’t speak English, and didn’t hear them speak English, I remembered them.

97
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:59,217
And when we had children, when we got married

98
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:10,587
They told us to treat our spouses with love, take care of our husbands.

99
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:12,737
And we shouldn’t commit adultery.

100
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:20,612
And if we poor woman go to various places without our husbands’ knowledge

101
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:25,952
They said that eventually, we’d become pregnant with someone other than our husbands.

102
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:37,112
Back when in our childhoods, we found that when they instructed us, no matter how socially unacceptable it was, they’d pry it out and tell us.

103
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:43,332
And when they looked at us, we who were listening would think like this:

104
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:48,852
"Oh my, it turns out the one across know knows us, has seen us."

105
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:53,792
It seemed they knew everything about us, like they’d indeed seen us.

106
00:16:54,887 --> 00:17:01,482
It turned out that those who instructed well would empty their heard of what they’d experienced.

107
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:07,662
The dear ones would instruct us, wanting a person to go [through life] well.

108
00:17:07,662 --> 00:17:15,682
And when we bear children, they told us never to bring them to various places [with people].

109
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:22,062
And if we hold their hands to visit other houses with them, the dear ones will become bad.

110
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:30,162
They say their improper behavior exacerbates a mother’s destitution who looks after the home.

111
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:35,322
They said our household’s father would travel to try to provide for us.

112
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:42,742
They said that when he arrives, we women should be thankful for whatever he catches.

113
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:52,937
Or if he earns a little money, we women shouldn’t be angry wanting beautiful dresses or some beautiful shoes.

114
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:58,647
They said it’s because we have nice clothes, because we’re standing with what they provided.

115
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:05,387
They say those will destroy our spouses.

116
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:16,037
What little they obtain, they said we should be dextrous with what little they obtain, helping our dear spouses.

117
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:19,807
They said not to be frivolous with them.

118
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,162
We shouldn’t grab what money he made and go.

119
00:18:23,162 --> 00:18:30,352
And later as we go, if we come across mischievous things, or we drink, or other things

120
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:41,112
They admonished us against all of those dangerous things, not to be like that in front of our children. They said we’d teach them [how to be like that].

121
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:47,327
It turned out that when they got enlisted en masse, and since we have a lot of male children

122
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:53,057
We start living with a hopeless mindset because they [?tended to drink].

123
00:18:53,307 --> 00:19:02,122
May a person live like that without exacerbating anything these days.

124
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:05,762
And their warning of a terrible ending

125
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:13,477
They said that if we start being mischievous, when our parents, instructors, and elders instructed us

126
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:17,972
They said that if we become mischievous, we [won’t] be sensible anymore.

127
00:19:17,972 --> 00:19:27,662
We don’t pay any more attention to our advisor, our instructor, who tells us to live right, without being a hindrance among those around us.

128
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:37,652
Instead, they said that we would do well to look presentable sitting at home, so, they said, that our home would be peaceful.

129
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:47,752
And if some guest who feels helpless comes in, we should make them feel at peace if we don’t, you know, live mischievously.

130
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:58,452
When they said that, though we wanted to [be like that], yet we’d sometimes come across [extrenuating] circumstances.

131
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:03,612
We're unsuccessful when we wanted to be good.

132
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:11,112
And because these people are now in great need of instructors like this

133
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:21,227
These young people, our descendants, because there’s now a lot of people who want to hear traditional instructions

134
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:23,962
That’s why I’m daunted by it.

135
00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:32,972
When we’re grown like this, we’re supposed to listen well to their traditional wisdom.

136
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:43,852
I’ve already started through here on KYUK, with those who are instructing, and those women giving traditional instruction.

137
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:54,367
And those, when women didn’t have husbands, when they didn’t think anything of it, it was their kneeguards.

138
00:20:54,367 --> 00:21:01,737
Through that, we didn’t have children with various [fathers], except through our very own dear husbands.

139
00:21:01,947 --> 00:21:11,002
They said we should have our spouses’ children without adding any from other [people].

140
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:13,852
They said they were very beautiful [families].

141
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:18,852
Poor me, I would wish for that, oh my goodness.

142
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:26,992
Apparently, we might have accidentally gotten pregnant.

143
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:34,132
And the thought of becoming pregnant at a young age was very scary, bringing forth a child.

144
00:21:34,132 --> 00:21:39,642
They said children out of wedlock were very embarrassing. It had been an admonishment.

145
00:21:39,642 --> 00:21:46,102
Apparently, that was how they’d become mischievous as our ancestors talked about.

146
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:50,497
That is an important instruction they have now.

147
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:58,627
These Caucasians are so good. Oh my, they sound nice, these Caucasians are pleasant.

148
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:11,372
When we watch them, and when we watch showsand other things, when they inject rowdy people and women, they’d become very strange.

149
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:17,562
They would become like, and to me, it seemed they had no more rigidity.

150
00:22:17,642 --> 00:22:26,762
If some rowdy person came upon them, it seemed that they wouldn’t have the strength [to apprehend them].

151
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:35,417
Young people, it’ll be good if you don’t do these bad things that are admonished against.

152
00:22:36,347 --> 00:22:40,237
Don’t follow what Caucasians tell you to do too much.

153
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:48,287
Also because they say they start marijuana, and that has negative effects.

154
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:50,102
Don’t abuse those.

155
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,522
But, you see, our lives are short like this.

156
00:22:53,527 --> 00:23:03,522
Our youth and childhood may seem close, yet we become weak, unable to do strenuous things.

157
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:10,522
That’s why you should be careful, not only following those bad things.

158
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:19,202
We will be very thankful if you do housework, make your own living, and try to earn money enthusiastically.

159
00:23:19,202 --> 00:23:27,232
But, use the money you earn for yourselves and your houses to help you, for your things.

160
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:37,632
And now, because I don’t know how to speak English, don’t hold it in high regard since I don’t use it

161
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:50,162
Only when they absolutely want me to, and when my spouse across there comes with me, I take something when he comes with me, because I know nothing of how to buy it.

162
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:56,427
I’m very thankful, I’m thankful that I don’t know because I stay in peace.

163
00:23:56,813 --> 00:24:04,883
Since the ones we watch say little, we’ve probably spoken enough.

164
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:12,983
Should we stop here? Our long talk hasn’t been much.

165
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:14,548
Is that all?

166
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:17,638
I want to stop here.

167
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:33,868
Had we not been mourning, we wouldn’t have [hunted] that animal that was eating.

168
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:37,943
We ate it last, finished it [?].

169
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,323
We eat the meat.

170
00:24:42,843 --> 00:24:47,683
We ate it. We ate that [animal] that had been eating.

171
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:50,408
Since we had no other food, we ate it.

172
00:24:54,213 --> 00:24:58,213
There are many hunting grounds up in the mountains.

173
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:07,798
Here’s the first: Evsairniik is a hunting ground.

174
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:17,803
And next: the hunting grounds at Nacarkiarniar where it takes a long time to climb.

175
00:25:18,178 --> 00:25:24,508
Then the third: Ilutuqacuk. It’s a land under my name.

176
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:26,958
Yes.

177
00:25:29,753 --> 00:25:34,983
And Naqerpak, and Nurtuucaraq.

178
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:38,503
Lots of camps [?] upriver.

179
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,293
And Qanirtuum Qagatii.

180
00:25:41,293 --> 00:25:44,493
Way up there [?].

181
00:25:44,498 --> 00:25:56,768
They call it Nakerpak, the route that goes here to Kuinerram Qagatii.

182
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:07,128
And here on this side of Kuinerram Qagatii, inland from the lake, Equgniilnguq is also a hunting ground.

183
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:14,623
And here at the end near the mouth is another hunting ground, a place where they hunt for a long time.

184
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:22,033
And the people from Kuiggluk go there in the fall until there’s no more men.

185
00:26:22,418 --> 00:26:27,738
They only return when Christmas is nigh.

186
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:39,143
And up there where they call it Naqailnguq, that’s also a hunting ground.

187
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:43,043
They hunt there for a long time.

188
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:56,608
I know all of the hunting grounds up there.

189
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:07,353
Its name is Ingriu͡rluq. The mountain is called Ingriu͡rluq.

190
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:13,453
And downriver from there, it’s called Elngurtuliar.

191
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:16,693
Across from these are Qikertat.

192
00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:27,768
These two inland from Elngurtuliar are called Napanguliik, two boulders standing upright.

193
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:34,873
On the other side of them, there’s what they call Ingrilukaak.

194
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:39,153
And so, those are also hunting grounds.

195
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:49,353
And up there across from that is Iluvaqtuq. They call it Iluvaqtuq. That’s also a hunting ground.

196
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:55,703
Then upriver from there over there, they call it Ulurrugnaq.

197
00:27:55,703 --> 00:28:03,493
The mountain is slanted, slanted towards the water.

198
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:10,093
In the middle is a grassy plain, the grass growing up there.

199
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:18,693
And in the middle of where they grow, the elders say:

200
00:28:18,793 --> 00:28:22,593
They said that a person climbed.

201
00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:31,488
Then, they said that in the middle, he was nervously wary, and squatted beneath himself out of nervous wariness.

202
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:35,268
He couldn’t do anything, couldn’t go.

203
00:28:35,943 --> 00:28:42,643
They said that up there, the center of the mountain is a grassy plain to this day.

204
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:53,858
Then upriver from there, upriver is what they call Atsartulriar, a small mountain that’s not big.

205
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:56,478
It’s also a long time hunting ground.

206
00:28:57,063 --> 00:29:08,983
Then inland from that small mountain is a small river, a small river going inland with the name Kuignayugpak.

207
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:14,528
Now that’s a hunting ground, a long time hunting ground.

208
00:29:15,348 --> 00:29:16,578
And then...

209
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:19,843
[The] Eskimo name is like the mountain here.

210
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:23,393
I’m about to reach Qanirtuq River now.

211
00:29:24,193 --> 00:29:35,023
On the banks of the Qanirtuq River... what was the mountain called again?

212
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:37,303
Ulurrugnaq

213
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:41,473
That’s also a long time hunting ground.

214
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:49,348
And upriver from there... what was it again? Cayagtuli?

215
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:50,848
No?

216
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:57,513
I don’t know them. Is that all?

217
00:29:57,513 --> 00:30:00,763
No, that’s not all. That’s far from all.

218
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:08,960
Then up there, Ircaqurrnaq.

219
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:13,835
That’s also a hunting ground, with the name Ircaqurrnaq.

220
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:22,520
Then here toward the water is a similar mountain with the name Ircaqurrnayagaq.

221
00:30:22,535 --> 00:30:28,195
Then over there upriver from there are Evsairrsugaak.

222
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:35,650
They also hunt not far from there.

223
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:43,030
And here is Qerrirtaq.

224
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:48,265
In Qerrirtaq there, it’s also a hunting ground. You see, it’s a very long standing hunting ground.

225
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:53,415
Then inland is Cingikeggliq.

226
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:59,895
The mountain is named Cingikeggliq with a sharp upward summit.

227
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:07,620
Then on this side, the mountain going down to Kuiggluk is Canirngalria.

228
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:14,525
Then on the other side of that is Qupun. It’s named Qupun.

229
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:21,655
Over there at the end, it’s named Canyon, and Kuignayuggaq.

230
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:29,170
And here on the other side is Nacarkarniarun.

231
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:33,440
Now that’s a long time hunting ground for those who are staying up there.

232
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:39,810
Then on the other side of Nacarkarniarun...

233
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,840
Don’t wave your hands.

234
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,940
Evsairniik. They call them Evsairniik.

235
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:51,135
Those are also a hunting ground for a long time.

236
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:57,765
He’s tired.

237
00:31:57,765 --> 00:32:02,555
Yeah, so you can take a break, rest, stop for a minute. Yeah, stop.

238
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:03,695
Yes, you’re tired.

239
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,470
I spoke about all of those hunting grounds.

240
00:32:08,475 --> 00:32:10,625
I don’t know how to [?] English.

241
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:19,655
Has he mentioned any stories of big creatures?

242
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:21,475
It has big fish.

243
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:23,895
Yes, he just talked about it. She already [did].

244
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:32,750
Did he talk about, anything about the skeleton, ribs, skeletons on the beach?

245
00:32:32,755 --> 00:32:34,050
It’s [been a] long time.

246
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:39,150
Yeah, did he talk about that though? (Yes.) The skeletons on the beach? (Yes.)

247
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:48,190
[?] the father, her father, long time, the bones, [?back] bones?

248
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,660
Yeah, yeah.

249
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,740
She get big hole on it.

250
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:52,855
Right.

251
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:55,085
In and out, the kids are playing.

252
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:57,340
Yeah, that’s what I heard.

253
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,350
Yes.

254
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:06,850
She’s at long grass, that place on ground, place, that old place.

255
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,880
Do you know which side of the lake those were on? North side?

256
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,130
No. (South side?) Kwethluk side.

257
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,600
Kwethluk side of the lake?

258
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,060
That’s east side?

259
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:17,875
No.

260
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:18,745
South?

261
00:33:18,745 --> 00:33:19,415
Yes.

262
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,570
Facing this way like this, yes.

263
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,790
Kiillaraliin, Heart Lake, Kwethluk, this side.

264
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,925
This side, that’s where the bones were?

265
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:28,635
Yes.

266
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:32,505
Yes. Where’s your map? I’ll show you.

267
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:33,800
Where’s your map?

268
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,530
Okay, Jerry can you get that? It’s back in there, top one.

269
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:47,170
On the next map, you know how it goes toward Kwethluk like this?

270
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,710
Right or left? Right?

271
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,660
Where’s Kwethluk?

272
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,780
Look, here’s Kwethluk.

273
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,460
Yes, it’s this side.

274
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,540
We always stay [on] this side.

275
00:34:13,325 --> 00:34:15,055
Kuikayuk is over there.

276
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:16,295
Can you say this aloud?

277
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:17,765
Here’s Kuikayuk.

278
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:21,755
Yes. Crooked Creek Mountain, yes, here it is.

279
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:35,465
Where’s Kiillaraliin? Here it is.

280
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:41,295
(Kiillaraliin is on this side.) Here’s Keligceńaq.

281
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,470
Upper Fall, Igceńaq, Qurrlurtaq.

282
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,360
Yes.

283
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,350
Eskimo name, Qurrlurtaq.

284
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,690
Here’s Taryaqvagtuli.

285
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:59,070
[?] here.

286
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:04,370
Down there on this side. It’s on this side.

287
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,770
It’s on this side there.

288
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,410
[?]

289
00:35:09,415 --> 00:35:12,915
Evon Qugg’aq [?].

290
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,190
You know stories, or?

291
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,840
No, it’s older than [?].

292
00:35:25,015 --> 00:35:33,315
She’s teaching for hunting, walking. No stove, just tent in winter.

293
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,350
When you went to Heart Lake, did you walk?

294
00:35:39,355 --> 00:35:41,670
No, by plane.

295
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,610
This time? Long time ago, though, you walked?

296
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:47,370
Dogs.

297
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,270
Dogs.

298
00:35:48,945 --> 00:35:50,205
Dog team.

299
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,040
Do you went to Heart Lake in the winter?

300
00:35:53,995 --> 00:35:58,215
Spring. (In the spring toward the fall?) Beaver hunting that time.

301
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:07,430
Now is, it was in the fall instead this year.

302
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:12,720
How many years, since long time. Her daughter went up too.

303
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,120
I didn’t go up because I’m sickly.

304
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,490
They flew up this year?

305
00:36:21,615 --> 00:36:23,575
I’m getting old.

306
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:35,940
Is the lake, the lake’s good now? There’s no big fish in the lake? It’s good? No...

307
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:42,430
She got lots of talaarit [rainbow trout]. [?] What are talaarit again?

308
00:36:47,345 --> 00:36:50,215
What do they call those fish again?

309
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,650
(Who?) Talaarit. (Who?) Trout in the lakes.

310
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,040
Lake trout.

311
00:36:59,045 --> 00:37:01,455
Small ones. (Yes.) We’re fishing. (Yes.)

312
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:02,525
Lake trout.

313
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:04,895
[?] small one.

314
00:37:04,895 --> 00:37:07,805
But no creatures in there, like, no stories anymore?

315
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:13,665
Sometime, her youngest brother... but we’re from mountainside.

316
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,080
He saw the something bubbling the water.

317
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,630
And then he saw lots of spots.

318
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:29,210
Down, way down, it’s clear. You know the clear water?

319
00:37:29,215 --> 00:37:30,390
Clear water?

320
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:35,290
Yes, way down there, he saw the spots, [?black].

321
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,435
When was that?

322
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,600
Almost jump up.

323
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:41,265
This time? This trip?

324
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:42,475
No, long time.

325
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:43,150
Oh, long time?

326
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:50,090
Her brother, when she was like... she’s in hospital now.

327
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:55,875
So, did people get scared and stop going there, or people always went there?

328
00:37:56,225 --> 00:38:00,075
But me, I’m scared I might eat airplane.

329
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:09,965
Really, I’m scared we might eat.

330
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:22,850
You ever, you or Wassilie ever hear of a stone face on top of a mountain by Kiseralik?

331
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,260
Stone head, face?

332
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:28,250
No, I never go Kiillaraliin.

333
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:35,500
Can you ask him? A stone head by Kiseralik, does he know? Can you ask?

334
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,980
What head?

335
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,260
Stone, rock, on top of a mountain.

336
00:38:40,265 --> 00:38:43,375
You never heard, huh? (I don’t know. I don’t know it.)

337
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:48,875
Did you know a Old Man Reed that a mine up on the Kiseralik?

338
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,380
No.

339
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:54,000
I always went up [?], always [?] ’cause I would...

340
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,420
Only went up to...

341
00:38:55,425 --> 00:38:56,985
’Cause I would, yeah.

342
00:38:56,987 --> 00:39:01,657
One time, he went up to Kiillaraliin, but always raining.

343
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:08,217
Summer stories we’ve had, the people go up to Kiseralik all the time, but they were afraid to go to Heart Lake

344
00:39:08,742 --> 00:39:14,412
’Cause there’s supposed to be a creature over there, so they never did go to Kiseralik, I mean, to Heart Lake.

345
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:18,062
We talked to Fanny, Fanny.

346
00:39:18,062 --> 00:39:19,612
Yes. (Yes.)

347
00:39:19,612 --> 00:39:29,932
When she was young, her brother, David Jackson, long time, she went up that way.

348
00:39:31,157 --> 00:39:34,457
Look, I’ll show you Kiillaraliin Lake.

349
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:46,662
Where?

350
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:47,777
In Bethel.

351
00:39:48,527 --> 00:39:50,322
I heard about them recently.

352
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:53,342
(I don’t understand them, you see.) Yes, I don’t understand them.

353
00:39:53,347 --> 00:39:54,487
Yes.

354
00:39:58,082 --> 00:40:00,632
We’ve probably started rolling now.

355
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,382
Wait.

356
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:17,382
William, please quickly say where you were born, and how old you are now.

357
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:23,552
Okay, I was born in 1915 long ago

358
00:40:23,782 --> 00:40:31,532
When the Kuskokwim here was peaceful, and people traveled by rowing.

359
00:40:31,822 --> 00:40:35,732
And they’d row to go fishing. There were no boat motors.

360
00:40:36,492 --> 00:40:42,172
How old are you now as you remember it, as you know it?

361
00:40:42,177 --> 00:40:44,767
I think I’m 75.

362
00:40:46,387 --> 00:40:48,657
Also say your name in Yup’ik.

363
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:49,952
Callerkuaq.

364
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:51,552
Callerkuaq? (Yes.)

365
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:52,467
I see.

366
00:40:53,542 --> 00:41:02,522
Also, please tell us about your first job when you were young.

367
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:09,637
I was part of the Elders of the church. I was a preacher in church.

368
00:41:10,057 --> 00:41:16,197
And to the young people, I was a leader for the Young People.

369
00:41:17,092 --> 00:41:26,892
And after that, I went into the could, IRA Council, back around ’43.

370
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:33,817
And from then on, I never stopped working with the tribal council regulations.

371
00:41:34,082 --> 00:41:44,782
And as we Yupiit live here, I especially know that traditional instruction too.

372
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:50,007
And these too... I wasn’t a student.

373
00:41:50,562 --> 00:41:59,792
And the federal government, the Territory of Alaska, I also observed its laws.

374
00:42:00,702 --> 00:42:09,422
And I would study those by watching those who knew the laws.

375
00:42:11,507 --> 00:42:19,817
These days, about the problem of us Yupiit, alcohol

376
00:42:21,627 --> 00:42:29,762
What it was like back then, it’s still closed now in Bethel or in villages.

377
00:42:29,762 --> 00:42:35,632
Please talk about what it was like, and how it’s different today.

378
00:42:35,632 --> 00:42:42,842
In 1930, I first heard about someone having an accident in the water.

379
00:42:43,892 --> 00:42:47,632
And I saw that alcohol had gotten him.

380
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:55,127
Then after that, I also heard about someone who shot himself under the influence of alcohol.

381
00:42:55,667 --> 00:43:00,082
It was long after. I think it was a year after.

382
00:43:00,082 --> 00:43:11,932
Also, for a long time after that, I also heard about a person who was missing in the spring when the ice broke up.

383
00:43:11,932 --> 00:43:18,582
And when they found him in the summer, we went downriver to go see him.

384
00:43:18,742 --> 00:43:22,442
Those were the first victims of alcohol.

385
00:43:22,787 --> 00:43:28,222
Then from here on out to now, it happens a lot.

386
00:43:28,222 --> 00:43:31,822
These boys are [dying] at a very fast rate.

387
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:37,997
And when it was open, it really was like they were dropping rapidly.

388
00:43:38,797 --> 00:43:45,687
Especially now, it’s especially awful in our current day.

389
00:43:46,907 --> 00:43:57,577
Sometimes, I sleep in fear because these young people are distressing.

390
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:11,457
What can you instruct us about that, and how we can help someone with that addiction?

391
00:44:12,057 --> 00:44:19,227
For those with that problem, addiction, they say this is the first: love.

392
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:25,712
And even if they heavily abuse it, don’t condemn them.

393
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:34,222
Instead, treat them no different with the love of our ancient way of life, our ancestors’ tradition.

394
00:44:34,962 --> 00:44:39,512
It turns out, we can’t completely eradicate that as we live.

395
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:45,822
Some think that people won’t socialize with them.

396
00:44:46,412 --> 00:44:55,412
We must also talk to them like this about their lives’, you know, traditional wisdom.

397
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:07,502
Now, when someone with an addiction says this: "I want to quit. I don’t want to drink anymore,"

398
00:45:07,502 --> 00:45:13,572
Some of us answer them like this: "I do admonish you. You don’t listen."

399
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:21,882
How would you, how would you instruct us to answer that person who is eager [to quit] like that?

400
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:29,242
One who is eager [to quit] like that must believe what I said.

401
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:38,722
Sometimes, I see someone who truly does end up quitting.

402
00:45:40,627 --> 00:45:46,877
But now, some can’t quit.

403
00:45:46,907 --> 00:45:57,107
I work with alcohol [addiction] through the tribal court. Sometimes, there are nine boys.

404
00:45:58,032 --> 00:46:02,072
But we work with them through our court.

405
00:46:02,787 --> 00:46:05,797
It’s very good. l like it.

406
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:12,702
But also, those small students who are this big

407
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:22,512
I can bring them in together there without any sentence, but talk to them as was our ancestors’ custom.

408
00:46:22,652 --> 00:46:27,482
But these, an older one at 20 years, who’s 20 years old

409
00:46:27,772 --> 00:46:36,982
To me, I cannot work with him as those children there in our Yup’ik court.

410
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:46,662
But we will not ignore one who needs that, but bring them downriver if we’re wary.

411
00:46:47,782 --> 00:46:54,932
Now, I can speak about what I know and what I’ve experienced.

412
00:46:56,092 --> 00:47:05,102
You just said that you tell the children or young people about the traditional wisdom that you used to hear.

413
00:47:05,102 --> 00:47:10,192
Please bring forth that traditional wisdom you used to hear.

414
00:47:10,192 --> 00:47:20,602
This, this is what it’s like: "My son, obey your father and mother. Obey them, so that you will live."

415
00:47:21,192 --> 00:47:26,802
That’s traditional wisdom for those [children] who aren’t big.

416
00:47:27,692 --> 00:47:37,972
Also tell them this: when the time to go to bed has come for them to go home right away.

417
00:47:38,557 --> 00:47:44,707
They say that after midnight, in our way of life

418
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:52,097
They say that after midnight, a person’s behavior splits.

419
00:47:53,647 --> 00:47:59,097
Their mind will get an idea, [s]he will go into a house.

420
00:48:00,197 --> 00:48:04,807
[S]he will have nothing [but mischief] to do after midnight.

421
00:48:04,807 --> 00:48:10,347
That’s something that our ancestors also spoke of.

422
00:48:12,342 --> 00:48:18,362
Any other important thing that you want to say

423
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:28,757
It may be traditional instruction, an admonishment, or from our Yup’ik culture, the culture of [our] people long ago.

424
00:48:28,957 --> 00:48:33,337
Please speak about it now. Say what you want.

425
00:48:33,892 --> 00:48:43,252
Back in our ancestors’ culture, there was nothing except for the community house.

426
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:48,167
They would instruct us there in the community house.

427
00:48:48,182 --> 00:48:54,882
But also, when I’d go into a house, I’d stand back at the door.

428
00:48:55,467 --> 00:49:03,557
Someone from here would say, "Dear one back there," calling me by an endearing term.

429
00:49:03,987 --> 00:49:11,357
And from the handle at the exit, we couldn’t step anywhere or run out.

430
00:49:12,247 --> 00:49:18,217
Now, I don’t come across anyone giving instruction anymore.

431
00:49:18,927 --> 00:49:25,487
In our current day, I don’t come across that anymore.

432
00:49:26,937 --> 00:49:29,237
Why is that the case?

433
00:49:30,172 --> 00:49:33,702
It’s an ancient traditional from long ago.

434
00:49:33,802 --> 00:49:38,452
Like this, our traditional Yup’ik instructions

435
00:49:38,762 --> 00:49:48,952
Even over a hundred years, it doesn’t change, and doesn’t sow discord.

436
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:56,052
Instead, you can speak of peace, you can admonish a person to be peaceful.

437
00:49:57,112 --> 00:50:07,282
Also, villages like this, small villages would have leaders, one elder who was an advisor.

438
00:50:07,282 --> 00:50:10,132
[S]he was like a great leader.

439
00:50:11,162 --> 00:50:22,402
Every village, I used to see them back then including downriver in Napaskiak, these villages, even what they call Ayalpiit downriver.

440
00:50:24,197 --> 00:50:33,972
You also just said that young people don’t hear traditional wisdom anymore, that these people don’t [instruct them] anymore.

441
00:50:33,972 --> 00:50:37,042
Why is that the case?

442
00:50:37,472 --> 00:50:50,882
Since’ it’s like that, this state is going to take over us, superceding us like this.

443
00:50:52,732 --> 00:50:59,252
We started this, what is called the Yup’ik Nation.

444
00:50:59,297 --> 00:51:02,467
I call it the Ancient Way of Life.

445
00:51:02,857 --> 00:51:12,417
I can say what I just said, "Obey your father and mother. And quit living according to your every whim."

446
00:51:12,592 --> 00:51:20,172
Now, it’s becoming stronger and better to me downriver in Akiachak.

447
00:51:20,397 --> 00:51:23,177
It was almost lost.

448
00:51:23,522 --> 00:51:30,932
Then Willie who is a boy, I’m not sure how far apart you are, probably the same age as you.

449
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:41,632
We’ve [gone over] our language and traditional instructions with his peerson, his peers are also in my council.

450
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:46,167
In my mind, I don’t worry about them now.

451
00:51:46,797 --> 00:51:55,107
But I still haven’t taught them about the stars and winds for survival.

452
00:51:55,427 --> 00:52:01,397
Much of how to survival has still not been brought up.

453
00:52:05,397 --> 00:52:12,777
You’ve made me curious about survival with the stars and winds. Please talk about it.

454
00:52:12,777 --> 00:52:17,787
I know about [these] four winds very well. They are the harbingers of fish.

455
00:52:19,037 --> 00:52:25,307
I know when the fish are coming int he summer through these because I would always fish.

456
00:52:25,697 --> 00:52:29,057
And I know if they’re going to be abundant.

457
00:52:29,432 --> 00:52:36,622
One wind direction heralds no fish: the one they call [?kanavaq].

458
00:52:37,502 --> 00:52:40,572
You may fish, but they won’t bite.

459
00:52:41,672 --> 00:52:43,362
Those are [the winds].

460
00:52:43,362 --> 00:52:46,272
You must also observe the stars up there.

461
00:52:46,272 --> 00:52:53,722
Up in the middle of the sky, there are seven rotating stars to measure time.

462
00:52:54,212 --> 00:53:04,512
When these seven rotate like this, if it faces the day[break] over there, if it stops and faces it

463
00:53:06,107 --> 00:53:13,437
A star will rise, the only biggest and bright one, pulling up Erenret [Days - constellation?].

464
00:53:13,437 --> 00:53:16,477
Then when it ends, Erenret appear.

465
00:53:16,922 --> 00:53:20,752
That was when our ancestors would start stirring.

466
00:53:21,012 --> 00:53:26,592
They said it was time [to get up] now. Also, it was because they had no clocks, wouldn’t see clocks.

467
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:35,507
Also, if there are a lot like this, it will be windy. They are connected to the wind.

468
00:53:35,682 --> 00:53:42,982
And even if it’s windy from that direction, if the star goes past and there’s a falling star, the wind will shift to there.

469
00:53:43,297 --> 00:53:50,307
These people they call scientists who are knowledgeable about fish.

470
00:53:51,157 --> 00:53:58,377
Though we didn’t have those, we are knowledgeable about them. Since I always fished, I know them.

471
00:53:58,612 --> 00:54:07,802
And I also know the ones who’ve stayed downriver in the currents. They are easy to tell.

472
00:54:07,982 --> 00:54:13,352
Those are things I was taught, what I learned.

473
00:54:14,262 --> 00:54:20,462
Also, when there kept being strong winds int he spring, they said it brought fish.

474
00:54:21,337 --> 00:54:22,617
How was that?

475
00:54:22,902 --> 00:54:30,952
Those were things they observed back then. It’s good to observe the world, our world.

476
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:38,402
Okay, if you want to say anything else, or if you have nothing left to say...

477
00:54:38,402 --> 00:54:48,172
I’m very thankful now. I yearn to join you like this to speak about our ancient traditions.

478
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:55,642
And that guy, you know, who is he again? Twitchell.

479
00:54:56,057 --> 00:55:00,347
He wanted to record me, but since I didn’t go downriver, he didn’t.

480
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:03,187
Willie...

481
00:55:10,347 --> 00:55:14,447
Willie, what’s your view on the unification issue?

482
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:26,492
The unification issue has been a topic of discussion on AVCP’s convention, I would guess for the last four to five years.

483
00:55:28,112 --> 00:55:40,172
I think it has made a slow progress, but nevertheless, it takes time to work on issues of relevance that affect the whole region.

484
00:55:40,927 --> 00:55:52,767
Just recently, prior to the convention, we had what we call a Unification Forum Meeting in Emmonak where the regional non-profits were invited.

485
00:55:53,162 --> 00:56:06,722
And at that time, we discussed with Nunam Kellutestii, Ceńaliulriit, YKHC, AVCP, and Yupiit Nation

486
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:19,320
About the unification process that AVCP has undertaken based up the directions that they received from Kipnuk’s convention resolution.

487
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:33,690
At that time, we also understand that not many of the people in the villages really understood what the unification meant.

488
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:40,360
The unification that we’re talking about is the development of the regional tribal government.

489
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:48,250
So at the recommendations at the Emmonak forum meeting was that

490
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:55,110
The non-profits each shall adopt a supporting resolution in concept.

491
00:56:55,300 --> 00:57:00,540
And we did receive commitment from the organizations that were represented there.

492
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:11,900
I believe one of the things that this convention will talk about, how to select people to sit on what it’s called, the Constitutional Committee.

493
00:57:12,687 --> 00:57:28,662
The Constitutional Committee’s task would be to review how the other Indigenous people in the United States, for that matter the whole world, organize under their own types of government.

494
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:36,260
As stated, as I stated earlier, not everybody understands the tribal government issues.

495
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:41,520
So, one of the tasks of this committee would be to educate the people.

496
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:47,550
By that, I mean they will be traveling to regional centers to conduct series of public meetings

497
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:56,020
To get people to understand and up to speed of what we would like to achieve under the unification plan.

498
00:57:56,464 --> 00:58:00,285
I think one important thing about the unificationplan is

499
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:09,721
That the organizations and their boards are not the individuals and the authority to develop this government.

500
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:18,850
Ultimately, the people in the villages, those that have the voting rights will be the ones to vote on the issue

501
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:24,000
And then proceed with the development of a government.

502
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:31,057
You think you’re going to see lot of support after this unification forum?

503
00:58:31,064 --> 00:58:35,349
I believe so, based on some of the comments that I heard.

504
00:58:35,357 --> 00:58:40,879
There’s still a lot of questions that needs to be brought out and answered

505
00:58:40,886 --> 00:58:47,007
And we had a little bit of taste of that yesterday when I gave the Yupiit Nation report.

506
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:54,050
I think especially the elders have already understood the concept

507
00:58:54,386 --> 00:58:59,064
But it’s, from some of the comments that I’ve heard from the elders is that

508
00:58:59,393 --> 00:59:07,107
These young people that are bilingual aren’t too sure whether to go with the old ways or the new ways.

509
00:59:07,114 --> 00:59:12,779
I think in developing a regional government under the unification process

510
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:17,657
Both the old ways and the new ways needs to be incorporated

511
00:59:17,664 --> 00:59:24,228
So that whatever comes about would best represent the people, and work for the people.

512
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,707
One other question...

513
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:31,100
Even if you don’t prepare? is it ready?

514
00:59:31,729 --> 00:59:38,336
I don’t think AVCP is boycotting not to rejoin AFN

515
00:59:38,564 --> 00:59:40,592
And, it’s on the agenda.

516
00:59:41,422 --> 00:59:50,514
I think what AVCP wants is true representation of our desires

517
00:59:50,679 --> 00:59:54,179
If we are to go back to AFN.

518
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:58,793
And, I think using the example of the 1991 process

519
00:59:59,493 --> 01:00:05,814
AVCP had some specific issues that we wanted AFN to address.

520
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:11,786
But, on the 11th hour, our concerns weren’t heard.

521
01:00:11,872 --> 01:00:19,236
And for that reason, we did not go back to AFN, among others.

522
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:21,521
That was the primary reason.

523
01:00:21,528 --> 01:00:27,000
If AVCP is to rejoin AFN

524
01:00:27,107 --> 01:00:31,314
The AVCP leadership needs to sit down with AFN leadership

525
01:00:31,343 --> 01:00:36,850
And discuss how representation would have to occur.

526
01:00:36,857 --> 01:00:43,250
And, AVCP needs to be involved in such a statewide organization.

527
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:47,164
Do you have any additional comments you want to make?

528
01:00:48,886 --> 01:00:55,436
I guess as far as the convention here, the 25th Annual Convention of AVCP

529
01:00:55,721 --> 01:01:03,507
This, I view as a turning point where our people are beginning to understand

530
01:01:03,514 --> 01:01:08,414
That we need to work together as a united group of villages.

531
01:01:08,921 --> 01:01:18,350
Whatever form the unification comes out of, we need to support it individually and organizationally in order for it to succeed

532
01:01:18,357 --> 01:01:20,507
For our desires.

533
01:01:20,936 --> 01:01:21,850
Thank you.

534
01:01:21,857 --> 01:01:22,729
Thank you.

535
01:01:22,735 --> 01:01:24,278
You should’ve spoke Yup’ik.

536
01:01:24,286 --> 01:01:25,986
It’s okay, [s]he just covered it.
