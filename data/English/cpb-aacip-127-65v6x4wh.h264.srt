1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
One Caucasian was watching them.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,050
When they were struggling, he told them to get off.

3
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:24,235
After placing a rope across like this, he twisted a piece of wood, twisting like this.

4
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:30,755
He strung them around through the many people’s [?struggles] but came short.

5
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,640
That Caucasian clamped them with hide.

6
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:51,940
That was back when Yupiit didn’t have clamps or nails.

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,910
What is it?

8
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:05,160
Well, my age... (How old are you now?)

9
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,640
I am not very old.

10
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:19,885
I asked Johnny Samuelson, Cakayak, his age, saying that I don’t know about counting years.

11
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:29,850
Then when he said his age, I said to him, "Then let me be that age too."

12
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:39,450
I can’t tell you how old I am.

13
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,470
So, where were you born?

14
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:47,485
They said I was born over in Kwethluk, in Ceńaqliit [Shore/Riverbank].

15
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,060
And I grew up in Kipnuk.

16
00:01:52,940 --> 00:02:04,100
And when I had fallen in love with a young lade across there, I went to her in Anuuraaq and married her, my wife across there.

17
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:12,335
As you are a young lady, she had a pretty face like you

18
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,680
Also because she hand handmade Yup’ik earrings.

19
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:29,395
Should we move on to Yup’ik things? (Yaa.)

20
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:41,130
Okay, let me tell a story about what my instructor taught me about Yup’ik instructions.

21
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,140
I’ve become disinclined to speak for too long.

22
00:02:50,005 --> 00:03:01,775
When I was growing up, they would tell me to try to live life with an alert and wise mind.

23
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:15,145
Then when I had grown and started traveling and going with them on sleds, they would tell me this:

24
00:03:16,345 --> 00:03:27,195
They said that when I am able, and I start catching animals from the wilderness and down from the ocean

25
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:41,745
If I hold on to this one hide, there will be more, until eventually I have a kayak.

26
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:50,280
Then they said that if I catch a mink or muskrat in the wilderness inland

27
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,740
They said that if I hold on to the other side without immediately giving it away

28
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:05,975
They said that if I have a little bit and there is more later, it will be good if I give it them.

29
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:12,495
You see, I desired these shoes

30
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:22,970
These Western shoes, and these pants that are pre-made out of fabric.

31
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:37,675
When the fathers of my fellow boys returned after going to the city, they would have shoes, and fabric pants [?].

32
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:46,695
I would be barefoot, and would not wear pants in the summer at fish camp because I didn’t have any.

33
00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:58,355
Though I would go to bed, I would not be sleepy because I desired what they had.

34
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,210
Now, [my wife] across there used to make me skin boots.

35
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:12,725
I’ve started rejecting them because their soles are too slippery on snow.

36
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:15,355
They get holes too.

37
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:18,625
I respond to her like this:

38
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:31,635
"Because I coveted these shoes too much, wanting them too, I try to use these shoes."

39
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:44,825
And after one of the women who instructed me watched me, she would [?say] to me:

40
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:58,535
"If you are mindless, if you are mindless, you will go forward coveting your peers

41
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,990
"Though your peers take what they need."

42
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:14,615
Since I was mindless, I coveted my peers though they took [what they needed].

43
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:25,640
But, you see, I feel especially displeased with one of my children.

44
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:38,460
Apparently, he’s not saving what money he gets through checks.

45
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:46,960
If he saves what money he gets through even small checks

46
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:53,980
When they accumulate, he’d be bale to pay for a snow machine.

47
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:02,490
And he’d be able to pay for a boat motor.

48
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,645
It’s no wonder they tell us

49
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:17,315
They said that passing money by, immediately passing money by to whatever is in the stores

50
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:27,910
If we follow our minds whims on whatever we want and pass money by on those, we will not have [important] things.

51
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:35,135
They said we wouldn’t get an expensive boat, or an expensive motor.

52
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:44,270
They also said that if we abuse alcohol, we will not have expensive clothes.

53
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,230
They said it’s because we use those for mischief, what we would trade for what we need.

54
00:07:52,045 --> 00:08:00,255
Now that I’m an old man, I’m seeing that traditional wisdom that was passed down to us.

55
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:06,205
The people back then evidently did not give baseless instruction.

56
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:16,420
Instead, they instruct us on things they’ve experiences, what they’ve experienced before us.

57
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:27,455
And some didn’t keep their mistakes to themselves, but admonished us against committing their mistakes.

58
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:38,135
When I listen to Min’garalris here in the steam houses, he says

59
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:50,630
He said that he watched a man when he was a boy, Min’garalria is from Qinaq, someone they called Aassitugaq.

60
00:08:51,475 --> 00:09:00,455
His wife was Marayill’er, and their sons were Nasquna’ar, Panigassa’ar, and Ayimquutaq.

61
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:12,800
He said that that man he watched was not lucky in hunts, and he wouldn’t catch a lot down in the ocean.

62
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,160
Instead, he said that he would be in landlacked places. He lived on the land.

63
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:31,835
He said that every year for a long time, he would keep muskrats, minks, and other fur-bearing animals.

64
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:42,755
However, he said that he always had a boat, and always had a kayak made of seal skin, and those seal skin boats.

65
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:45,110
He said he always had a boat.

66
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:56,100
He said that because he kept whatever he caught, he would sell them for boats and sell them for kayaks when he had enough.

67
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:11,390
They would tell us, ’Back when a married couple made their own living when there were no Caucasians, if he finished their fathers small sled

68
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:21,405
"And if he finishes a wooden shoever, and holds on to a small axe, and an ice chisel

69
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:31,350
"They will be able to have things, even if that family’s poor father is poor."

70
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:41,525
He also said that if he keeps that fishing dipnet that catches sticklebacks

71
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:47,935
And he said that if he makes fish traps out of straight-grained pieces of wood that catch fish

72
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:55,500
And if he sets fishtrap-like traps to catch minks

73
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:02,965
He said that even if he’s poor, if he acts as a rich father of a family

74
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:13,095
If he gives his children an abundance of things, even if they have ragged clothes, he will take care of them until they are strong enough [to do so by themseles] in the future.

75
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,590
This is the traditional wisdom passed down to us before Western contact.

76
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:29,730
I also used to see people who were as poor as we were.

77
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:42,300
People who have male children and have little mistakenly believe that they are poor.

78
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:57,365
When their sons started hunting and trapping fur bearing animals, their fathers would suddenly become rich when fur was expensive.

79
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:10,685
Also, when they start bringing in animals down from the ocean, we forget that they are poor, and instead want to be like them.

80
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:24,650
When they have fathers who take care of them well, and they do not pass by what they had caught, but instead sell them.

81
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:35,730
And then they would say, "There may be five brothers in this family who are great hunters

82
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:44,125
"And this married couple may only have one son

83
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:55,155
"If the couple’s son wishes to be like those five brothers who are great hunters and is not lazy

84
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:05,640
"If he competes without their knowledge by subsisting, he will become as great as those five great hunters."

85
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:15,790
They say that it’s easy to compete against great hunters without their knowledge. They say that brothers argue.

86
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:24,795
"Tell him to fish with a drift net." "I don’t want to fish with a gill net." "Tell him to gather wood." "I don’t want to gather wood."

87
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,080
This is what they mean about how it’s easy.

88
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:35,760
They say that even one person can compete with them on their level.

89
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:43,450
These are what we were told in our early childhoods when there were no Caucasians.

90
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:56,380
And these young ladies who were not married, as they got older, they gave them a lot of instructions and admonishments.

91
00:13:57,525 --> 00:14:08,795
And they would admonish them against ever meeting great hunters at night while people aren’t watching.

92
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:18,635
They also told us not to meet young ladies at night.

93
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:32,630
They said that if we become confident and take a girl because people aren’t watching, we will bring death upon ourselves.

94
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,920
We "pretend to have wives."

95
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:40,455
They talked about that to have us fear it.

96
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:49,290
And when girls had their first menstruations at home, they would tell them, "Now, from here, you menstruate.

97
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:59,325
"Never pass an unmarried young man, a boy, upwind from him, but over there downwind like this.

98
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:09,880
"If he smells your emanations, he will get addicted to it. Eventually, it will ruin him."

99
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,740
Would they tell you that? (They would tell us.)

100
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,540
Don’t you recognize that?

101
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,660
No, I recognize it completely.

102
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:22,935
They say he smells her emanations.

103
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:36,295
Then now, when they tell me to speak about old traditional instructions, I reply in my mind

104
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:46,250
"Our traditional instruction back before Western contact is late. It’s late."

105
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:58,075
You see, the young children of the next generation that I see are now getting into the Western way of life.

106
00:15:59,515 --> 00:16:12,465
They also make fun of the Yupik language that Yupiit, their mothers and fathers, grew up with, what they call a language in English.

107
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:16,995
Instead, they choose to speak only in English.

108
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:27,305
That’s why when I should be instructing on our traditional instructions, and speaking on them

109
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:36,185
I started thinking that it’s too late. Neither am I excited to teach what I was instructed.

110
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:44,990
Because after some people listen to me, if he looks away, he will drop it without respecting my stories.

111
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,790
But when he sees a Caucasian, he will change, smile, and go to him speaking English.

112
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,550
And he forgets what I instructed, does not remember them.

113
00:16:57,165 --> 00:17:10,605
But what we were told was that if we come into possession of fur that is worth some money, not to let it pass by.

114
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,120
They said that we should keep it until there’s more.

115
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:27,285
They said that if there’s more and we sell a lot of even little things, we will get helpful things from them.

116
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,890
Or, one time, one of my grandfathers said to me

117
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:41,635
"Now, when you start hunting seals, do not keep letting them pass you by.

118
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:51,210
"If you keep even one hide, there will come more, until eventually you have enough to make a kayak."

119
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,650
Since mink skins are worth less these days

120
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:09,100
It’s become easy to trade mink skins in stores, trading in fur.

121
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:13,935
They suddenly get enough for kayaks.

122
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:26,710
Since they’ve stopped using kayaks, I am no longer excited to talk about our ancestors’ ways.

123
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:34,420
Watching these, including my children whom I instruct

124
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:47,740
When I teach those traditional instructions, even though my children, my sons, do not [physically] do it, it seems they come and close my mouth.

125
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:59,710
It’s because my children whom I teach do not follow those traditional teachings.

126
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,945
That’s why I feel inarticulate.

127
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:12,645
Though I want teach our ancestors ways, it is late, as they say in English.

128
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:23,415
And sometimes, after I teach my grandchildren when they’re gathered, I ask them, "Do you understand my instruction?"

129
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:33,985
"Ung’alu," they say they didn’t understand what I had been taught when I speak to them in Yup’ik.

130
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:39,905
Well, I’m tired of speaking. This is all I’ll say.

131
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:47,635
I want more when they tell a few stories upriver in KYUK in Yup’ik.
