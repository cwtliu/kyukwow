1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
...with this, [we would try to catch] wilderness animals...

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:16,460
With this, we’d try to catch wilderness animals, riverine animals, and fish.

3
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:23,620
We get them when we’d gather and subsist.

4
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,490
And one who doesn’t subsist has nothing, is poor, and has no food.

5
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:37,390
They say that’s what they call that one who doesn’t gather anything.

6
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:41,650
But they said that one who subsists obtains things.

7
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,060
Back in our time

8
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:56,640
Widows, and you know, whom we call the poor, and the orphans

9
00:00:56,645 --> 00:01:04,455
Back then, there were those who had no financial care

10
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:10,335
Because there was no welfare back then.

11
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:19,025
But these people who were able by the themselves, those who could catch from the wilderness

12
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:24,760
Those who are good hunters gather food.

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:33,750
They say that that one who is to care [for the less fortunate] is given by God to catch many things

14
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,320
So that [s]he can give those to them.

15
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:43,890
So, our parents back then would always tell us this:

16
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:50,425
"Now, when you go, when you are able to provide for yourself

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:02:00,830
"For those people, if you have some, if you obtain what you can use to help

18
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:09,420
"Give as much food as you can to one without food

19
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:16,770
"Especially widows, the poor, and orphans.

20
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:21,035
"And not always just with food.

21
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:33,550
"If you have clothes for him, if you have extra, help him with clothes to wear if you have any.

22
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:43,550
"If you have anything to help that person, you must."

23
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:53,845
They’d also tell us this

24
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:56,655
Not always that

25
00:02:56,655 --> 00:03:08,725
Some mornings, my mother would tell me back when I was young when I got up

26
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:18,125
"Now, go out there and check on the people.

27
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:26,720
"They won’t have water, won’t have wood, and won’t have something.

28
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,750
"Go and check on them, and the women with no providers."

29
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:39,260
As she requested

30
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:46,180
Since I knew those women and those without providers needed that

31
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:50,255
Those who couldn’t gather wood on their own

32
00:03:50,365 --> 00:04:00,895
I would go to them and help them with my body even though it was food, if they didn’t have wood

33
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:04,705
Because they said wood was [to help with] a food source.

34
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:13,985
They said wood is like a food source. They said one cannot cook food without wood.

35
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:21,310
That was how I was supposed to share as the one who raised me told me to

36
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:28,620
"Now, go check on the people out there, and help them with whatever they lack.

37
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,920
"Also, if you have food any know of anyone

38
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,140
"Now, try to give that person food.

39
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:48,075
"You see, that person’s gratitude to you is very great."

40
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:57,105
Watch, they said, our caretaker, the Spirit of the Universe, will exchange his gratitude for more.

41
00:04:57,225 --> 00:05:03,115
This is all for sharing

42
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:13,155
Helping each other, and giving depending on how much one is lacking.

43
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,540
This is all I’m saying about it.

44
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,330
Okay. I just wanted to...

45
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:32,410
Well, helping out is an ancient practice.

46
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:39,070
And people back then who helped out wouldn’t want to take payments.

47
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:43,185
Our ancestors back then wouldn’t take payments when helping out.

48
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:52,205
They used to help out without requiring payment.

49
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:59,835
And families, relatives, would live together in single houses.

50
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:03,385
Back at that time

51
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:16,300
Families, relatives, in one house, would live in one huge sod house with wooden accouterments.

52
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:27,290
Across there were those who subsisted, and here those with children, four families would live like that in the house.

53
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:37,120
I was also born at the cusp of that, when relatives lived in traditional sod houses like that.

54
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,420
People back then had good relations, loved each other.

55
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:50,055
And now, my ancestors are actually from Qinaq.

56
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:55,890
That one from Qinaq who stood up this morning and spoke is from the same village as I am

57
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,860
That boy who was the very first to open up our gathering.

58
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,250
My ancestors, my parents were from Qinaq.

59
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:15,000
Back in my earliest memories, that village had one resident Caucasian.

60
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:26,910
That village was my earliest memories, a village where they lived across the river from each other over there.

61
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,320
That village apparently had that one resident Caucasian.

62
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:40,760
It’s unfortunate that helping out these days is no longer practiced.

63
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:50,380
They can’t prepare for guests anymore. Though young people are able, they can’t do them on their own anymore.

64
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,030
And without payment, they can’t do it without a little payment.

65
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,180
Back then, those people evidently practiced love.

66
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:14,450
And those who couldn’t fish, and the unemployed who couldn’t drink Western tea

67
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:21,830
All winter, they’d eat of people’s gifts.

68
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,415
I also had my earliest memories.

69
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:32,610
I have early memories when my father passed away when I was very small.

70
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,670
And after that back then

71
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:44,410
From there where my earliest memories were

72
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:56,460
My maternal aunt’s husband brought us upriver to Lomavik.

73
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:07,270
I also stayed there downriver at Lomavik until I became aware, and from then on, I have always been aware.

74
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:16,410
People took care of us. My mother had no provider.

75
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:22,435
Gifts were a cause for great thanks.

76
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:31,650
Food, and clothing, clothing that covers this body

77
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:38,330
People’s gifts were very great to me, in my opinion.

78
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:41,805
I am extremely thankful for them.

79
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:52,660
I would covet those with fathers, families, large familes, many siblings.

80
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:05,050
People’s helping out, taking care of others, helping others

81
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:15,410
Those people back then who helped out gave me this to say right now.

82
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,170
I am very thankful for them.

83
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:26,810
You see, these days, you know how you say that people have changed?

84
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,540
We know how they’ve changed.

85
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,080
Families, close relatives do not act like relatives anymore.

86
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:39,780
And some don’t know their relatives, or their mothers’ relatives.

87
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,240
And they don’t know their fathers’ relatives these days.

88
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:50,795
It’s because people’s treating each other with love has changed now.

89
00:10:51,585 --> 00:11:00,800
Then when I asked after that time, "How did those in the home live?"

90
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,570
My mother would tell me this:

91
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,920
Those people lived

92
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:19,260
This didn’t claim anything, and this didn’t speak of their food, and they didn’t say they’re low or gone.

93
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,780
Very tight-knit relatives had one house.

94
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:30,515
And no one was stingy.

95
00:11:30,995 --> 00:11:37,725
She said those families helped their relatives a lot.

96
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:46,660
And they never refused them anything. Even if it was their only one, they’d have them use it without payment.

97
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:53,060
You see, these days, every little thing

98
00:11:53,515 --> 00:12:02,055
What was to be for help, to be given, has turned profitable.

99
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,620
We also had a traditional instruction.

100
00:12:09,015 --> 00:12:16,325
Though we’re women, just women, and can’t buy anything

101
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:19,880
That we can help people out.

102
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:27,740
I thought like this back when I heard this: "I wonder what I can use to help out?"

103
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:30,945
My mother said this to me:

104
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:39,530
"If you say something to a depressed person, if you say something good, you will help them."

105
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,650
Then she also said this to me:

106
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:49,390
"His tattered clothes with many holes without anyone to sew it

107
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:57,010
"If you sew the tears closed, you shall help him."

108
00:12:57,015 --> 00:13:07,585
Those were how we helped others back in our lives without money to help others.

109
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:10,495
That’s how we helped

110
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:18,265
And because I used to practice mending these clothes.

111
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:23,655
You see, it also becomes a habit if anyone starts this.

112
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:31,410
And if they see something torn here, they’ll remember it, "Let me fix this now."

113
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,690
One can learn like that. Anything can become a habit.

114
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:41,250
When I practiced that, it became my habit.

115
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:48,290
Even if they’re these Caucasians, when I see them, I want to [mend] them.

116
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:53,165
And I would think that I want to mend that tear closed.

117
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:57,555
It’s because anything can become a habit.

118
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:03,015
In helping out, there are many ways to help a person.

119
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:24,685
We’ve understood part of the many ways to help others through food

120
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:32,955
Because we helped each other back in our time by giving to each other.

121
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:43,110
And since some who do not catch anything, fish, or are unable have great shortages of food in the spring

122
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:52,540
Since through that, we carry them through food scarcity until food comes.

123
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:03,490
But we’re going to move on to this: helping each other.

124
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:12,490
Helping each other as a community.

125
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:22,885
Helping each other with something, or sometimes, we practice that in villages.

126
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:31,645
Sometimes, one of us has a some big job to do

127
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:35,895
Or trying to build a house

128
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:44,135
Or because they had wooden homes back then, since they didn’t have wooden boards at that time

129
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:49,175
Also because there were none of this plywood back then.

130
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:58,065
But since people would get wood for houses from here on the Kuskokwim

131
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:03,165
Since they don’t use those much anymore.

132
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:09,995
Also, though they regularly used what they called mudhouses in my time

133
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:18,105
Since they used those at that time in spring camps, fish camps, and winter camps

134
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:21,120
Thye used those for a long time.

135
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:31,630
But in small villages like this, they ask for help when they work on something because they find them difficult

136
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:39,940
And since wood is not light, and we had no machines to pull them back then

137
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:45,300
But, because they took them by hand.

138
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:53,380
Also, since they spoke to each other

139
00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:03,070
They notify us, they notify those around them when they work on this that needs help.

140
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:13,990
Then the people of that village prod us

141
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:23,130
That even if it’s not big and we won’t have to help, to go to them.

142
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:31,330
When those adults worked together

143
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,940
When they ordered us, we’d get something though it wasn’t important.

144
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:44,100
And when they asked for a tool or something, we’d get it.

145
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:52,620
We were like the arms for these adults when they worked on something.

146
00:17:52,620 --> 00:18:04,680
And when they were going to make houses, since they brought them inland to where it’s going to be worked on, they’d bring them up from the water here.

147
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:12,985
Or also, a long time ago

148
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,280
These villages would ask for help with this.

149
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:29,180
And when they were going to build a community house, since making a community house is a big job

150
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,430
And since it needed huge logs of wood.

151
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:39,560
They’d invite, kelegluki, villages.

152
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:49,200
When they thought their people would be to few, they’d invite villages to their own.

153
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:57,505
They say that they were going to work on a community house, and asked for help.

154
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:07,610
Then those villages that they invited would arrive, they would arrive there since they were invited.

155
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,210
But the wood they were going to use was already ready down there.

156
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:24,915
Then several villages, even two they invited, would work together and help each other.

157
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:32,505
They’d help each other work on that huge sod house, the community house.

158
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:37,815
And since they covered community houses with sod back then

159
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:48,750
And since they covered them in sod after they spread grass to prevent crumbling down

160
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,930
When they finished setting the logs on their sides.

161
00:19:54,295 --> 00:20:04,245
They would work on it like that until it was finished.

162
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:17,675
When they were finished, this host village would hold what we call today a potluck for the villages they invited.

163
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:26,860
Back then, they’d hold a feast like a small dance festival when that community house was finished.

164
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:35,780
Oh my, they would even Yup’ik dance like a reward for that to them.

165
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:38,160
They had them enjoy themselves.

166
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:44,060
And after they had a feast, when that was finished

167
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:48,275
They would end with that feast.

168
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:54,585
They had a potluck, and were very happy, even Yup’ik dancing.

169
00:20:54,585 --> 00:21:00,225
They cooperated with them, helping each other out.

170
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:09,670
And like that with what one person was going to make, because they helped each other

171
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:18,910
With what they were going to do, they helped with that one person’s project.

172
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:28,575
They’d even tell us to help out and stay among them.

173
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:39,125
And those villages, even if they weren’t helped that one person

174
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:50,975
With their ways of helping, when this village brought up something that they wanted to do

175
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:59,765
They said long ago when there were settlements down there

176
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:03,735
And since there weren’t many villages

177
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:14,145
After the Moravion missions first started, the people really worked together.

178
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,970
These missions got a lot of wooden board [houses].

179
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:27,565
So, we made boardwalks going from the mission to what they called that big store upriver.

180
00:22:30,155 --> 00:22:34,605
People back then didn’t do it to get payment.

181
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:46,410
Women [know] about how to love children

182
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:55,040
Especially because they take care of them as children starting from when they’re born.

183
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:07,580
That’s why, with some of what Lucy knows about how to love children

184
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:18,000
Using what she knows, she will tell us what she thinks.

185
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:26,585
Using what you know about loving children

186
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:37,280
Women care for them from when they’re born when they care for them when they’re born.

187
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:44,550
Talk about how much you know about their love for children.

188
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,630
About children long ago

189
00:23:56,635 --> 00:24:04,545
Our caretakers back then took care of us, giving instruction about everything.

190
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:13,530
Starting from when we married, they’d always instruct us so we wouldn’t be ignorant of anything.

191
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:21,940
And when we had children, they’d instruct us on how to care for children.

192
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:30,000
Our caretakers back then, you see, were not like how they are now.

193
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:37,100
We didn’t see many Caucasians, and we didn’t see any money.

194
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,280
I didn’t first see money for a long time.

195
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:51,435
Because I grew up in scarcity, I woulnd’t get those things.

196
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:58,610
Also, I do not forget how my mother took care of me.

197
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,300
I clearly remember it.

198
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,010
This is how my mother took care of me:

199
00:25:06,745 --> 00:25:14,635
This food, she didn’t let me squander food and water.

200
00:25:14,635 --> 00:25:19,230
Instead, all she gave me [was all I ingested].

201
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,110
You see, my stomach is used to it now.

202
00:25:23,115 --> 00:25:25,985
I’m going to tell you what I’m like.

203
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:33,205
My stomach is used to my eating habits since long ago.

204
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:42,390
Before noon, I will not fill it to this day.

205
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:47,185
Neither do I fill it before dinner.

206
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:52,000
It’s used to me not nibbling at random times.

207
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,690
You see, the ancestors long ago were not like this.

208
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,610
They don’t nibble at random between meals.

209
00:26:01,615 --> 00:26:04,370
Becuase there were three meals:

210
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,430
They drank something hot in the morning.

211
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:13,810
Then during lunch at noon they would eat real food.

212
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,250
We would eat and be full then.

213
00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:24,910
What we were given from our mothers wouldn’t be enough to fill. We’d want more.

214
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,690
And here in the evening, we’d have dinner.

215
00:26:28,695 --> 00:26:33,225
Then after, we wouldn’t ingest anything else until the morning.

216
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:38,605
And at night, our stomachs were used to it, and we wouldn’t be thirsty at night.

217
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,290
Only when we awoke in the morning would we have a little something.

218
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:51,760
And when I didn’t have a little pancake, my mother would give me a little piece of fish

219
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,540
Because we didn’t have an abundance.

220
00:26:54,545 --> 00:27:00,435
Then I wouldn’t have more than what she gave

221
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:02,855
And I wouldn’t try to have more.

222
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,600
Like this you see, a person can practice this.

223
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:12,635
If our descendants learn it, they can practice it.

224
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:23,615
With my stomach, I am going forth with with my eating habits to this day.

225
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:28,230
Some of them however, these things

226
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,490
It’s become different from how I’ve taken care of these things.

227
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:40,265
But, they never let us ingest anything walking around or standing.

228
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:43,440
They never let us eat while standing.

229
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:50,490
I also see this now, and I just watch you as I came in this morning

230
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:56,950
Drinking coffee, taking the cup, then walking around.

231
00:27:56,955 --> 00:28:00,910
Listen, does it really settle well inside?

232
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,780
This is how it’s changed.

233
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,830
It’s how the instruction of the people back then has changed.

234
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,450
When I came in this morning, I watched you.

235
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:16,735
After this person fills their cup without asking permission from above

236
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:23,250
After filling a cup, they go, drink while walking, and goes into rooms.

237
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,250
You see, that’s how it’s changed.

238
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:33,245
You say that the lifestyle of people back then has changed.

239
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,945
This is one of the changes.

240
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,360
You see, when we had children

241
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:48,430
They never let them be soiled by their urine.

242
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:53,890
We didn’t take care of our children by putting them in diapers.

243
00:28:53,895 --> 00:29:01,935
More recently, children have started wearing diapers because of increased Westernization.

244
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:09,210
We used to take care of children, getting up every time they moved at night.

245
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:12,930
We with children couldn’t afford to be lazy.

246
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:18,740
It’s because we loved children. We took care of them with great love.

247
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,430
We didn’t keep leaving them, and we wouldn’t babysit.

248
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:30,980
Now, I have borne 14 children.

249
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,180
Those ten

250
00:29:34,185 --> 00:29:42,580
These ten, I gave birth to in my home without going to the hospital.

251
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,410
Then these other four after the ten

252
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:51,960
Only when my body here was not completely healthy

253
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:58,670
I’d come here and give birth to these four.

254
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:03,850
But three of these were not born in the maternity ward.

255
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:10,130
Only this very last youngest one was born in the maternity ward.

256
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:21,360
It’s because I wouldn’t suffer for a long time, not be in labor for long

257
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,080
Because I experienced the suffering of childbirth.

258
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:30,900
I’ve said what I know.

259
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,010
When I was first pregnant, my mother would instruct me

260
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:47,270
"If you want to give birth well, and if you want good labors without going for a long time

261
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:53,395
"At night and day, every time you think of it, go outside."

262
00:30:53,395 --> 00:31:00,645
You see, we didn’t doubt what instructions we were given as we practiced them.

263
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:04,690
We’d practice them.

264
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:11,440
Then when the child was born, we took care of them.

265
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,520
We’d take care of the dear one with our mothers to instruct us.

266
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:21,660
When they stirred as they got up and night, we let the tiny newborn urinate.

267
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:28,180
Always doing that, we didn’t let it get wet, kept the bedding dry, never soiling it.

268
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:35,555
Then back when I did that and learned about clocks when clocks came

269
00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:41,010
I learned the times when they defecated and urinated.

270
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,880
Then I started taking care of them.

271
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,770
You see, our caretakers, our mothers, would tell us

272
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:57,140
"When they grow up, don’t raise your voice at them.

273
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,160
"Admonish them without adding to your voice.

274
00:32:01,165 --> 00:32:05,100
"If you do that, they will be obedient to you.

275
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:14,340
"However, if you add to your voice, speak loudly to them, and shout at them

276
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:18,015
"The child will not live well like that.

277
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:22,195
"They will be stubborn and disobedient."

278
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:30,120
You see, I’m speaking about what I know of what I was instructed.

279
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:42,500
About those, they say, and I’ve heard them say

280
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,290
They say the Yup’ik lifestyle has changed now.

281
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,450
Those are the changes.

282
00:32:49,455 --> 00:32:56,430
Look, everything had traditional wisdom to us.

283
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,170
They had instructions.

284
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:06,830
Sometimes, when we disobey them

285
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:13,810
There is also regret about disobeying that traditional wisdom.

286
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:23,915
That is what I know about raising children, loving children.

287
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:30,565
If a person loves a child, then they must take care of them with love like that.

288
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:35,075
Also, let them know about what will bring them misfortune.

289
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:44,310
Let them know about what will bring them shame, get them incarcerated, what will put them in jail.

290
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:50,770
You see, the most important things for us parents with our children

291
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:56,470
When one of our relatives happens to be brought to jail

292
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:05,910
They parents cannot socialize well with their relatives because of those

293
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:12,005
Because they raised them, took care of them.

294
00:34:12,215 --> 00:34:16,210
You see, this is how it’s changed.

295
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:25,340
You say that those people have changed, that the traditional ways of people back then have changed.

296
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,070
And we know that it’s changed now.

297
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:36,220
I first started what what you know about one of the changes.

298
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:42,240
They wouldn’t have us ingest anything walking around.

299
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:49,455
And though we were very thirsty after eating, they wouldn’t give us water right away.

300
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:55,685
Then our mouths would be dry because we were so thirsty.

301
00:34:55,685 --> 00:35:00,175
And that saliva turned white.

302
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:06,445
Only when that happened did they give us a little water, then we drank that.

303
00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:13,385
And though we really wanted more, we didn’t have more, they didn’t let us have more.

304
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,560
We waited for meals.

305
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:24,320
We were used to it. That is how I was taken care of by my mother.

306
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,130
My stomach only follows it, is used to it.

307
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:35,280
It got used to not being filled randomnly outside of meals.

308
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:45,840
I want to translate what you’ve said into English because [?] does not speak [Yup’ik].

309
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,460
And I just said that children didn’t have diapers.

310
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:53,275
We didn’t put them in those to take care of them.

311
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:59,975
Instead, we watched for when they urinated to keep them from doing it on the floor.

312
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,660
She said that...

313
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:08,350
My mom said the helped me my first time.

314
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,890
But after I gave birth

315
00:36:11,895 --> 00:36:17,325
Giving birth once, my mother helped me with the eldest.

316
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:25,270
Then afterwards, when I was going to give birth to the second

317
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:32,550
Across there in the original Bethel over there around the airport

318
00:36:32,555 --> 00:36:36,550
I gave birth to the second after the first.

319
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,930
I knew when [s]he was going to be born.

320
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:50,940
And since I knew, I prepared by getting bedding, a mattress for when I gave birth.

321
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,180
After I prepared bedding, since I did it in the summer in July

322
00:36:56,185 --> 00:37:03,335
I gave birth a second time on July 6.

323
00:37:05,945 --> 00:37:12,815
Then after I prepared, I took scissors

324
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:17,285
Since I watched my mother taking care of me in my first childbirth.

325
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:23,345
I set out scissors and thread to tie with.

326
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:29,570
Then when that child was born, I took care of it myself.

327
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:36,700
The belly button, umbilical cord, and the end over there.

328
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:44,460
When [s]he was born, tie it here, and tie it here, then I scissored the middle the cut it.

329
00:37:44,465 --> 00:37:47,295
I took care of them myself.

330
00:37:47,295 --> 00:37:55,430
But the four who were born inland after the ten, these ones after the ten

331
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:00,270
Since I did it fourteen times, I’m telling you this story.

332
00:38:00,665 --> 00:38:04,935
[?] was the father ever involved in this?

333
00:38:05,545 --> 00:38:09,595
Did you understand? Let me intrepret back for those that didn’t understand.

334
00:38:10,845 --> 00:38:16,720
Since some women were frail back then

335
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,210
When there was no other woman in their village

336
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:26,010
When they were alone and helped each other

337
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:33,050
Her husband would tie those umbilical cords and cut them.

338
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:46,365
When there was a woman nearby, her spouse would invite her, saying that his spouse was [giving birth] and to be her midwife.

339
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:55,625
Another woman would help her from what I know of back then.

340
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:02,570
However, her spouse, when he didn’t have help, when they didn’t have help

341
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:08,785
When she couldn’t do it alone, her spouse would help her in childbirth.

342
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:12,550
This is what that’s like.

343
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:20,320
Then also, watching over children respectfully

344
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:25,940
Part of it is also like this:

345
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:35,850
When a child can’t get up [from sleep], they don’t know when they’re taught.

346
00:39:35,855 --> 00:39:42,030
And though they’re told something, they don’t understand yet.

347
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:50,350
Then when they get up, when their bodies are strong as they get up, when they start sitting

348
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:59,565
Those things that are dangerous to them, the hot food on the table when they ate

349
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:06,695
Since that child doesn’t know about getting burned

350
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:13,105
Have that child touch that hot thing.

351
00:40:13,105 --> 00:40:21,880
Then after doing that, try to let them touch that [again].

352
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:28,770
They already learn. That child knows that it’s hot.

353
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:38,430
They said that for getting accidentally burned, they know what is hot.

354
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:48,000
Because it’s like they become a little aware when they start sitting

355
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,080
And when fed when they start eating

356
00:40:52,255 --> 00:40:57,795
They teach their child of those.

357
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,960
Then when they do something

358
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:10,260
Also admonish them when they try to grab things too much.

359
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:15,850
Don’t let them take it, don’t let them take it.

360
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:23,775
They say that when a child grows up grabbing things

361
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,730
Allowing them to grab these things

362
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:37,070
When they grow up a little, when they grow up and become able

363
00:41:37,225 --> 00:41:45,620
They are no longer inhibited from taking things.

364
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,090
They can also take someone of another person if they want to.

365
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:58,470
A long time ago, they were not admonished, but were allowed to take whatever they wanted.

366
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:08,060
But if they admonish against those from the start

367
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,690
They will also learn more like that.

368
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,810
Also, when they start understanding, when a child starts understanding

369
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:24,460
When they understand what we say as they grow more

370
00:42:24,855 --> 00:42:30,745
We have this wisdom from those who raised us:

371
00:42:30,745 --> 00:42:33,645
They said if we have children like this

372
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:41,730
They said that when a child first wakes up on the morning, they are aware.

373
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:50,060
They get up without being wily, not shouting, not bursting out laughing, but quiet.

374
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,480
They say they’re aware.

375
00:42:52,525 --> 00:43:04,035
They said that when they’re aware to then tell them a piece of traditional wisdom.

376
00:43:04,035 --> 00:43:13,105
They said that as they are aware, if they pay attention to the wisdom passed down to them

377
00:43:14,285 --> 00:43:19,445
Sometimes we say, "Look, they’re aware."

378
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:26,127
When these children start staying still, "They’re aware," looking at one thing.

379
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,766
They say they’re like that in the morning.

380
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:35,247
If that child is spoken to as if they were aware.

381
00:43:35,258 --> 00:43:40,188
And they say they will not forget it, but remember it more clearly.

382
00:43:40,192 --> 00:43:45,002
But they sit still later after they are given traditional wisdom.

383
00:43:45,012 --> 00:43:50,962
And when we wake up, we start moving about and [?becoming actively awake].

384
00:43:50,972 --> 00:43:55,282
Then after that child sits still

385
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:03,500
They start moving around as if they are not aware anymore.

386
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:07,937
Then when they grow up more, say to them

387
00:44:08,204 --> 00:44:12,124
"Treat those around you with love, okay?"

388
00:44:12,137 --> 00:44:14,707
Tell them about this.

389
00:44:14,712 --> 00:44:21,922
Since you love them, tell them to treat those around them with love.

390
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:26,910
"Treat those around you with love today, okay?"

391
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:35,969
They say that because their mother or father loves them, they want them to go [through life] well with them

392
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:42,823
Also because it’s the most important traditional instruction, tell them to love those around them.

393
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:51,172
Then they said that a woman sometimes, though that person is not her own child

394
00:44:51,184 --> 00:44:59,474
When she sees that child, another person’s child, just like her own child

395
00:44:59,487 --> 00:45:08,407
She also tells them of traditional wisdom, loving them as much as her own child.

396
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:16,217
I don’t understand the meaning of why they do that.

397
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:22,047
We from the upper Nushagak River also do that.

398
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:29,889
When we catch those dangerous things upriver, including grizzly bears, and black bears

399
00:45:29,979 --> 00:45:34,529
When we first catch those

400
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,244
Its blood

401
00:45:40,221 --> 00:45:49,801
We open the mouth of our dangerous catch, reach into it, and take some saliva.

402
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:55,245
Then after putting it on our hands, we apply it on our faces.

403
00:45:55,249 --> 00:45:59,439
They say that when that bear sees us

404
00:45:59,444 --> 00:46:05,784
Through that, when they see us living as one of them

405
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:14,449
They will not come to us and do this, wanting to harm us.

406
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:21,791
They respect their saliva that we applied to our faces.

407
00:46:21,805 --> 00:46:24,375
That’s what it’s like. (I see.)

408
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:30,432
They do that so that they will not fear [a bear].

409
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:38,323
Okay, we asked the original question about the ritual of getting the first seal.

410
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:47,281
It’s been discontinued for a long time because there are these priests.

411
00:46:47,296 --> 00:46:51,006
It’s been discontinued since a long time.

412
00:46:51,014 --> 00:47:01,334
I’m going to explain, talk about, the meaning of the time when they started doing that.

413
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:06,212
They said that long ago, they didn’t used to do that.

414
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:15,252
But when that child’s father had him sent to the bladders

415
00:47:15,263 --> 00:47:19,283
When they had sent him

416
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:27,785
When he had stayed there for a year with the living beings, along with the seals, the bearded seals back then.

417
00:47:28,174 --> 00:47:34,224
Only when he had come back home the next year after his stay was complete

418
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:38,821
That child had them start doing that.

419
00:47:40,197 --> 00:47:45,937
He had them start giving those seals water like that.

420
00:47:47,947 --> 00:47:52,927
After that time, they started doing that to [the seals].

421
00:47:52,931 --> 00:48:01,301
When he was a child, he had gone over there where the living [seals] go and stayed.

422
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:05,630
And he only returned when a year had passed.

423
00:48:05,646 --> 00:48:11,356
Only when it was time for him to go did he return.

424
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,390
He started that tradition.

425
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:23,910
When they caught those seals, they wouldn’t throw their bladders away, but inflate them.

426
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:30,400
They inflated the bladders of every seal down there, and kept them all summer.

427
00:48:30,411 --> 00:48:36,541
Then only when fall set did they pop them, stuff them under the ice, and had them drift away.

428
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:42,161
They would do that with seals when they caught them.

429
00:48:42,172 --> 00:48:49,762
Its spirit might be there in its bladder. I think they say it’s in the bladder.

430
00:48:49,776 --> 00:48:55,356
They say they come the next year. They would say that.

431
00:48:55,368 --> 00:49:04,118
They say that those that were caught, that blatter returns to be caught again by the one who had caught it.

432
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:11,176
That’s what they believed happened to them.

433
00:49:11,252 --> 00:49:18,882
They would send the bladders away, asking them to come again, when they held the Bladder Festival.

434
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,819
Speaking of part of it, they said that that...

435
00:49:21,832 --> 00:49:24,992
Later. Let me translate this first.

436
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:28,946
Kurt Bell...

437
00:49:28,955 --> 00:49:33,485
The shaman, the child of that couple

438
00:49:33,496 --> 00:49:40,566
The children of that couple wouldn’t live in the past, always dying.

439
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:49,769
Then one of their children, that shaman wanted to do that with their child.

440
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:54,407
He wanted to send him along with the bladders.

441
00:49:54,412 --> 00:50:01,422
The shaman did that, [sending] him to the place of those living beings.

442
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:06,633
But he saw the place of those living beings as a house.

443
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:13,589
When he arrived to the place of these seals in the winter

444
00:50:13,606 --> 00:50:18,596
They said some of them picked on him.

445
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:26,430
That one sent with the bladders [was picked on by] those seals and spotted seals.

446
00:50:26,439 --> 00:50:29,249
They were different there.

447
00:50:29,262 --> 00:50:33,532
However, they said some of them treated him with love.

448
00:50:33,545 --> 00:50:38,325
They said that when after he went home and started hunting

449
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:45,650
He would recognize those spotted seals or ringed seals.

450
00:50:45,662 --> 00:50:49,462
He recognized them like us people.

451
00:50:49,477 --> 00:50:58,697
They said that when he started hunting, since he recognized them, he would shoot arrows at them with great force.

452
00:50:58,699 --> 00:51:05,419
He would shoot arrows at them, or harpoon them, doing it with force since he recognized them.

453
00:51:05,436 --> 00:51:07,906
That’s what that’s like.

454
00:51:07,908 --> 00:51:13,438
He expanded on that one about the boy going out to the seals.

455
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:22,145
There was a man and a wife whose children did not make it, kept dying, kept dying.

456
00:51:22,152 --> 00:51:32,892
And so, this one child, the shaman asked the man and wife to send that child with bladders out to the sea.

457
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:37,211
And so, that’s what he did.

458
00:51:39,023 --> 00:51:43,273
And then, that boy lived...

459
00:51:43,443 --> 00:51:48,603
That’s how he went to their place to do that.

460
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:50,323
Okay, he...

461
00:51:50,335 --> 00:51:52,925
...[?] does it without doing it too hard.

462
00:51:53,475 --> 00:51:59,405
But he would do that with those that picked on him.

463
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:00,281
I understand it.

464
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:11,739
What he’s saying is that those people that were, or, those seals that he recognized that were good to him

465
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:15,170
He made sure that he made a good, clean kill.

466
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:19,172
You know, he really made sure that he did that.

467
00:52:19,267 --> 00:52:24,387
It seems like this was a really important ceremony to go through.

468
00:52:24,869 --> 00:52:30,890
Why did they stop that after Western contact?

469
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:38,981
They stopped doing that when priests came.

470
00:52:39,124 --> 00:52:42,644
When these priests came

471
00:52:42,654 --> 00:52:52,334
With those legends, when these priests came, they relinquished that practice and stopped doing it.

472
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:54,071
I see, like this?

473
00:52:54,154 --> 00:53:00,194
Which of these: out of shame, or did they tell you to stop?

474
00:53:00,957 --> 00:53:07,127
Though they weren’t told to stop, they stopped practicing that.

475
00:53:07,555 --> 00:53:15,055
The stopped practicing those practices they had with seals.

476
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:18,860
Okay, I’ll do one, and I hear something different over there.

477
00:53:18,868 --> 00:53:25,198
But Kurt Bell says that after the missionaries came, they stopped on their own.

478
00:53:27,185 --> 00:53:29,675
May I speak?

479
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:31,336
(Yes.) Okay.

480
00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:41,779
About the faces of bears, black bears or brown bears

481
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:47,571
With the first catch, he evidently applies [saliva] from its mouth to his face.

482
00:53:49,296 --> 00:53:51,886
When I was a boy...

483
00:53:51,894 --> 00:53:54,864
(Who are you?) Edward Weiss.

484
00:53:56,885 --> 00:54:02,636
They said this to me, my grandfather:

485
00:54:04,062 --> 00:54:15,292
After shooting and killing a black bear, he’d then have me apply the salive from inside its mouth on my face and hands.

486
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:18,791
Then he told me this:

487
00:54:19,306 --> 00:54:24,156
He said that when I grow up and start hunting

488
00:54:25,574 --> 00:54:36,464
He said that should a black bear or one of those brown bears get injured and takes me

489
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:41,293
He said it’ll see my face covered in its saliva.

490
00:54:41,302 --> 00:54:45,292
He said that that [bear] won’t breathe on me.

491
00:54:45,303 --> 00:54:55,663
Black bears’ breath and saliva are very strong for people.

492
00:54:55,668 --> 00:55:00,508
That’s why they can kill by breathing on them, making their faces swell.

493
00:55:00,513 --> 00:55:02,823
He said it won’t do that to me.

494
00:55:02,831 --> 00:55:06,101
Then afterwards

495
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:12,117
When I was some age, when I was 25

496
00:55:12,636 --> 00:55:16,486
I missed my gunshot, and a black bear took me.

497
00:55:16,495 --> 00:55:23,285
It took my gun like this, but it didn’t breath on my face.

498
00:55:23,294 --> 00:55:26,894
Instead, it looked away from me as it breathed.

499
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:31,186
That’s what he instructed.

500
00:55:31,196 --> 00:55:36,186
Even now, at least in our village upriver.

501
00:55:36,738 --> 00:55:42,575
Okay, that’s Edward Weiss from Kuskokwim.

502
00:55:42,586 --> 00:55:44,366
He said when his grandfather...

503
00:55:46,935 --> 00:55:57,382
From her point of view of you older men

504
00:55:57,879 --> 00:56:04,629
She thought that you would respect, qigcikluki, animals you hunted.

505
00:56:04,638 --> 00:56:09,138
She asked if now, in your opinion

506
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:17,611
Your descendants, are they doing that like you now?

507
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:20,126
Or, she asked, are they not?

508
00:56:20,136 --> 00:56:27,496
Or if they’re not, she asked this: do you think animals will deplete?

509
00:56:30,903 --> 00:56:37,523
Now, I’m going to give some answer to her question.

510
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:47,751
These seals, I don’t think of how the animals down from the ocean will be depleted.

511
00:56:48,793 --> 00:56:57,873
These instead, the birds, their chicks, and their eggs

512
00:56:58,011 --> 00:57:09,511
I admonish my descendants, my children, like this when their young hatch:

513
00:57:10,575 --> 00:57:14,680
Never to hunt.

514
00:57:15,068 --> 00:57:20,133
And never to [hunt] them when they’re chicks, when they’re small.

515
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:32,420
Though their mothers bring forth a lot, when they have too few chicks, I admonish them against [hunting] them.

516
00:57:32,433 --> 00:57:42,023
Those children, my children, are probably like those chicks.

517
00:57:42,103 --> 00:57:45,753
They are the reason I admonish them.

518
00:57:45,768 --> 00:57:52,538
Though those birds’ eggs aren’t my children, when their chicks hatch.

519
00:57:53,246 --> 00:58:01,376
And when they’re bigger, if a person is chasing them to another place, I will admonish them

520
00:58:01,379 --> 00:58:09,089
Its mother, never to kill both it and its mother.

521
00:58:09,094 --> 00:58:14,194
The mothers, I tell them their chicks won’t have any caretakers.

522
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:17,701
I say these seagulls don’t need anything else.

523
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:27,880
I said their chicks would be pitiful without any mothers to take care of them.

524
00:58:28,337 --> 00:58:31,177
That’s why I admonish them.

525
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:38,977
Well, he says that for him

526
00:58:38,984 --> 00:58:45,404
He doesn’t think that there’s not much danger to the seals right now.

527
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:50,762
But he tells his children about the birds.

528
00:58:50,772 --> 00:58:57,972
That when birds have, you know, when the eggs are hatching

529
00:58:57,983 --> 00:59:03,423
And the mother, father birds have to take care of them...

530
00:59:04,539 --> 00:59:07,919
And it’s no different.

531
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:18,325
We would hunt, then our mothers would honor our catch, be very thankful for it.

532
00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:25,849
Then now, we who’ve become fathers, that mother also know them since she has sons

533
00:59:25,852 --> 00:59:30,892
When her son catches a ptarmigan, she is very thankful and welcomes it.

534
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,891
She doesn’t think it’s too little.

535
00:59:33,901 --> 00:59:39,301
She is thankful for and honors everything he catches.

536
00:59:39,311 --> 00:59:47,461
She doesn’t leave them strewn, or where people have trod since they’re are our ancient admonishments.

537
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,071
He’s... these days...

538
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:55,171
[S]he will was their face. I don’t know that.

539
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:03,340
You see, we mothers who are younger than you have no instructors.

540
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:14,166
Would it be good if you here had them speak on KYUK News

541
01:00:14,172 --> 01:00:20,342
Or, give them time to instruct us?

542
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:24,480
We have many children trying to provide for themselves. We don’t know.

543
01:00:24,497 --> 01:00:27,647
I also leave my children in ignorance.

544
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:32,147
It’s because I don’t hear of them since it’s been a long time since I’ve lost my mother.

545
01:00:32,155 --> 01:00:36,735
I like when these older people speak.

546
01:00:36,744 --> 01:00:42,134
They’re true. They still are now, but they’re disappearing.

547
01:00:42,148 --> 01:00:46,888
Western teachings that have appeared are eclipsing them.

548
01:00:47,046 --> 01:00:51,566
It would be good of the Caucasians among us gave us time.

549
01:00:51,578 --> 01:01:02,568
If an elder speaks on KYUK radio or on the news to teach our children, that will help us.

550
01:01:04,132 --> 01:01:09,882
We would be thankful if they gave them time.

551
01:01:09,893 --> 01:01:12,683
There’s much to learn.

552
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:16,069
Thank you, Eliza.

553
01:01:16,483 --> 01:01:23,943
They instruct us when we’re going to hunt black bears...

554
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:34,159
...that we should get a wooden staff.

555
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:38,363
They said that that staff

556
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:46,192
You know how a staff is useful in the fall for thin ice or for dangerous areas.

557
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:52,458
That is a traditional instruction up north

558
01:01:52,466 --> 01:02:00,576
If we go to hunt a black bear in the mountains or travel anywhere, to always keep that staff on hand.

559
01:02:01,895 --> 01:02:09,881
Then when we travel for long enough, a black bear will attack us.

560
01:02:11,439 --> 01:02:19,609
They said that these black bears are like people. They grab like this like our hands.

561
01:02:20,307 --> 01:02:28,667
They said that before it takes our gun, that we should give it a staff right away.

562
01:02:28,673 --> 01:02:31,953
They said that that will save us.

563
01:02:31,964 --> 01:02:37,134
Give it to [the bear], it will take it, and we’ll shoot it.

564
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:49,920
We had shamans. We evidently had shamans.

565
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:56,850
We refer to those things back then as superstitions.

566
01:02:57,285 --> 01:03:02,525
They're superstitions. They're from shamans.

567
01:03:02,703 --> 01:03:07,753
Wait, wait, I don't understand that. "Piciruiq?"

568
01:03:07,934 --> 01:03:11,794
You know, it’s not true, but is from shamans.

569
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,240
A shaman is of the devil, by what we call it.

570
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,449
Those things

571
01:03:18,238 --> 01:03:26,288
When we got faith in God, many of those things, including medicine, have been given up.

572
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:27,950
They’re given up now.

573
01:03:28,903 --> 01:03:36,583
Then in our village now down on the coast

574
01:03:38,284 --> 01:03:45,524
We don’t give up hunting for seals.

575
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:59,032
Now, even if one is not young, ever year in the spring, when he catches the first seal

576
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:02,262
Also having caught one the year before

577
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:07,172
When the first man who goes spring seal hunting makes the first catch

578
01:04:08,565 --> 01:04:12,032
As we call it now, they distribute it.
