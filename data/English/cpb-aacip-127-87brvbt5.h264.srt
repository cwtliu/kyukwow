1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,130
You came in then sat down. Let’s begin.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,880
Ready?

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,610
Shall I begin?

4
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:15,485
This is medicinal, our medicine from a long time ago rosewort.

5
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:20,455
And in Yup’ik... what is it again?

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,260
I’ve forgotten it.

7
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:36,885
This was our medicine a long time ago. I’m going to cut and taste it.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,280
It’s terrible eating this little things.

9
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:49,305
Then when I had a sore throat, I eat the entire then, then my stomach felt better inside.

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,450
They’re good for stomach pains too.

11
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:02,714
This was our medicine a long time ago.

12
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,809
These are called caqlat in Yup’ik, caqlat.

13
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:11,159
They don’t eat these, except for their roots.

14
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:20,879
We didn’t know about them. My mom always used to tell me, Ceng’ulria, my great-grandma, about those.

15
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,174
And they’ve somehow changed these days.

16
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:30,164
They’ve started living Western lives, not using what they did long ago.

17
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:32,694
They’ve changed now.

18
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:39,604
They also used to try to scare us a long time ago.

19
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:47,684
They said that something would happen when we pretened to be a man’s wife. That’s what my mother used to tell me.

20
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:56,704
It turned out as I’ve turned old now, I would remember what my mother said.

21
00:01:56,704 --> 00:02:03,814
My mother would say, when I reached the bottom, when I reach the bottom I would remember my grandma.

22
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:07,564
I thought my grandma was my real mom.

23
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:19,252
And after I played, when I came in after I played outside, I would embrace her and suckle on her breasts. How old, I was older than 13.

24
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:26,856
It was because I was their baby, my mother’s [baby].

25
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:30,731
I was the baby, the only girl.

26
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:36,945
Our big family, only three of us are now living.

27
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:40,759
These two are men, and I’m alone.

28
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:45,513
I am the only one who’s alive.

29
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:50,538
TB claimed my older sisters.

30
00:02:50,551 --> 00:03:01,029
Since my mother wanted me, she did whatever she could to make me live, whatever she could.

31
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:10,173
She also had me eat these when I was small. Though I thought they tasted made, I would eat and swallow them.

32
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:14,010
Those are things from long ago.

33
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,396
Then one day, my mother told me

34
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,649
What did she call me? "Grandchild." "What?"

35
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:31,699
She said that if I go search for vole caches, she said that if I search gor mare’s-tail plant tubers in vole caches

36
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:38,982
She said that if I uncover quarruuget [sticklebacks], needlefish, in a vole cache

37
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:44,916
She said I should take only one, just one.

38
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:50,500
Then as I searched for vole cahces, I came upon one, so many were moving.

39
00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:58,140
Then I thought, "Oh my, didn’t my mother tell me that if I find sticklebacks that I should eat one?"

40
00:03:58,152 --> 00:04:01,219
Then I ate one.

41
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:07,161
When I was going to go to the wilderness, she would instruct me like that.

42
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:13,134
Then one day, my companion found a filled vole cache

43
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:17,325
Because Ignatius Black and I were friends when we were small.

44
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:21,389
When he found a filled vole cache, he called to me, "Oh my, what are these?"

45
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:27,747
Oh my, I went to him and found those bugs.

46
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:35,722
Those things that go into ears, meriit.

47
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:40,686
Oh my, they were moving. I wonder how they could be eaten?

48
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:47,610
After he had [?], I heard my companion say, "They’re not sticklebacks. I won’t eat those."

49
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:50,105
And we traveled on.

50
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:59,079
It turned out that when we arrived, my mother, my great-grandma, asked me what we did with those.

51
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:03,263
"So, did you eat?" "I ate." And she was thankful that I did.

52
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:11,055
Oh my, what were they? Maybe it was my mother’s doing. She seemed to do something to me.

53
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,050
Is it done?

54
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:16,242
Oh my goodness.

55
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:21,883
That’s what we did a long time ago.

56
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:33,617
And my baby son, my last baby was bitten, his older brother bit him.

57
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:38,579
He bit him here, he bit him here in two spots.

58
00:05:38,597 --> 00:05:45,041
I found him and found that he took this kind of thing

59
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:53,526
He stuffed the places where the teeth were with this.

60
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:56,704
He stuffed and bound them.

61
00:05:56,718 --> 00:06:07,240
The next day, he showed them, and oh my, it healed. And what was red and swollen was gone.

62
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:13,451
At that time, the clinic workers [?] him, [?].

63
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,669
He was supposed to get shots.

64
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:26,038
Because he didn’t want to go, he was supposed to go the evening of the next day, he had stuffed them with these without our knowledge.

65
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:32,320
And they healed. And they never said that anything was wrong with this part.

66
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:35,427
He stuffed it with these.

67
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:40,843
You see, my baby is always scared. These one is always scared too, you see.

68
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:53,416
My father... his father is my husband’s cross cousin.

69
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:58,948
They are cousins, they’ve been cousins for a long time.

70
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:03,749
He passed away several years ago.

71
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:10,140
After he passed away, I’ve been trying to raise my sons over there by myself.

72
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:17,536
I always tell them about his precautions.

73
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:23,959
And I never forget what my mother said, her precaution.

74
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:25,317
Is that all?

75
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:29,111
(Yes.) Thank you.

76
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:34,845
Okay.

77
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:42,466
Okay, thank you for this wonderful day [?] today.

78
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:53,588
So, I tried to obey my parents when I was small in my life.

79
00:07:54,396 --> 00:08:02,563
And my father’s wisdom never leaves my mind, when he used to tell me

80
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:10,350
If I do not live well, and I go to other villages that are not my own

81
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:18,971
If they hear my name, they will know that I am mischievous through what I’ve done.

82
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:28,445
He told me to try to make me feel ashamed [to be like that]. And now, I never forget his instruction.

83
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:38,736
My mother also told me to treat those around me with compassion.

84
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:44,520
You young people must obey your parents.

85
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:49,300
And never forget the traditional wisdom passed down to you when you were small.

86
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:57,707
You must especially respect your parents inside the home.

87
00:08:57,713 --> 00:09:03,246
Do not speak harshly or do not do things harshly.

88
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:07,520
Try not to upset your parents.

89
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:17,122
Your parents, those who are parents, are heartbroken without your knowledge when you cause trouble.

90
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:25,354
That is my piece of traditional wisdom, because I want you to be well.

91
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,770
Then, my parents used to tell me this:

92
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:44,042
If I do something, smoking, or some other thing that smells bad, in my house

93
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:52,961
Starting from when we were small, they would apply seal oil inside our noses because we might get headaches [from odors]

94
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:58,888
And because that odor might adversely affect us.

95
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:06,478
It’s the same with gas. Even though they’re not smoke, we get tired of smelling gas.

96
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:16,656
We must apply [seal oil] inside our noses, and apply it to children’s noses.

97
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:29,583
Also, if you go to the wilderness and suffer, you have no medicine if you have an accident in the wilderness.

98
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:44,184
If you have seal oil when you have a bad cough, if your throat inside is bad [?with prickling pain], you must [?take] seal oil. My mom used to do that to us.

99
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:50,476
Also, if we had a persistant cough, she would have us drink it.

100
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:57,811
When we didn’t have aspirin, she would do that to us when we were small because we had no clinic.

101
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:09,335
It is also clear how we can live well.

102
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:18,730
Though as for help from anyone, no one can help us. We alone can [have ourselves] live well.

103
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,132
Thank you very much.

104
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:25,414
Thank you. What you said is very nice.

105
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:33,474
Henrietty, John, Carlton, Eddie.

106
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,135
Seven?

107
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:34,977
Seven.

108
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:39,584
Wow, fourteen altogether? Then two adopted?

109
00:11:50,282 --> 00:11:53,527
Seven are living, right?

110
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:01,887
So, how many grandchildren do you have?

111
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:06,541
I don’t know. I have many grandchildren.

112
00:12:08,964 --> 00:12:10,530
Ready to start now?

113
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:18,201
It is not good for you to use this alcohol.

114
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:27,030
But this alcohol only leads to trouble.

115
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:36,252
Also, when a person abuses alcohol too much, he comes upon something wrong that he’s not supposed to do and brings misfortune upon himself.

116
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:40,051
And the other one, smoking...

117
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:42,940
Close it.

118
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:54,364
The other one, smoking, goes into this mind along with this body.

119
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:58,754
I don’t do it, [so I don’t know] what it’s like.

120
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:08,873
But I hear about what that smoking is like, that it destroys the mind.

121
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:14,533
Also, that person who smokes too much starts sleeping a lot.

122
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:19,712
I hear about that when they smoke.

123
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:29,797
That is probably true, that one who smoke too much starts sleeping a lot.

124
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:37,424
Also, you know? They forgot what to do.

125
00:13:37,436 --> 00:13:42,158
And after they put things down, they immediately forget them.

126
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:53,070
One of my sons, though I admonish them, since they sometimes do that

127
00:13:53,083 --> 00:14:03,161
I do scold them with what I can, like us, like us... this is my spouse.

128
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,621
Close it. Come here.

129
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,825
That’s my husband right here.

130
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:24,477
Stop [?].

131
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:27,828
Ready?

132
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:30,698
Can I quit?
