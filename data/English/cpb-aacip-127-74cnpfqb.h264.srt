1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,780
 ...when you [fist saw Caucasians], what did you think?

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,610
Well, we Yupiit were amazed by them.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,210
Were you scared of them or what?

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:17,980
I had no sense of fear, but I was amazed by them.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,390
I don’t know about the others.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,820
I see.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:31,800
When you were a little girl, you girls probably had traditional instructions.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:41,060
Now, I also hear that those in their first year of menstruations have admonishments.

9
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:46,185
Please talk about their admonishments.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,540
When a girl had her first menstruations, they wouldn’t let her travel.

11
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:57,420
They would have their children stay.

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:06,100
They would also keep her from getting too close to these unmarried boys.

13
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:16,115
They would watch them very carefully around those who were in the first year of menstruations.

14
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:25,625
They would speak to them, speak to that girl, instructing her about how she should be

15
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:29,945
And what it’s like when she’s started menstruating.

16
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:40,735
They used to very carefully watch over their young boys.

17
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:45,595
Now, they’re nothing like that these days.

18
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,300
They’re different now.

19
00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:53,305
How would they carefully watch over them?

20
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,910
What admonishment did they have to do that?

21
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:01,610
They carefully watched over them, admonished against them.

22
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:09,290
They also told them not to breathe on these young boys.

23
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:13,820
They told the not to get too close to them.

24
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:21,060
Also, they always have messy hair now.

25
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:24,535
They also told them never to have messy hair.

26
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:31,475
They told them never to have messy hair.

27
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:42,690
And when they made food for a young man, they told them never to have messy hair.

28
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:50,055
And they said that only after washing their hands to work on fish.

29
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:57,000
That was how they carefully watched them. They’d carefully watch them then.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:08,210
So, what’s the meaning behind not breathing on a boy? Or what’s the meaning because going downwind from him?

31
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,800
What did it mean?

32
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:19,930
They say that when that boy makes love to one in the first year of her menstruations, when something happens

33
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:28,385
A young man becomes bad, becomes abnormal, and lacks common sense.

34
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:37,045
That is what they feared about these girls within the first year of their menstruations.

35
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,900
What about when you started working on fish?

36
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,030
What traditional instructions were there about fish?

37
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,370
Everything had traditional isntructions back then.

38
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:01,739
What did they especially instruct about fish?

39
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:14,104
They would give a lot of traditional instructions about fish to these young girls, their children

40
00:04:14,104 --> 00:04:16,584
To treat it with reverence and love.

41
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:22,189
Don’t make a mess of fish too much, or trample upon it.

42
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:27,384
When a little fish comes when they drift net

43
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:37,904
Even if it’s just one, cut it well, hang it to dry, and eat it when it’s time.

44
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:47,564
However, they said that if they leave it strewn, it’ll rot if it stays there.

45
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:52,409
And the bugs, maggots, will eat it, destroying it.

46
00:04:54,364 --> 00:05:02,234
They told them not to do that out of great love for what fish they had.

47
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:08,504
When they dried, they’d store them, store them well.

48
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:14,369
They didn’t waste what fish they had.

49
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:24,264
And what they wouldn’t eat among them, they’d feed to the dogs, not leave them strewn about.

50
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:29,984
Also, they always dumped the food scraps somewhere.

51
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:36,414
Food scraps had dumping sites in the wilderness where people didn’t trod.

52
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:43,854
They wouldn’t dump them in the dumping sites for honey bucket, but there in the wilderness.

53
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:47,744
They treated fish with great love.

54
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:57,299
And since they didn’t eat Western food long ago, since it was their only food source

55
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:08,669
They instructed their youth to treath these fish with great love.

56
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:17,774
And they’d tell them not to dump them in random places, not to tread over them.

57
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:24,804
They didn’t waste what fish they had.

58
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:32,124
Now, you’re 80 years old.

59
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:37,294
Back when you started becoming observant

60
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,894
It’s clear that it wasn’t like our current day.

61
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:49,374
In our days, many things don’t need to be set out.

62
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:59,729
The changes you’ve seen in your observation, what are the biggest changes in your observation to this day?

63
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:02,444
You mean what things are like?

64
00:07:02,444 --> 00:07:07,384
Yes, what things are like, and what a person is like, what we Yupiit are like.

65
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,089
What all of us are like has changed.

66
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:17,314
We’re nothing like long ago, having become bad.

67
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:24,489
And even when we speak to our youth, they don’t listen anymore.

68
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,809
They don’t obey anymore.

69
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:33,059
They only focus on the bad things they want to do.

70
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:45,599
These boys and girls can’t follow our commandments these days.

71
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:54,814
If they want to treat their parents as we were commanded to like that

72
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:01,549
They’d live well, and would not become pregnant without husbands, wouldn’t become pregnant.

73
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:04,464
There are now many of those.

74
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:11,164
They don’t respect their parents. Though they’re told, they don’t listen anymore.

75
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:19,574
I wonder what’s making many of us young people disobedient?

76
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:28,074
Why, in your observation also, why are we so disobedient now?

77
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,089
I also think like that too.

78
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:40,619
From what? Or is it because they follow their parents?

79
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:48,019
Or do they think their [parents] do it? I have no idea what makes them like that.

80
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:58,514
You see, though we try to make our youth good, they don’t tend to turn out good.

81
00:08:58,854 --> 00:09:07,684
This alcohol also makes it worse for boys, the young ones.

82
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:14,254
When you first saw someone drunk, what did you do?

83
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:20,389
I was staring, not knowing what was going on with them acting insensibly.

84
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:29,459
Going from Bethel down there, they started doing that.

85
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:34,154
They acted senselessly and foolishly.

86
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:42,769
And we who’ve never had that didn’t know that they did.

87
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:46,159
But we would admonish them.

88
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:52,229
When they do it, though we admonish them, they don’t listen anymore

89
00:09:52,709 --> 00:10:00,709
Though we tell them not to do that, that we don’t want them to do that.

90
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:12,894
What do you want to leave with the young people?

91
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:21,039
How do you want to be remembered by your descendants?

92
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,724
What do you mean?

93
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:32,269
If you have something you’d like to leave us with, leave with us, your descendants

94
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:39,364
What is something important you can think of that you want us to remember?

95
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:45,274
I want you young people to live well.

96
00:10:45,691 --> 00:11:00,121
And when they get married, we’d want them, we want them to treat their spouses well and to love them.

97
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:11,130
Without treating them badly, also because some are abusive, we admonish our youth not to do that.

98
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:23,789
Also, if they gather food, we instruct them to take good care of what food they have.

99
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:27,860
We instruct them to do that.

100
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:34,908
We tell them to take care of those with great love so that they’ll be good.

101
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:43,041
Also, because they feed people, and give to those who have none

102
00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:51,791
Through that, we tell them to always prepare their food, what food they have, well.

103
00:11:52,972 --> 00:12:02,583
No matter what this fish is like, dry it, and prepare it well.

104
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:12,316
Dry it so that it won’t spoil or rot, and store them.

105
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:26,949
When they had caches, they’d put what fish they had into caches out of great love though they [seemed] bad.

106
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:33,872
Those were our traditional instructions.

107
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:45,829
I also tried to practice the ways and instructions of the first place I lived.

108
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:50,745
Eventually, I can’t do anything anymore and stay here now.

109
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:58,040
My body’s become weak, and I can’t work hard anymore.

110
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:01,488
Okay.

111
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:09,531
That’s it. I have no other questions. But if you want to say something to add to what you’ve said.

112
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,784
I think that’s it for me.

113
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:19,392
Well, I’m glad when we see each other.

114
00:13:20,642 --> 00:13:22,098
Yes.

115
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:28,868
I also regularly watch you on the TV here. (I see.)

116
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,082
Okay.

117
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,354
I watch you.

118
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:38,253
I think that’s it.
