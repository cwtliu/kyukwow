1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:06,900
Okay.

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:13,470
This is will be all for what I’ve just spoken about.

3
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:24,135
But also, in order to try to keep our bodies safe here on this earth

4
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,740
Yes, I’m also going to speak on how it wouldn’t get into misfortune.

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,040
Now, these days.

6
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:45,735
These rainproof clothese in the winter: rainpants, raincoat

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:55,060
Those should not be absent in the winter like this when traveling.

8
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:06,635
For this body to be good

9
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:20,845
Also through that, if we walk on this land, in the wilderness, these rainproof clothes shouldn’t be absent.

10
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,890
It’s so that this body will be good.

11
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:38,515
Then, should a person get into misfortune in the wilderness without rain gear

12
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:47,800
If the weather turns bad on them, they used to instruct us

13
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:59,770
They said that if we get lost, we shouldn’t keep going but stop.

14
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:11,865
Or if a blizzard hits us, they said that especially if we [have nothing but] what we’re standing in like this

15
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:24,790
If we travel without anything, and if we don’t have the supply tarpaulin

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,970
They used to instruct us like this:

17
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:39,020
They said if we come to misfortune, if a blizzard his us, to dig into the snow like this.

18
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:50,100
We should go in, but they’d also hold something small.

19
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:57,045
They said this walking staff would be salvation for this body.

20
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:06,990
Or, if [s]he has no staff in the winter, it [s]he holds on to a branch while going

21
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:16,720
Then when a blizzard hits and [s]he is lost, [s]he should dig and have the snow cover them.

22
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:25,875
But also, to those things, you know how we refer to those deep [hollows/depressions] as kanarvikneret.

23
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:32,155
If there’s a blizzard, and [the summit] up there is high, and this [depression] is deep

24
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:38,255
They said we shouldn’t have the snow cover us there.

25
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:46,935
Instead, they said that we should dig into a low hill

26
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:59,495
When we go in when we fit in there, we should close our entrance with snow.

27
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,800
But, they said not to get it too small.

28
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:12,610
Do this to the snow, and set this [staff] upright to pierce [the ceiling] up there.

29
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:22,395
If we get covered in snow, do this [to open it] up there.

30
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:29,975
They said if a person is airtight under snow, [s]he will suffocate.

31
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:36,155
Once, we almost suffocated inland.

32
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:44,640
There were three of us: my younger sibling, and that one who moved to Kwethluk, and me.

33
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,830
When we set up a tent in a deep [depression]

34
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:05,570
A blizzard started at night when we [set up] when it was windy like this. The weather turned bad.

35
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:13,360
I opened my eyes and felt very suffocated. I quickly got up and hit this [ceiling].

36
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:19,065
Apparently, the snow was weighing down on it like this.

37
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:25,090
We got out after much struggle then, and our things were wet.

38
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,170
And yet, the weather out there was very cold.

39
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:37,510
When it’s airtight under the snow like this, it’s evidently very hot and hard to breathe.

40
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:46,955
The snow kept melting like this and made our things, our beds, wet.

41
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,440
That’s why they would admonish us like this:

42
00:05:55,785 --> 00:06:04,705
If the weather turns bad in us, we shouldn’t shelter in deep [depressions], shouldn’t let the snow cover us.

43
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,540
Instead, [shelter] on a low hill or where it will be thin despite snowing.

44
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:20,065
Also, pierce [the ceiling] up there like this, and even move it back and forth.

45
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:30,075
Then, if we also know that we’re not going to make it back home

46
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:39,430
They said we should stick soemthing in the land toward our destination and go in.

47
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:48,220
They said that if dawn comes with good weather

48
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:56,510
We will know and not be confused, and will go to our destination over there.

49
00:06:56,945 --> 00:07:02,095
This, you see

50
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:16,255
Since noticing things is not demonstrated too much anymore, and since we don’t demonstrate it anymore

51
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,850
We’re starting not to know it like this.

52
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:24,595
We are ignorant these days.

53
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,730
That’s all for that [subject].

54
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:33,215
Then, what’s also been on my mind

55
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:44,620
Those who raised us back then didn’t keep us from knowing our relatives

56
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,020
Even if they’re in other villages somewhere.

57
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:59,980
You know, these days, they’re told those people are their [male to male] cross-cousins, maternal uncles, maternal aunts, [male to female] cross-cousins

58
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,350
Those do get pointed out.

59
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:15,545
These days, we don’t know anything like this.

60
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:28,535
Back when we were little boys like this, those who raised us back then would teach us.

61
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:39,350
And when they arrived from [other] villages like this, when these relatives arrived

62
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:42,715
They would point out to us.

63
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,270
They said we and that person are related somehow.

64
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:57,420
We’re [male to male] cross cousins, or we’re [male to female] niece/nephew, like that.

65
00:08:57,425 --> 00:09:05,925
Through that, we’d suddenly figure out [how we’re related] when they’re pointed out.

66
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:15,320
These days, however, we don’t know how we’re related like that.

67
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:27,870
And through this, not knowing how we’re related, how we’re not shown [how we’re related]

68
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,740
These days, people are starting to fight each other.

69
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:46,545
And yet, though they’re related like this, they’ fight. They’ve started fighting these days.

70
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,820
People back then were peaceful.

71
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:59,035
There was no one fighting each other.

72
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:06,665
That’s the extent of my story of that.

73
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:19,355
These days, like this, yes, we’re no longer like our ancestors of old.

74
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:30,730
Now, it’s gotten better like this. We’ve gotten better. They said we’ve gotten better these days.

75
00:10:30,735 --> 00:10:38,815
But we haven’t gotten better. We haven’t gotten better.

76
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:43,135
People back then were tight-knit.

77
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:47,295
We have gotten better without struggling for:

78
00:10:47,305 --> 00:11:00,715
These Caucasians have provided us with our clothes, our vehicles, various things, our food, and our buildings

79
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:10,565
We stopped suffering, stopped being afflicted with great cold at night, started being hot all the time.

80
00:11:11,945 --> 00:11:15,345
It had gotten better.

81
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,240
But they’ve gotten worse, we’ve gotten worse these days.

82
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:26,715
They’ve started fighting each other. They’ve started killing each other.

83
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:37,035
It went exactly as this Bible said it would.

84
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:51,515
Now, you boys and girls who are listening like this, remember what you just heard.

85
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:56,790
Those who raised us back then weren’t like this.

86
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:08,915
There weren’t a lot of accouterments in a home because their homes weren’t like this.

87
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:22,810
And when they slept at night in the extreme cold, these buckets filled with water would freeze.

88
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:31,895
And even if they were on the stove, even though those kettles had been warm, some would [end up] frozen.

89
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,340
Yes, this [is it]... (So, how...)

90
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,500
Now, your question, ask me.

91
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:53,830
You know, how to take care of men, women.

92
00:12:53,835 --> 00:13:02,645
You know, men’s traditional wisdom about owmen, you know, how men, you know, their traditional wisdom, how married couples, you know, take care of their spouses.

93
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:04,085
Okay.

94
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:12,805
Now, married couples like this, this married couple

95
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:21,975
The priest asks them a question like that.

96
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:30,295
In front of God, [s]he asks them this:

97
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:40,745
"In your marriage, will you respect each other, obey each other, obey your husband?

98
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:47,815
"Or, you who is a husband, obey your wife."

99
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:52,545
That’s how this is done

100
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,670
But we’re instructed like this:

101
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:10,120
They said this married couple, if they’re married like this and want to do well

102
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:15,495
They must obey each other like this, not disobey each other.

103
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:24,565
[S]he must watch their husband, his stomach and his possessions, and his clothes.

104
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,730
And [s]he must watch over [the animals] he catches.

105
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:40,105
Then a husband also with his wife whom he takes care of

106
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:52,545
A woman takes care of the inside of a home, the things in the home that the man caught.

107
00:14:53,190 --> 00:15:06,700
However, a husband also [works] out there, outside the house

108
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,560
Or [in] the wilderness, that’s his responsibility.

109
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:17,710
He must also watch over what he needs to take care of for his wife.

110
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:24,870
Water inside the house is a way to take care of a woman.

111
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:37,450
Then even if it’s like that, they must obey each other without being at odds with each other.

112
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:48,740
They’re admonished like this if they want to do well:

113
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,970
Couples don’t always treat each other with love.

114
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,640
But like this...

115
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,070
What do they tell them again?

116
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:11,420
They shouldn’t be at odds with each other.

117
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:21,820
If one’s spouse tells them something to make them upset

118
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:30,270
They said that for a husband, even if his wife says something to him like that

119
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:37,870
Even if it destroys his mindset, if he doesn’t do the same

120
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:44,210
If his wife has no opposition, she will stop things.

121
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,410
Then [if] the man [does the same] to the woman

122
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:00,670
If he’s not in a loving mindset or talks about her behavior

123
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:09,960
They said the woman shouldn’t misunderstand like that, and not make herself an opponent.

124
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:15,290
People in any relationship who are at odds cannoy stay together.

125
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:27,090
Or if siblings do not interact with each other well, they cannot stay together.

126
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:42,832
Then if this married couple is like that, if they are at odds with other, they won’t do well.

127
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,500
And especially when they bring forth a child

128
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:57,420
They said with that, that was something we were especially strongly admonished with.

129
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,540
They told us not to have them come to us when we upset if we have children.

130
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:13,130
They said that these children are not ignorant like this.

131
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:20,490
And the ones I watched back then weren’t like this.

132
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:35,040
You know, they didn’t, you know, they wouldn’t argue about their thoughts in our presence.

133
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:39,670
These days, however, what did they become?

134
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:52,380
And even if there’s a lot of people, if this married couple wants to speak badly, they will angrily argue.

135
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:02,380
These days, we know what causes too much destruction.

136
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:15,370
This, what they’re abusing these days, alcohol is what destroys a married couple.

137
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:27,650
And even if there’s a lot of people, when they start abusing that, they divorce.

138
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,360
It’s a source of great destruction.

139
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:41,260
And yet, our instructors here and our [Caucasian] counterparts are working on it.

140
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:48,500
Since it’s what they [brought], they’re working on it.

141
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:58,430
These days, this alcohol torments them.

142
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:09,930
People back then didn’t do this, the ones I just talked about.

143
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:21,720
They never killed their wives. They never raised their hands against their children.

144
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:31,340
These days, it’s the cause of destruction for married couples.

145
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:40,650
You just asked me what a married couple must be like.

146
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:48,520
They will live well if they don’t [abuse] anything.
