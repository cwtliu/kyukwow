1
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:23,450
And I knew about worry, 16, as a girl I would be the one to go to each house.

2
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:28,785
I would think that. Then one day, I agreed.

3
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:35,905
Oh my, I married him and found that I was reserved towards him out of respect.

4
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,130
I would lay next to him like this with all of my clothes.

5
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:47,405
You know, they take off their clothes and put on gowns or something to go to bed now.

6
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:52,715
I would go to bed by my spouse with all of my clothes.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,750
You see, I would go to my family out there and my husband was inside

8
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,770
In there [?] you know the ones that split up there.

9
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:10,705
When I would go downriver to my family, I would not want to go back, you know, not want to return.

10
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:14,115
My mother would say to me, "Go back already."

11
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:22,065
I would go out when I was tired. My mind would be smashed as they say in English.

12
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,015
Poor me, I would go upriver to my husband’s house.

13
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:37,190
I would go in and it would be completely silent.  I would go in and he had already gone to bed. I was so disrespectful. I was so disrespectful.

14
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:46,035
And since I knew that my husband was laying there, I would lay next to him with all of my clothes.

15
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:50,360
Ooh my, when I married and they got me, I would go in

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:59,890
These days, a man takes a wife without giving anything to his wife.

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,790
I went in, I think they used to do it a long time ago.

18
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,590
There were two huge cardboard boxes.

19
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:17,915
And then that girl, my husband’s older brother’s child, would take something out, their mother’s mattress.

20
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:23,965
They were beautiful accessories for beds, all new blankets.

21
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:27,435
That was the start of my beginning.

22
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:32,335
They would give things like that.

23
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,340
That girl started giving me things from those boxes.

24
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:43,865
She took out and gave me an atkuk, a fur parka.

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,270
You know that fur parkas are expensive these days.

26
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,980
And they were overwhelming.

27
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:56,895
She gave me a parka, put it next to me, and I wasn’t thankful.

28
00:02:56,955 --> 00:03:00,175
You know, I didn’t want a husband.

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,600
After that, she also took out piluguuk (2), fur mukluks.

30
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:09,965
She took them and put them next to me.

31
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:15,355
She did that with many things.

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,300
There you go.

33
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:25,445
And then, my husband didn’t do that with his family like that.

34
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:34,150
They took me in the fall. The next spring, I wanted to be with my family. I used to do that.

35
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:41,755
And when I wanted to go home, my husband wanted to move me to Up’nerkilleq, but I refused.

36
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,550
He left without me.

37
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:50,165
And then I became happy with my family.

38
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:59,830
He came in the spring, and they told me that my husband was going to come and move in with my family.

39
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,620
When he did that, I was, you know, thankful.

40
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,040
That’s right, my mother would tell me, "He will provide for us."

41
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:14,015
He was going to come and move to take care of us.

42
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:23,385
Because I knew that, you know, I started treated him well, also because I would keep my back to him before.

43
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:29,895
And I started looking at him sometimes. He was very intimidating.

44
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,300
They must have respected each other. I, at least, did that.

45
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,560
And then he moved in with us.

46
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,920
Oh my, I didn’t get pregnant right away.

47
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,220
Because I wouldn’t let him touch me as I went to bed and closed off my mind.

48
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:18,715
And some mornings, my mother would say this to me: "Do not suddenly raise your hand."

49
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,310
You know, men probably know that women raise their hands in certain ways.

50
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:35,310
Sometimes when he brought his arm like this, I would do this out of dislike for him.

51
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:39,755
My mother would say, "They don’t do that." I didn’t know.

52
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,660
Everything has ayuqucirtuutet, rules.

53
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:49,295
She said they don’t do that.

54
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:54,225
She said a man takes a wife for fun.

55
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:57,885
I would be hit with fear.

56
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,260
And then I was pregnant with Robert Nick, Yuukaq, who’s inland.

57
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:09,680
I got pregnant. When I was pregnant, I could finally face my husband for long periods of time.

58
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,590
Nick turned out to be very good.

59
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:23,205
And then when I was pregnant like that, I finally started observing him reading the Bible.

60
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,750
My husband was always working hard.

61
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:35,900
The one my parents chose turned out to be a hard worker.

62
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:44,200
He started reading the Bible. He would read the Bible every evening.

63
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,830
Then we had two childrenb, Robert and Margaret I think.

64
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,005
He became a pastor at a young age.

65
00:06:55,715 --> 00:07:01,315
It’s very nice. I can say how nice it is.

66
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,275
He wouldn’t frolick. We used to frolick.

67
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,610
Now, there are places to play like the Teen Center, and others.

68
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,835
When I would play in them, I would never see the one who’d become my husband.

69
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:24,665
Since he was like that from the beginning, my parents wanted me to be with him.

70
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,230
He started reading the Bible.

71
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:35,520
And before long, they made him a pastor. He became a pastor in Nunapitchuk at a young age.

72
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,200
And he just died as he was still a pastor.

73
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:43,815
And we had nine children.

74
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:48,035
Wow, he was so dedicated to that.

75
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:54,625
And as he was a pastor, he built that little store inland.

76
00:07:54,785 --> 00:08:06,045
Before he made it, he said that he first went to the pastors, the Moravian pastors, and went to the pastor in Kwethluk.

77
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,650
He was extremely knowledgable with absolutely no Western education.

78
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:23,275
He asked if he could work at the store alongside being a pastor.

79
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,660
And they gave him the okay.

80
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:37,130
That building inland, Nick O. Nick Trading Post, was built only after being reviewed by the knowledgable priests here.

81
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:11,050
And then we raised our children like that.

82
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:17,115
And we never did this even once with alcohol.

83
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:23,485
We used to travel over to the city several times after he had built the store.

84
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:34,080
Some are very smart, are destined to be smart, even if they have absolutely no Western education.

85
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:40,775
I am not praising him, but speaking of him as an example.

86
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:52,500
When we used to go to the city, it turned out that Caucasians use a little alcohol in their friendly social interactions.

87
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:57,445
And then when someone comes in, "You want a drink?"

88
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:08,070
We would go around over there in his colleagues’ businesses.

89
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:15,660
And when we came in after he made himself comfortable, "Nick you want a drink?" they would ask him. "No."

90
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,820
When he said "No," the smart ones would say, "Sorry."

91
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:23,905
"I’m sorry, Nick."

92
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,690
After that, they would say afterwards, "Nick, you’re lucky." They would say that to him.

93
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,460
I will not keep from speaking about what I said because they’re good.

94
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:13,155
When we were boys in the fall like this upriver in Kialiq

95
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:20,430
They said that the creek upriver at the mouth of Kialiq was named Qukaqlircaraq.

96
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,860
We used to live there.

97
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:36,355
But our caretakers would not live in the same area in the fall like this.

98
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:45,230
Or, they would also stay in one area like this without traveling.

99
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:59,747
Towards fall, when they came from the fish camps across there in the fall

100
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,858
They would gather wood.

101
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:10,192
And they didn’t have boats, but traveled by kayak.

102
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:25,183
Since the tide would come in high in the morning during fall, they would start traveling in the morning in the dark.

103
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:37,461
Sometimes, however, a kayak would appear through Cingik downriver towing wood behind.

104
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:58,419
During the fall like this, when they were going to go the headwaters of rivers to their winter camps, they would gather those.

105
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:10,434
Our ancestors, those who raised us, were not like how we are here.

106
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:22,342
They would travel by straining their own arms, rowing through the water.

107
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:33,763
And when it was time for them, they started going upriver.

108
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:48,053
They would bring the wood with them, then put their possessions on top as cargo.

109
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,128
Those without boats would move with wood.

110
00:13:54,531 --> 00:14:05,131
And then when they reached the headwaters of the rivers where they would camp for the winter, they would bring the wood inland.

111
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:20,281
Then they would prepare. They would prepare the wood to make their fishing implements, their fish traps.

112
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:51,699
They would make the wood into big fish traps.

113
00:14:52,774 --> 00:15:03,674
Big fish traps were like this. Their openings were wide and long.

114
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:13,540
And they were like this, what they called the inner funnel.

115
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:22,201
And then they would also make the middle of the fish traps by enlarging them like this.

116
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:28,177
And then they would set the third one over there.

117
00:15:28,713 --> 00:15:35,898
They called those original fish traps qamut.

118
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:43,642
These big fish traps were not like, you know, blackfish traps.

119
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,180
And, you know, their gaps were this wide.

120
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:56,660
They made wide gaps, yes, they had a procedures to make those big fish traps.

121
00:15:57,197 --> 00:16:08,154
After measuring these, they would put the split spruce, put it there.

122
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:18,655
And then after doing this, they would make certain gaps like this on the side for those big fish traps.

123
00:16:20,824 --> 00:16:28,367
When they started working on them like this, their hands would get raw.

124
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:35,874
They would use twine for the things they worked on like this.

125
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:44,748
Instead, they would thinly split these pieces of wood

126
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:50,686
There were about this wide, but thin.

127
00:16:50,783 --> 00:17:00,769
They also had procedures for making those. They measured the thickness.

128
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:10,992
When they started doing that, they become raw here from doing this.

129
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:24,132
When they started bleeding, they would wrap these three with skin

130
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:27,707
When these became raw.

131
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:35,470
These too, these would get raw from gripping.

132
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:43,657
Our ancestors back then were not like us.

133
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:50,385
They had wooden possessions.

134
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:58,129
That wood was used for their possessions and tools.

135
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:09,820
They used for their things, houses, things around their houses, and sleds.

136
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:15,579
They survived by using this wood.

137
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:46,740
Let me talk about the traditional wisdom I grew up with.

138
00:18:46,780 --> 00:19:00,165
I grew up where we alone had a settlement inland in the wilderness or downriver at the mouth of Tagyaraq.

139
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:12,523
But when I was a girl, we would be in the fish camps in the summer, then in the wilderness inland in the fall with no one around us.

140
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:17,623
And downriver at Tagyaraq in the winter, there was no one around us.

141
00:19:17,668 --> 00:19:23,383
But we would start seeing people when we went to fish camp.

142
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:32,912
And I stayed with my grandmother because my grandmother raised me, because my grandparents raised me.

143
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:41,586
However, I lived with two other women. We were a family.

144
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:53,970
And then my grandmother would tell us and admonish us in the morning when we got up not to fight each other. She told us not to fight each other.

145
00:19:54,051 --> 00:20:03,780
We little family who were in that house did not fight as a small family.

146
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:11,146
She would tell us to instead do our chores and help each other without fighting.

147
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:21,215
And then when we went there to a populated place, she would also say this to me when I was going to go out in the morning:

148
00:20:21,235 --> 00:20:32,964
If the people outside picked on me, and if they picked on me as we were playing, I should run awy. She told me not to retaliate.

149
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:36,935
Then she would also say this to me:

150
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:49,769
Even if a person wrongs me, do not retaliate, but I should treat all my peers with love, always with love. We should treat each other with love. She said we should treat all of our peers with love.

151
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:59,677
When I was a girl, when we were girls, she would speak to us about how we should behave for the day.

152
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:05,611
That why we feared her because it seemed that she was scolding us.

153
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:14,178
When we didn’t adhere to her wisdom, my grandmother would shout at us as if scolding us.

154
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:21,284
That’s why we were scared of disregarding her wisdom.

155
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:30,389
She would instruct us to treat each other with love like that, always treat each other with love and never fight our peers.

156
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:37,571
And no matter what anyone does to us, never to retaliate.

157
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:09,699
She said that we should be hard working. She also said not to visit all the time.

158
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:16,372
She said that if we visit people too much, we will get hurt someday.

159
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:21,498
She said that if we visit too often, we will get hurt someday.

160
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:29,487
And then she said that if we visit other people too much, our things will deplete.

161
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:35,096
She said that our things will deplete when we should have been working.

162
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:51,868
And then she talked about little things since we are all women. Back when I was growing up, people would take these grass and weave them.

163
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,722
They would make containers for the fish they caught in the summer.

164
00:22:58,348 --> 00:23:04,134
And they would pair king salmon and cover them with tall cottongrass.

165
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:12,249
She said that if we do not prepare, it would be certain what we’ll do: we will ask for things from our neighbors.

166
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:18,352
If we don’t gather tall cottongrass to hang fish in pairs, we will ask for things.

167
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:25,814
She said that if we do not save things, we will be beggers. That’s what she would tell us.

168
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:30,654
We were poor. There was nothing pre-made when we grew up.

169
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:42,064
And then she would tell us... it was like how it is now when we were growing up. I haven’t become an extremely old woman yet.

170
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:51,739
But when I was growing up, since I grew up with those old people, they seemed to be very old-fashioned.

171
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:59,363
That’s what she would tell us. If we don’t save things, we will be beggers.

172
00:24:01,063 --> 00:24:14,692
And she said that if we’re going to see, see how it’s not scarce these days, if we’re going to sew and we do not save things, we will beg from our neighbors.

173
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:25,941
Or she said that we might borrow even a needle, or we would beg if we didn’t save things. That’s how poor we were.

174
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,931
That’s why we respected the traditional wisdom passed down to us.

175
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:05,161
If we see a little fish, this little bit of fish is the first.

176
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:16,446
If we see a little fish, she said that we should accept it without thinking it’s too little. We should hang and dry it.

177
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:21,468
She said that it would become food if we hang and dry it.

178
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:29,210
In the summer like this, she said that we should cut even a single little fish and hang it to dry.

179
00:25:29,514 --> 00:25:34,171
And then she said that when it dries, we can eat it dried and boiled.

180
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:48,861
However, she said that if we think it’s too little and ignore it, the worms will eat it, the worms will destroy it, flies lay eggs on it, and it will get worms so it’s no longer edible.

181
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,919
It will no longer be edible.

182
00:25:51,936 --> 00:26:01,608
That’s why she said that we should store even a little bit of fish. She said it would be food even if it’s not much.

183
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:05,079
That’s what they used to tell us.

184
00:26:05,093 --> 00:26:19,279
And then she said that should we get a hunter, since we’re all women, even if there’s a lot of food to process, a woman should not be overwhelmed by them.

185
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:29,358
She said that she shouldn’t be overwhelmed and do a sloppy job. She said she should thoroughly dry it.

186
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:36,058
She also said not to dump food scraps to places where people trod, but to where people do not trod.

187
00:26:36,098 --> 00:26:41,927
She said that food scraps are eyesores when they’re a mess on the ground here.

188
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:49,799
She said we suffer without food, when the stomach has nothing. These are the wisdom passed down to us.

189
00:26:51,036 --> 00:26:58,364
She said that it’s worse having an empty stomach than any sickness.

190
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:03,159
That’s why even a little fish, this is our traditional wisdom.

191
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:09,495
That’s why she said not to despise a little fish even if it’s bad, but to save it.

192
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:13,251
She said we won’t dislike anything if our stomachs are empty.

193
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,571
This is the traditional wisdom passed down to us when we were young.

194
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:25,399
And she said not to litter with that little fish, but to throw it where people have not trod.

195
00:27:25,762 --> 00:27:31,048
And she told us to throw the slop from cutting fish to where people have not trod.

196
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:36,971
She said that since a little fish is the backbone of a person, it should not be disregarded.

197
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,624
She also told us to eat without disliking anything.

198
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:50,521
She said that if food is scarce, we will not dislike or reject anything, since a person truly will not reject anything if he is hungry.

199
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:26,640
Well, back when we were growing up, when a person was suffering in sickness and was on the verge of death

200
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,371
We people would stop going into that house from outside.

201
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:40,400
And then after that person was sick for a long time, since our ancestors’ bodies were strong back then

202
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:49,906
When he died, his caretakers would prepare him, taking him down from somewhere here.

203
00:28:50,306 --> 00:29:06,749
They would clothe them, put on their parkas, some of them boots, some of them sealskin boots, put some seal gut rain parkas on some of the men, some of them fish skin gloves, and some of them fur gloves.

204
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:20,141
They would sit them down down there with two wooden supports. They would sit down like this with their faces showing so that they were airtight.

205
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:28,253
However, they would light a little oil lamp in front of them because those were the only light they had.

206
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:39,131
The people who wanted to from the houses outside would bring him food by putting a bowl down there in front of him.

207
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:45,178
They said they would do that to feed their dead.

208
00:29:45,187 --> 00:30:02,602
And then when his casket inland was done, they would tie him with five ties and lay him down, attach ropes, and take him out through the smokehole up there.

209
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:05,812
And they wouldn’t do it through the door, but through the smokehole.

210
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,748
And when they took him out, they would place him by revolving him around the corners.

211
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:15,313
That’s what they did with them.

212
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:53,089
And then they said that should we marry and take care of a child

213
00:30:54,571 --> 00:31:05,300
They also said not to push them to our husbands. They said that that man travels, he is a traveler.

214
00:31:05,717 --> 00:31:12,031
That’s why we should not push that child unto that man.

215
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:21,250
They said that when we cannot get out of the situation, he will have to entertain the child since a married couple are supposed to help each other.

216
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:27,235
But they said that he’s a traveler. We should not let him take care of the child.

217
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:31,771
They said that he would be sad when he leaves.

218
00:31:31,821 --> 00:31:37,364
It will be bad when he’s sad over his father traveling.

219
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:50,447
They said that he will eventually start worrying about the child he left behind and have bad trips if he keeps being sad over his father leaving.

220
00:31:50,624 --> 00:32:00,539
They would admonish us against pushing our children to the husband when we have children.

221
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:14,689
And then when we raise our children, they also said that since we are the ones who stay in the house to take care of them unlike the traveling men

222
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:21,685
They said that we should always watch our children in the house.

223
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:28,275
And they said not to excessively react to them when they’re mischievous.

224
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:34,965
They said that they worsen when we get too exasperated with them.

225
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:45,400
They also said that in reprimanding, we don’t need to add to our voices. Do not hit our child. Do not hit him.

226
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,719
They said that if we hit him, he will become overconfident.

227
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:56,976
They also said that if we shout at them too much, he’ll be overconfident. They said we’ll make our child overconfident.

228
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:02,389
That’s included in women’s traditional wisdom.

229
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:10,170
They said that we will make our child overconfident if we shout at them too much.

230
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:15,856
He will behave badly, being disobedient though we admonish him.

231
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:24,366
And if he’s mischievous, if we react too excessively, his mischievous behavior will get worse.

232
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:30,637
That’s why they say it’s better to encourage a child.

233
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:38,545
And then they said that when we reprimand them, they said that all people can be irritating.

234
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:44,121
They said that they don’t always treat a child with love. They reprimand him when he becomes tiresome.

235
00:33:44,146 --> 00:33:47,446
They said that we will reprimand them.

236
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:52,102
THey said that after reprimanding him, do not laugh but leave him be.

237
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:56,789
Leave him alone without saying anything if we reprimand him.

238
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:03,079
Only when he gets better, speak well to him after reprimanding him.

239
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:09,983
If he cries, do laugh at him like that after reprimanding him.

240
00:34:09,986 --> 00:34:14,143
They said that he will become bad if we laugh at him.

241
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:19,170
They also say that children who are laughed at become bad.

242
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:31,154
THey would include that in the things we should do when we raise that child in the house

243
00:34:31,814 --> 00:34:38,843
Because it’s not easy to raise a child.

244
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:47,794
It’s hard work. We worked hard back then when we raised our children.

245
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,482
And they were not like how it is now when we raised our children.

246
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:58,661
We didn’t keep throwing diapers away.

247
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:02,143
That’s why we had a lot of traditional wisdom.

248
00:35:02,164 --> 00:35:05,478
And if we sleep too much, they would urinate on us.

249
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:12,520
That child will urinate on his mat and urinate on us, and it will smell like urine.

250
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:15,114
Now you try to be spick and span.

251
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:22,701
They said that if we sleep too much, our house will smell like our child’s urine

252
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:26,298
Because we don’t let them relieve themselves at night.

253
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:32,796
Waking from our sleep, we would have our children urinate in the urine buckets at night.

254
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:37,702
And when we got up, we would take his urine bucket, go out, and dump it.

255
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:45,183
And we would always wash their reusable diapers because they didn’t have a lot

256
00:35:45,191 --> 00:35:53,248
Because they would run out of diapers, we who didn’t have a lot would wash them later.

257
00:35:53,741 --> 00:35:57,269
That is our traditional wisdom.

258
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:28,711
And then love is also an important part of traditional wisdom.

259
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:35,383
No matter what our peers do to us, never retaliate.

260
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:42,886
Then if a visitor comes, be sociable with him even if you don’t know where he’s from.

261
00:36:43,053 --> 00:36:45,353
I was very shy.

262
00:36:45,823 --> 00:37:03,866
I would be very daunted when they said this to me: "Even if you see him for the first time, socialie with him. And even if you see a guest for the first time, welcome him with your mouth and talk to him if you don’t have anything else, or feed him if there’s enough for him."

263
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,628
I was very shy.

264
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:17,102
They said that through socializing by talking or feeding him, a person becomes a close friend.

265
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:21,372
They become friends with those they socialized with.

266
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:28,618
They say that some people are daunted when going to villages, and it’s true.

267
00:37:31,137 --> 00:37:40,508
Those things that we talked about are true, that it’s difficult to go to places where one has not gone before.

268
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:48,951
That is why we must give a warm welcome to someone we don’t know whom we’ve never seen anywhere before.

269
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:54,855
They said that he is daunted since he doesn’t know where he’s going.

270
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:59,007
He’s daunted by that village because he doesn’t know the place he’s going to.

271
00:37:59,317 --> 00:38:05,960
That’s what it’s like. When we travel where we haven’t before, we’re daunted.

272
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:11,208
That’s why you young people should remember this.

273
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:20,503
Also, even if what family you have does anything to you, never retaliate with their wrong against you as your motive.

274
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:27,786
We were also told to respect our parents.

275
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:33,375
That’s why to you who still have parents, these are the wisdom passed down to me.

276
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:42,203
We must defer to our parents, respect them, and try to adhere to their traditional wisdom.

277
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:45,776
That’s what we were told.

278
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,697
That’s why we respected those who raised us.

279
00:38:51,137 --> 00:38:56,380
This is the traditional passed down to me when I was growing up.

280
00:38:56,738 --> 00:39:01,852
Our traditional wisdom, there is a lot of wisdom for a person.

281
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:06,266
There is traditional wisdom for everything.

282
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:13,824
If we spoke about them, we would speak a lot. There is traditional wisdom for everything.

283
00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:22,743
Those are the important wisdom that was passed down to me, how to take care of fish

284
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:27,295
And loving our peers no matter what they do to us

285
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:32,731
And not retaliating no matter what anyone does to us.

286
00:39:57,968 --> 00:40:10,640
I would pass down what will never cease to you, my grandchildren, if you would remember it, I would pass down traditional wisdom to you.

287
00:40:12,718 --> 00:40:18,461
I just said that you must love your peers.

288
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:28,497
Treat even those who do wrong to you with love. And do not do the same to those who wrong you, but treat them with love.

289
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:33,934
This love is what you must pass down.

290
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:41,444
Then, love your peers, and depend on your god.

291
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:45,899
Now, I am passing it on to you, my grandchildren.

292
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:50,509
And then my grandchildren down there, your relatives down there

293
00:40:51,984 --> 00:41:00,564
I tell every one of them, teaching them so that they would pass down the traditional wisdom.

294
00:41:00,779 --> 00:41:06,949
Even if I go and you do not see my, I want you to remember it.

295
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:18,039
I tell them at the dawn of every day to treat their families, their siblings, with love, or even if they’re not siblings

296
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:23,094
Or to never retaliate no matter what their peers do to them.

297
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:28,544
Also, I tell them not to speak harshly.

298
00:41:29,174 --> 00:41:33,034
You know, not to speak without thinking.

299
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:39,399
If you speak without thinking, you will regret it someday.

300
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:43,989
You must remember that which I passed down to you.

301
00:41:46,419 --> 00:41:53,419
Even if I go from here, you must remember them. That is how I pass them down.

302
00:42:17,464 --> 00:42:27,944
Women would separately prepare their men before it froze like this.

303
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:32,809
Clothes and skin boots for them.

304
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:42,079
And these fish skins like this, the king salmon skins

305
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:46,724
They called it preparing fish skins.

306
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:51,254
That’s what they did when they made them fish skin boots.

307
00:42:51,624 --> 00:43:02,674
Also, they wouldn’t just remove the flesh

308
00:43:02,904 --> 00:43:12,964
When they finished removing the flesh, they wouldn’t work on them right away

309
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:24,659
They would submerge the fish skins into urine like this.

310
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:29,279
They removed the fish smell.

311
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:36,364
When they were aging urine, as they called it

312
00:43:38,894 --> 00:43:50,504
Their men would urinate into those containers, their original containers.

313
00:43:50,514 --> 00:43:53,174
They called that aging urine.

314
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:56,679
Those would smell very strong.

315
00:43:57,389 --> 00:44:04,959
They would submerge the fish skins into those.

316
00:44:05,189 --> 00:44:13,839
And then after soaking them, they would scrape them.

317
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:22,749
After working on them with boards, hang them outside and dry them.

318
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:35,979
Then when they’re dry, them make those into skin boots for their men.

319
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:40,994
They said they made them fish skin boots for their travels.

320
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:11,009
Their men would also prepare.

321
00:45:12,499 --> 00:45:20,869
When they no longer needed those big fish traps that are used to catch blackfish

322
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:31,289
When they were going to change from the blackfish

323
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:40,089
They would also make those fish traps.

324
00:45:44,384 --> 00:45:50,484
And then when they started setting them

325
00:45:51,439 --> 00:46:04,729
These days, we store blackfish in various things like boxes and burlap bags.

326
00:46:05,659 --> 00:46:14,599
However, our caretakers that I observed back then didn’t have those.

327
00:46:40,404 --> 00:46:53,144
Their women also used to prepare containers for them with that grass

328
00:46:53,149 --> 00:46:59,739
When they weren’t green like this anymore, when they were getting pale.

329
00:47:00,049 --> 00:47:03,819
They gathered a lot like this.

330
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:10,989
And in the summer like this...

331
00:47:11,904 --> 00:47:14,224
I forgot to say something.

332
00:47:14,729 --> 00:47:26,909
Those women would prepare that grass to use for stitching, what they would use for stitching.

333
00:47:29,464 --> 00:47:41,414
Those who raised us back then always did things for the future that they were heading towards.

334
00:47:41,574 --> 00:47:48,834
They always prepared what they would need even if the time they would need it was far ahead in the future.

335
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:58,059
It was because they didn’t have anything else. What they had was only from the land here.

336
00:48:00,024 --> 00:48:05,154
They did that because they couldn’t afford not to.

337
00:48:07,204 --> 00:48:14,614
They would prepare what they would need way ahead of time.

338
00:48:15,344 --> 00:48:23,584
They would gather tall cottongrass in the summer for stitching.

339
00:48:23,929 --> 00:48:28,019
When the women started gathering those tall cottongrass

340
00:48:28,149 --> 00:48:35,449
And then they would spread them out like this to dry them, as they called it.

341
00:48:35,814 --> 00:48:49,004
And then when they were dried, nalaluteng as they called it, they wouldn’t gather them, but weave them.

342
00:48:50,584 --> 00:48:53,634
Then when they were finished, they rolled them up.

343
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:59,364
That’s what they did with that grass they used for stitching.

344
00:49:00,779 --> 00:49:08,149
These days, when I remember those things that we did back then

345
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:14,499
Even I find it difficult to imagine doing that.

346
00:49:47,964 --> 00:49:52,244
And then their men

347
00:49:55,429 --> 00:50:07,779
They would also make these mink traps that are shaped like fish traps.

348
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:19,269
They would make them small, about this long, and then about this size. They would measure the creeks to make traps.

349
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:26,919
They also didn’t do th ose haphazardly, but had measurements.

350
00:50:27,634 --> 00:50:33,844
And their inner funnels here were not like blackfish traps.

351
00:50:33,974 --> 00:50:41,294
They would be like this, then it woud be like a den on the side.

352
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:53,959
When I would watch my older sister’s husband like this

353
00:50:54,339 --> 00:51:06,349
He would do this with his hands to measure the entrance, what they call the igyaraq.

354
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:11,039
That’s what they were like, not made haphazardly.

355
00:51:11,674 --> 00:51:23,154
And then when he made fish trap shaped land otter traps, he would make the entrance like before

356
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:33,339
And then he would do this with his hands and measure the width with his thumb.

357
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:42,394
Those were also not made haphazardly like that.

358
00:52:11,664 --> 00:52:23,284
They would also tell them not to make too much noise in the wilderness when it’s dangerous like this.

359
00:52:24,049 --> 00:52:26,409
They told them not to make too much noise like this.

360
00:52:26,514 --> 00:52:39,784
They would only make noise over those who’ve gotten into accidents, such as if someone drowned.

361
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:51,514
They would also admonish us against shouting or making noise in the wilderness in the fall like this.

362
00:52:55,134 --> 00:53:03,024
They said that only those in dire situations would make noise like that.

363
00:53:03,234 --> 00:53:15,834
And then if they hear someone making noise, shouting, they would understand that he has gotten into an accident or has sunk into water.

364
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:35,231
These days, however, since they are no longer admonished, since we no longer admonish you, they do not act appropriately.

365
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:46,040
And they now make noise and shout like this between villages.

366
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,550
They used to admonish against that.

367
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:26,725
Also, when they were going to travel like this

368
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:37,720
They would always say the area they were going to.

369
00:54:41,418 --> 00:54:56,151
And when they didn’t return like this, they would know that they had gotten into an accident.

370
00:55:00,073 --> 00:55:10,088
These days, however, they do not say anything when they’re going to travel by boat.

371
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:21,228
And then when they don’t return, they don’t know what happened because they didn’t say anything.

372
00:55:22,776 --> 00:55:28,262
It’s because they go to random places these days.

373
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:35,770
Or, they pretend to go somewhere and end up traveling to other villages.

374
00:55:36,247 --> 00:55:42,632
That’s what’s making us so addled these days.

375
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:53,830
We don’t know what’s going with the latest generation.

376
00:55:54,363 --> 00:55:56,835
Or, we think they’re someplace.

377
00:55:58,264 --> 00:56:07,878
Even when they die in the wilderness these days, we have no idea about them.

378
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:50,411
The young people these days have completely left behind what we were like before we were young, these young descendants of ours.

379
00:56:50,758 --> 00:56:54,329
They’re worse because they don’t lack anything.

380
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:59,468
Because we lacked everything when we were young.

381
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:04,491
We lacked clothes, all food, and everything.

382
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:12,241
However, these boys, our descandants, these days are like they don’t know anything at all.

383
00:57:12,253 --> 00:57:16,668
They don’t know how our ancestors survived.

384
00:57:17,524 --> 00:57:24,724
It’s because they’ve started taking anything they want and need.

385
00:57:24,729 --> 00:57:32,820
In the past, we only traveled by rowing kayaks.

386
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:38,113
I never saw motors even once back then.

387
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:41,168
And we had mud houses.

388
00:57:41,505 --> 00:57:46,768
And I never saw a Caucasian even once. The Caucasians completely missed us.

389
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:55,910
These days, however, since there are a lot of Caucasians now, these young boys have become strange.

390
00:57:56,857 --> 00:58:03,503
This alcohol especially affects them. Alcohol makes them foolish.

391
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:14,285
He sometimes destroys his mind when he does that too much, when they do too much wrong in this day that God gave.

392
00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:18,227
My mindset is destroyed when I don’t speak on that.

393
00:58:18,586 --> 00:58:23,041
Also, when they heavily scold in the name of our lord.

394
00:58:23,453 --> 00:58:30,290
For those, my mind sometimes wants to speak thinking like this:

395
00:58:30,455 --> 00:58:36,874
"We were not made for ourselves. God made us. It’ll be okay if I don’t do that."

396
00:59:08,903 --> 00:59:18,565
Now, all you boys who hear and are listening now, remember this:

397
00:59:19,004 --> 00:59:28,422
"You were not born of yourself. God, instead, made you, and had you born to be his child.

398
00:59:28,687 --> 00:59:36,824
"However, you stray by yourself. You also bring yourself to misfortune.

399
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:49,923
"No person will shelter you as you live aside from him. Only God will shelter you if you boys ask for it."

400
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:56,010
Let me tell all of you who are listening now. Hear me.

401
00:59:56,183 --> 01:00:03,383
Back before we had these Western things, every single person was extremely good.

402
01:00:04,615 --> 01:00:13,365
They wouldn’t hear about saddening news or, you know, people going missing.

403
01:00:13,706 --> 01:00:23,551
Now, however, to you boys who are listening now, everything has become commonplace.

404
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:31,599
Every single thing has become commonplace, even misplacing something in a random place.

405
01:00:31,812 --> 01:00:34,890
When it’s put, it’s already as good as gone.

406
01:00:35,171 --> 01:00:40,982
If you remember that God made it, you would live by ignoring those.

407
01:00:41,586 --> 01:00:47,342
Now, try to live righteously from this very moment.
