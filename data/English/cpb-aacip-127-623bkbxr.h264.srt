1
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,340
Ready? (Yes.) Okay.

2
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,330
You see, Yupiit had these two pieces of traditional wisdom

3
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:46,790
How a person should subsist, and what to do when hungry without food.

4
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,050
They’d always talk to us about those.

5
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:08,005
From what I’ve heard:

6
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:38,835
"I wish I’d ate that instead of throwing it away."

7
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,830
They said watch, that’s what it’s like.

8
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:50,729
[S]he starts desiring everything in their mind in hunger like this.

9
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:03,711
Those with various edible foods.

10
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:12,807
That’s why if a person doesn’t know it’s name, though that river is shown to have fish, [s]he doesn’t know it.

11
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:31,605
Hunting grounds, subsistence areas, these are part of our traditional wisdom.

12
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:39,931
However, we also need to point out ones that are never without fish.

13
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:43,836
"Ecuilnguq upriver is never without fish."

14
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:50,669
"I also hear that around Qagatmiut inland, it’s never without fish."

15
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:57,343
They told us to also subsist there.

16
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:39,164
Back then, we were also instructed to always observe those foxes, and those ravens.

17
00:06:39,262 --> 00:06:41,612
You see, this is our traditional wisdom.

18
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:51,639
Truly, foxes show [where there’s] fish. Ravens also show [where there’s fish].

19
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:59,353
We’d go to it to find so many blackfish, and then we set fish traps.

20
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:38,671
Someday, you see, since there is much [potential for] misfortune among us

21
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:52,114
"Because you helped me back when I was desperate, I am helping you with what little I have."
