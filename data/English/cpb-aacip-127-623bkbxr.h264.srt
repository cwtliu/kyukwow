1
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,340
Now? Okay. 

2
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:25,315
A long time ago in the qasgiq, young men like us stayed in the qasgiq

3
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:31,455
We stayed with all the adults who lived in the qasgiq

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,330
These were what those elders talked about most

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:46,790
Of people striving to survive, and of going hungry with no food to eat.

6
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,050
They talked to us about those many times.

7
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:59,055
Also if we are struggling, out there while hunting and gathering, to help others.

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,140
These 3 especially are rules to follow

9
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:08,005
This is what I heard:

10
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:16,980
If I come across someone in trouble while traveling

11
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,540
I am to help them out as much as I can  with what I have.

12
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:30,470
We were advised that way. If they don’t have ammunition or food to eat, to share what I have with them. 

13
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:43,480
They also told us like this: some day when we have nothing

14
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:54,740
They told us that an empty stomach is no fun. 

15
00:01:55,085 --> 00:02:02,165
Of all things that a person suffers, 

16
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:09,247
Nothing compares to the pain of an empty stomach. 


17
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:13,937
A person who is hungry cannot be strong.

18
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:27,348
Also if a person has wasted some food in the past or thrown away some food

19
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:34,039
The thought of that will haunt a person and he will regret “Arenqiapaa (unhappy exclamation like oh no or too bad.)

20
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:38,835
“I should’ve ate that food and not thrown it away!”

21
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,830
They said that is how it is.

22
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:50,729
In his mind everything starts looking good enough to eat because he is so hungry.

23
00:02:50,982 --> 00:02:58,842
These things especially were taught to us.

24
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:14,477
Also in the winter, during the cold weather when we are hunting, that is when we struggle.

25
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:19,326
They told us not to travel empty handed. 

26
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:25,888
They told us to never travel without a shovel and an ice pick.

27
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:34,176
Also to have names for rivers and creeks.

28
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:48,102
They said that a person, during a time of want, will stand by a river or creek that has a lot of fish and not know it if they don’t know the name of the place.

29
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:59,509
That is why our ancestors named all their hunting places

30
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:03,711
Places with different kinds of food or fish. 

31
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:12,807
If a person doesn’t know that name of a river, he will not know if that place has fish. 

32
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:23,830
That is why we are told to learn all place names of rivers and lakes.

33
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:31,605
Places where we hunt for food, these are what was taught to us.

34
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:39,931
Also to know which lakes and rivers always have food. 

35
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:43,836
That place upriver “Ecuilnguq” always has fish.

36
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:50,669
Also I hear “Qagatmiut” area above us i always has fish.

37
00:04:50,985 --> 00:05:00,845
They taught us that streams with a strong current that flow from the mountains always have fish.

38
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:10,052
A person will survive if they stay with streams or rivers with strong “boiling” currents 

39
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:22,938
If we know of places like that we can fish with hook and line or use a net to try to survive,  that is what they told us.

40
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:36,371
They told us that when the water in the  Yukon river becomes dark, fish move to clearer waters, fish  enter clearer rivers.

41
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:43,702
Even these Yukon river fish die till there is no more fish.

42
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:53,881
And then when there is no more fish, they told us not to stay but to go to places that have black fish, places where black fish traps are set.

43
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:57,343
They told us also to go and try to survive at those places.

44
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:09,139
We not only hunted for our dog teams, we also hunted for ourselves.


45
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:17,672
They told us that these foxes and ravens are smart.

46
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:27,934
A fox and a raven will show you where there is food or fish, because there is nothing they don’t know.

47
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:39,164
They also told us to be watchful of foxes and ravens.

48
00:06:39,262 --> 00:06:41,612
These things are what was taught to us.

49
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:51,639
It is true that foxes show where there are fish. Ravens also show where there is food.

50
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:59,353
If we go to places where  foxes and ravens are, there is so much blackfish, then that is where we set our blackfish trap.

51
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:06,681
They also told us if to catch enough 

52
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:10,109
And to think of our communities.

53
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:21,689
Those people when  they were alive, they had love for each other. Love was their way. They loved each other.

54
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:30,339
They gave to each other without asking for payment, without asking for anything in return.

55
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:38,671
Sometimes troubles are many among us

56
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:44,688
Sometimes when we have a problem and ask for help, they tell us

57
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:52,114
“You helped me during a time when I needed help so now I am helping you as much as I can.”

58
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:56,826
They were not against each other, they loved each other.

59
00:07:56,837 --> 00:08:01,097
This is what they told me.

60
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:02,564
Is that all?

61
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:08,245
Yes. It will be enough.
