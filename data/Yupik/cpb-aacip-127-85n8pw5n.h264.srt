13
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:50,115
What about the schools today?

14
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:56,815
So much have changed since I first stepped into a classroom.

15
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:02,425
At one point, although some of us are not able to speak English

16
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:10,920
We were actually prohibited in some instances from speaking our language.

17
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:15,655
Yet, we didn’t know how to speak English.

18
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:24,385
Like I stated, so much have changed since that time.

19
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:35,000
Today, throughout my travels throughout the region, I’ve seen something called "bilingual education."

20
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:41,505
It’s my understanding that in these instances, that Yup’ik is taught

21
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:51,815
And that Yup’ik, in some instances, is actually encouraged to be spoken on school grounds under those circumstances.

22
00:02:54,915 --> 00:03:01,495
This is very encouraging because one of the basis of our society is our language.

23
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,780

31
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:36,460
One of the strongest sources of force known to mankind is words.

32
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:48,020
This source of force is known to all the societies, although they may not be able to communicate with each other.

33
00:04:48,385 --> 00:05:01,045
Yet, it’s the very words, that is one of the strongest sources of force in the universe.

34
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,390
Primarily because of the fact, when you say something using words

35
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:18,490
What you have stated forever escapes through your mouth to the people.

36
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,500
That’s why I think one must be very careful in their use of words

37
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:35,705
Because at some point, what you stated using words at some point may come back and haunt you.

What about respect?

47
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,525
We must respect our elders.

48
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:33,900
They alone are the people who can speak about life based on experiences of life.

49
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:47,055
When they’re speaking about life based on experience of life, you cannot be any stronger.

50
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:00,870
If we respect and listen to what they have to say

51
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:06,735
And perhaps remember a very little portion of what they have to say to us

52
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:16,030
We might find that living this life will be a little bit easier to cope with.

53
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:23,250
Remember, when they are giving us an advice

54
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:31,410
That advice is based on the very basis of their experience, and they want to share that with us.

55
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:35,695
We should be thankful for what they have to tell us.

71
00:10:57,985 --> 00:11:08,195
Thus far, I have been talking about the responsibilities of those of us who are young, maybe relatively young

72
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:15,915
And lastly, maybe for those of us who are young in mind, heart, and soul.

73
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:21,625
What about the elderly, or the elders?

74
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:30,325
What is their responsibility? Or, better yet, do they have any responsibility?

75
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:42,810
Yes, in my very humble opinion, they also have some responsibility to us.

76
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:57,385
They must speak out as a group about our cultural values

77
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:04,295
Before what is left of our values is gone.

78
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:16,475
I believe, again very humbly, that it is the responsibility of our elders

79
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,090
To teach us what we must do to continue with our values.

80
00:12:23,415 --> 00:12:32,535
But again, it is the responsibility of those of us who are young, relatively young, and young in mind

81
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:41,440
To hear and listen what they have to share with us.

82
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:58,215
I think when they’re talking about values, Yup’ik values

83
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:06,415
They’re talking about something that sometimes is hard to grab.

When I was a young man, one of the things that my grandfather taught me was how to go after game.

91
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:49,937
I was quite fortunate in that I had that privilege, I had the opportunity to be taught those skills.

92
00:14:52,719 --> 00:15:00,747
Whenever I have an opportunity, I try to share that, share what was taught to me.

93
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:04,904
But sometimes I don’t. That’s my fault

94
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:19,142
Although I was raised by my parents, I spent a lot of my time with my grandfather.

95
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:29,003
In looking back, I understand

96
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:46,396
That my grandmother used to teach values that should be respected and gained by the young ladies on how to be a lady.

What was taught to us by our elders is something that we should be sharing with others.

106
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:54,043
They taught us values of life, hoping that we’re going to be learning something in life.

107
00:17:55,663 --> 00:18:07,185
I think in turn, we must, we should and must teach the children what was taught to us by our elders.

108
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:18,047
There is a saying within the Yup’ik society that goes something like this:

109
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:26,051
"A person will not stop learning as long as they can breathe."

110
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:39,172
This is very true, because as I travel throughout the region, I’ve been adviced, or given advice by our elders

111
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:50,758
And I’ve learned on a daily basis what our way of life is.

112
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:58,817
I think if we are to continue with Yup’ik values

113
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:10,406
We must seek to learn all that we can from our elders, from others

114
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:19,386
As long as the Creator is generous enough to allow us to continue to breathe.

What I shared with you this morning was what was shared with me, or, what I had learned from our elders.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Kuskokwim Community College
