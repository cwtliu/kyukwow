8
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:45,585
Twelve years ago, I came to Alaska and went to the village of St. Mary’s to begin teaching.

9
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:51,289
And needless to say, I didn’t know much about Alaska.

10
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:54,028
I didn’t know much about Western Alaska.

11
00:00:55,105 --> 00:01:02,659
And I met, one of the first people I met was a nun, was a Catholic nun by the name of Sister Scholastica.

12
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:06,570
And some of you in this room know Sister Scholastica.

13
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:09,326
She’s still doing the laundry at St. Mary’s.

14
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:15,408
And she gave me the best advice that anyone ever gave me.

15
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:21,911
She said, "You’re new to Alaska. You don’t know anything about these people.

16
00:01:22,913 --> 00:01:30,278
"So what I want you to do is to say very little and to listen, because there’s a lot you need to learn."

17
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:38,215
And it was very, very good advice, because even now, twelve years later, I still find that I do too much talking and not enough listening

18
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:42,358
Because there’s still a lot that the elders of this area can teach us.

19
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:48,454

21
00:01:58,547 --> 00:02:08,095
When I was at St. Mary’s, I met students from all over, all over the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in the coast.

22
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:18,253
And in 1974, I had a class of students who I was particulary fond of.

23
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:22,532
And those are these students here.

24
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,263
And I promised them when I left St. Mary’s

25
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:34,370
That no matter where I went, I would always keep a picture of that class in my office, and I always have.

26
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:42,178
I lived in Juneau for a while, and I kept a picture of these students on my wall in Juneau. And now here in Bethel, I keep them on my wall.

27
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:50,543
And one of the reasons I do that, is because I look at these various individuals and I still keep in contact with them.

28
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:58,697
And it makes me realize how much things have changed in this area

29
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:02,496
Because I can see the change in these students as they grow up.

Pass this around. Some people want to see it.

34
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,361
When I look at the pictures of those students, and I think about what they’re doing now

35
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:42,758
One thought comes to mind...

36
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:48,441
...being happy, living at home, or living somewhere else, but happy with themselves.

37
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:56,810
Students who feel good about who they are are the students who did exactly what I think this conference is all about.

38
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,711
They’re the students who took time...

39
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:01,371
...people in their villages, and I really mean that.

40
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:06,113
When I look back, and I see the students again who are happy and successful...

41
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,514
...to learn from people who have lived a long time and have had many rich and wonderful experiences.

42
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:15,962
Tua-i-ll’...

43
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:20,276
I want to conclude by again welcoming you to this week.

44
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,455
I want to thank you for taking the time to be with us.

45
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,410
I’m very excited about it because this week, I get to be a student too.

46
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:37,118
I’m going to try to sit in on as many of the talks as possible so I can learn just along with everyone else.

47
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:44,457
So once again, I want to thank you for coming to Bethel, for sharing your experiences with us.

48
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:50,662
And if there’s anything I can do to make your stay happier and more enjoyable, please let me know.

64
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:09,534
For the benefit of those of you who have some limited understanding of the English language, let me paraphrase the main points.

65
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:19,633
Very recently, when Nastashia Martin called me to speak on the issue of how you could continue with the Yup’ik language

66
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:21,800
I’m sorry, Yup’ik values

67
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:28,928
Although I was enthusiastic about it, I also had some reservations

68
00:07:28,943 --> 00:07:36,808
Primarily because of the fact that I feel that it’s an issue that can best be addressed by our elders.

69
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:43,907
I am young, and because I am young, I feel that I have a lot to learn.

70
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:52,886
But I’m going to try my best under the circumstances.

71
00:07:53,808 --> 00:08:02,326
Very recently, there was a conference at Kassigluq where the elders of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta were the prime people who attended the conference.

72
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:07,176
Although I did not have the privilege of attending this conference

73
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:13,382
I understand that the main focus of the conference dealt with the issue of preserving our way of life.

74
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:20,248
I would like to have been there, however, circumstances sometimes relating with job prevents that.

96
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:22,221
I somehow feel that the main speaker this morning on this subject, how you could continue with Yup’ik values, should be one of the elders

97
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:33,626
Because in my opinion, they are the real people who should be giving us this guidance on the issue.

98
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:43,129
It is them who have given us guidance so that what is left of our values can be preserved.

99
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:49,999
It is them who had the wisdom to push for a Western type of education

100
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:55,846
So that we could be able to at least see and hopefully understand what is happening today.

101
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:11,062
For example, my grandfather Pavila who is from Qinaq was telling me that in his youth, when he was traveling throughout the region with a sled

102
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:15,877
That sometimes, he saw more than one white man in the whole region.

103
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:29,129
He said, however, in the late 1950’s, he said there are more and more of them in the region.

104
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:33,835
And sometimes, there are even more than one white person in a village.

105
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:44,379
He said at the time that you should learn their tongue, you should learn their language

106
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:49,684
So that you could at least understand what is it that you want.

107
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:59,192
It was through him that the wisdom of our elders was brought forth.

108
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:09,128
He saw much in advance, what was going to happen today.

109
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:17,748
I’m very thankful that through his wisdom that they pushed us for education.

110
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:22,316

129
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:48,280
As most of you may know, one of my major responsibilities with Calista Corporation is to run and manage Land and Natural Resources Department.

130
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:55,197
Land management in and of itself is not difficult.

131
00:16:57,754 --> 00:17:06,869
But if one were to look at land management strictly from standpoint of Western land management

132
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:22,935
However, it gets difficult when one begins to look at land from standpoint of Yup’ik values and trying to put Western values into it.

133
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:31,952
The very basis of our society is land, the Yup’ik society.

134
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:40,919
Our ancestors looked at land much the same way that we look at air we breathe today.

135
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,187
We need air to breathe so that we may survive.

136
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:56,429
In the beginning, and even today, the Yup’ik people has always been land users.

137
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:04,088
We survived with the land and what the land provided us.

138
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:08,473
Land provided us with clothing.

139
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:21,274
We needed to dress ourselves so that we can protect, we can be protected from any kind of weather.

140
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:29,407
Sea also provided us with clothing and food.

141
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:43,297
My point here being: land is something our society has needed and will probably need for long time to come to survive.

142
00:18:45,505 --> 00:18:55,560
What it has provided us, we must receive thankfully, humbly, and we must share that wealth with others.
