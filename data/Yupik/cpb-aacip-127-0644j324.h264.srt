Is the Coastal Yukon Villages Association have directed Mr. Troll and I to be a project director to have an activity like this during this year.

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:07,650
We were glad to be the directors and getting the support from the donors to have this activity available and made tonight.

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:20,490
One of most things that we’re glad about, we wanted to preserve our culture, both the language and the culture itself.

19
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:33,800
We want to show these kids, the young ones especially, through our actions we can show them that we really mean to preserve our language and culture.

20
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,380
If we do it ourselves, they will follow us.

21
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:44,030
We don’t have to tell them to go to the Eskimo dance, to go sing the song that the people are singing.

22
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:51,030
If we as elders and young men do it, they will follow us. We don’t have to tell them. We don’t have to push them.

23
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:58,195
If we ourselves show interest in preserving our culture, they will follow us too. Thank you.

...St. Mary’s, one of my jobs that I miss very dearly, is that I got to yell at the kids to be quiet. So you kids be quiet while I’m talking, alright?

88
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:04,635
I want all of you to know that this is only half of what this festival is about.

89
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:14,772
One of the important that we’re doing and that you’ve talked about tonight as elders, that it’s important to preserve your culture and pass it along to your children.

90
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:27,791
Well, these three days, you have an excellent opportunity, not only for dancing, but we have some artifacts and things that were collected by Sheldon Jackson 100 years ago from this area.

91
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,848
So it is very important, we want you elders to go up and see it.

92
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:40,298
If you know things about it, we want you to talk and talk, and tell your children about this.

93
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:44,149
These are things that you may remember from when you were kids.

94
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:52,024
The things you’re going to see up there are very, very interesting, and I think many of your children are not going to understand what they were for.

95
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,330
So it is very important for you to talk with them and see it.

96
00:12:56,349 --> 00:13:02,799
The exhibit will be open tomorrow at 9 o’clock, and will go until the potluck dinner at 3 o’clock.

97
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:06,118
Then it’ll be open from Sunday until we start dancing.

98
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:12,806
Now, I have a long list of thank-yous, but I’m going to do that tomorrow night and maybe the night after, so we can get right to dancing.

99
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:18,488
But one of the people I want to introduce and to at least acknowledge three, four people at this time.

100
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:28,682
One is the gentleman who’s sitting out back here in the corner. He looks like Kenny Rogers. That is Peter Corey. He is the curator of the Sheldon Jackson Museum in Sitka.

101
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:34,244
He has allowed all of these old things to come out here for you to see for the next three days.

102
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:42,363
When you go and see him tomorrow, if you know things, talk to him. Let him know things about the things that are there if you have information.

103
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:51,226
The other person I want to thank is Wassilie Evan. He went down to Sitka with me and helped select the artifacts that are there.

104
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:57,889
The other person is Willie Beans who’s kind of hiding back up there. But he also went down to Sitka to help pick...

And for all you people that’s going to be using the bathrooms back there...

116
00:15:06,765 --> 00:15:17,690
And also, all you tobacco chewers and snuff chewers, use those number 10 cans that are provided. Don’t use those pop cans, they spill too easy.

117
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,596
And before you go out, pick up your cans and throw them in the trash can. I don’t want to have to pick up your spit.

118
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:25,934
...in here, please.

119
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:38,797
And also transportation person is in charge is Mr. Demitry George, to the airport and within the local community.

120
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:46,959
And for safety factor, see these exit signs just in case there’s a fire.

121
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:49,340
Please don’t panic.

122

There’s double doors back here to go out, there’s the door where you came in, and this one here.
