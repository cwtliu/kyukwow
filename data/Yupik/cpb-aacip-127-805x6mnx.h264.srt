00:00:06,094 --> 00:00:12,805
[?] was saying [?]. You think it could be leukemia?

2
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:18,545
Or, she was [?] and her skin was really dark.

3
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:23,195
Auga-qaa assiinani?

4
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:29,048
Augani-wa apqucia uitaluni, assiinani, assirpek’nani.

5
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:31,589
It could be some other kind of sickness too.

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,986
We’re not enough of the story [?].

7
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:44,655
Makut-mi, [?] is that, they call them chickweed that we have growing?

8
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:49,029
It’s what I was just trying to get, but we’d have to see that.

9
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:58,151
I have bag of them out in my office, but they’re from Kass’aq store.

10
00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:03,145
But they really like those, those kind of flowers.

11
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:18,506
Yeah, but my friend got that tea for me, and looks really like that.

00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:38,188

17
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:02,151
I’m not a good translator.

18
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,270
No, it’s not that. Did she get sick after taking medicine?

19
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:07,667
No, she...

20
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:12,760
She was already sick from something in her blood. There was some disease in her blood.

21
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:16,696
[?] six months to a year.

22
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:30,101
Her hair was coming out. Her skin was turning dark.

23
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:33,109
Does that ring a bell?

24
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:36,117
And that’s when she started that medicine.

25
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:40,070
How long ago was this?

26
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:46,745

Has anybody ever heard of that?

58
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:22,691
...if they’ve used anything other than [?] oil or something.

59
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:24,192
Other than oil?

60
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,478
I mean, what was used traditionally.

61
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:31,973

She was talking about these kinds of bushes.

102
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:47,324
They could use these like I said, take out the bark, and take off the black part from the outside, and use it.

Well, that’s when it’s sore inside, and it turns like that, I think. It gets wrinkled. Your mouth is sore on the inside, and it gets to the point where it’s wrinkled like that.

107
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:25,792
When we use those, [?].

108
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:29,905
Peqlirnarqelluteng, I don’t know how you can describe that.

109
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:33,152
But they’re kind of strong.

110
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:38,010
When you put them in your mouth, they’re bitter, and they’re kind of...

111
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:41,061
...kinds for sores in the mouth.

112
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:50,400
And you can use them anytime, even in the summertime.

113
00:10:55,284 --> 00:11:03,306
When we’re playing outside when I was young, we used to eat the shoots from these kinds of trees.

114
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:06,390
You know the leaves that are just coming out?

115
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,904
We eat those.

116
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:13,718
And then those, there’s all kind of plants that you can eat.

117
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:17,469
And some of the plants that are dangerous

118
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:21,316
If you don’t know them, you don’t have to eat them.

119
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:27,506
But anyway, she didn’t mention those. But we used to eat...
