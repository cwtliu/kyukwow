19
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:15,605
Was when a person almost freezes or goes through hypothermia, when the body is already cool

20
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:27,279
She said the person who rescues that person or comes up to them would pee and let that person drink that urine.

Her husband got really frostbitten. He almost died. She doesn’t want to talk about it.

74
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:39,587
That reminds her of...

75
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:44,917
[?] there is treatment for frostbite.

76
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:55,067
Well, they, when I was younger, we used to have frostbites on our cheeks when we play too long outside.

77
00:08:55,377 --> 00:09:05,767
And then the old people would let us put a little bit snow on the frozen part for a while and then let it go.

78
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:14,042
And stay in the house and try to thaw it out with our hands, not by the stove.

79
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:24,052
Because they say when you put something warm on it, the cold part will go inside, and that’ll rot the skin.

80
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:28,342
So, that was the only thing we knew.

81
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:38,832
Do you know how the snow is supposed to help them...

82
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:43,637
I don’t know. They said it’s supposed to bring out the frozen part....

00:09:58,262 --> 00:10:02,782

88
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:59,552
He was gone since Saturday, and then my husband went out looking for his three-wheeler yesterday by plane.

Tua-llu he found three-wheeler somewhere between here and Atmaulluaq.

Then they started looking for him.

91
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:16,322
Every time when George lands, he was right there. He takes off, he never see him, he was right there, close to the three-wheeler.

92
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:25,012
They found him this morning. And they went out, and George brought him in, and he’s not supposed to carry passengers.

93
00:11:28,217 --> 00:11:29,877

He said she was still there, his mom and his sister were there.
