She’s teaching for hunting, walking.

106
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:09,935
No stove, just tent in the winter.

107
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:16,555
When you went to Heart, like, did you walk?

108
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,870
Nuu, by plane.

109
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,750
Oh, this time? Long time, a long time ago, though, did you walk?

110

111
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,660
She went Heart Lake in the winter?

112
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:35,435
Spring. (In the spring for the thaw?) Beaver hunting, that kind.

113
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:44,285
Now it’s, fall-ami tau͡gaam this year.

114
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,960
How many years, that was long time. Her daughter went up there.

115
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:54,205
I think [?] sickness.

116
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,800
They flew up this year?

117
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:13,145
Is the lake, the lake’s good now? There’s no big fish in the lake? It’s good? No...

118
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:19,515
She got lots of talaarit. Caulriit ima talaarit?

119

Trout-at-wa nanvani.

122
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:36,145
No big... (Citegnat.)

123
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:42,070
Small ones we’re fishing. (Citegnat.) We’re fishing, we’re eating small ones.

124
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:44,925
But no creatures in there like the stories anymore.

125
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:55,185
Sometime, her youngest brother, but way up from mountainside, he saw something bubbling the water.

126
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,820
And then he saw lots of spots.

127
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:06,610
Down, way down, it’s clear, you know, the clearest water?

128
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,480
Clear water?

129
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,590
Yaa, way down there, he saw the spots, black.

130
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,830
When was that?

131
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,830
Almost jump up.

132
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:18,475
This time? This trip?

133
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,530
Nuu, long time, her brother, when she was...

134
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,540
She’s in hospital now.

135
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:33,045
So did people get scared and stop going there, or people always went there?

136
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,310
But me, I’m scared I might eat airplane.

137
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:47,345
Really, I’m scared. We might eat.

138
00:13:48,195 --> 00:14:00,075
You ever, you or Wassilie ever hear of a stone face on top of a mountain by Kiseralik?

139
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,470
Stone head, face?

140
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,490
Nuu, I never go there, Kiillaraliin.

141
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:12,445
Can you ask him? A stone head by Kiseralik? Does he know? Can you ask?

142
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:13,925
What head?

143
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,300
Stone, rock, on top of a mountain.

144
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,450
I think, nuu, nalluaqa.

145
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:26,025
Did you know Old Man Reed had a mine up on the Kiseralik?

146
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,150
[?] I always went up, always [?].

147
