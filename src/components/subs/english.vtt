Sesame seeds

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:54.621 align:middle line:84%
I'm drinking hot americano this morning

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.024 align:middle line:84%
Hi everyone, good morning, it's 8:53 am

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:02.228 align:middle line:84%
This week, I want to record what I eat in a week

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.664 align:middle line:84%
What I eat on the weekdays

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:08.101 align:middle line:84%
I'll film everything I eat for you to see

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:84%
It is morning right now

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.772 align:middle line:84%
I'll have some coffee first, I'm not too hungry yet

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:23.216 align:middle line:84%
I don't have too much appetite

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:27.554 align:middle line:84%
Today’s lunch is the broccoli pasta that I shared with you before

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.689 align:middle line:84%
Broccoli pasta

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.058 align:middle line:84%
Focus

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:35.028 align:middle line:84%
The ingredients are super simple, just prepare a type of noodle that you like

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm using this noodle

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.898 align:middle line:84%
Then broccoli

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.401 align:middle line:84%
And cheese, I'm using this kind of powdered cheese

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.136 align:middle line:84%
It's better if you can buy the fresh one

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.838 align:middle line:84%
But because I don’t eat cheese that often

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:48.074 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid that if I buy the fresh one, it'll go bad if I don't use it

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:49.409 align:middle line:84%
So I'm using the powdered one instead

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.377 align:middle line:84%
And prepare some garlic

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:54.714 align:middle line:84%
Then some oil, I'm using avocado oil here

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:58.284 align:middle line:84%
Then with this kind of chili pepper

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.285 align:middle line:84%
Dried chili pepper

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.188 align:middle line:84%
This is super easy, it only takes about 15 minutes

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.023 align:middle line:84%
The majority of the time may be used to cook the noodle

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:19.239 align:middle line:84%
Let me start prepping

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:53.006 align:middle line:84%
(Stir-fried broccoli)

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:59.946 align:middle line:84%
(＋Water used to cook the noodle)

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:06.586 align:middle line:84%
Cheese, add a lot of cheese

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:31.744 align:middle line:84%
It's going to burnt

00:03:31.744 --> 00:04:16.022 align:middle line:84%
(Cheese pull~)

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:19.591 align:middle line:84%
Super delicious

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:42.181 align:middle line:84%
I ran out of cheese or I will add more

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:90%
A quick dish that I make for lunch very often!
(I planned to pack it for lunch for the next day, but we finished everything)

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:13.646 align:middle line:84%
(Fruit vinegar)

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:48.047 align:middle line:84%
(Continue working!)

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:50.416 align:middle line:84%
I'm having beef noodle soup tonight

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.752 align:middle line:84%
This is the beef that I marinated the day before

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:55.888 align:middle line:84%
I took some marinade out to make the beef noodle soup

00:05:55.888 --> 00:06:00.460 align:middle line:84%
The side dish today is the Taiwanese kimchi I made myself

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.165 align:middle line:84%
It’s cabbage pickled with vinegar, salt and sugar

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I also put some Sichuan pepper in it

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.103 align:middle line:84%
The Sichuan pepper makes a difference, I tried it myself

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:28.154 align:middle line:84%
Remember to add Sichuan pepper if you're trying next time

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:46.839 align:middle line:84%
(Very excited in the background)

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:53.079 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to add chili in yours?

00:06:53.079 --> 00:07:09.896 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm adding the Laoluozi garlic chili oil

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:12.832 align:middle line:84%
We're having beef noodle soup for dinner today

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And the Taiwanese kimchi that I made myself

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.877 align:middle line:84%
Wow the beef today is super delicious

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:32.518 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to add green onions or not?

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:36.289 align:middle line:84%
Taiwanese Kimchi

00:07:36.289 --> 00:08:08.187 align:middle line:84%
They go so well together

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:20.766 align:middle line:84%
It's almost 9am now

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:24.403 align:middle line:84%
I want to make lunch

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:28.908 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm eating this lobster that my friend recommended

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:31.744 align:middle line:84%
It's frozen lobster meat

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:84%
It's actually only 11am but I'm too hungry

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.583 align:middle line:84%
Let me look at the instructions

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:40.986 align:middle line:84%
Where is the lobster meat?

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Seasoning...

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:50.863 align:middle line:84%
Butter

00:08:50.863 --> 00:09:23.129 align:middle line:84%
(Very uncertain)

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:23.996 align:middle line:84%
Wow

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:47.053 align:middle line:84%
So pretty

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:49.622 align:middle line:84%
Assemble

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:52.959 align:middle line:84%
I want to add a little bit of this sauce that I like a lot

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:84%
This kind of Mexican style chili lime sauce

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:32.732 align:middle line:90%
(It goes really well with chicken nuggets too!)
It's a lime flavor

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:36.535 align:middle line:84%
It exploded

00:10:36.535 --> 00:11:08.434 align:middle line:84%
Looks super delicious

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:09.502 align:middle line:84%
Coffee

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:19.078 align:middle line:84%
(coffee time)

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:38.497 align:middle line:84%
This is Starbucks' nitro cold brew

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.933 align:middle line:84%
I bought this at Costco

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:51.877 align:middle line:84%
It's this kind of dried shiitake mushrooms

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:54.513 align:middle line:84%
It's good but a little too salty

00:11:54.513 --> 00:12:23.943 align:middle line:84%
I can’t eat a lot at a time

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:26.011 align:middle line:90%
(I'll look for snacks in the afternoon when working from home)
I’ll have a ferrero rocher

00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:28.748 align:middle line:90%
(I'll look for snacks in the afternoon when working from home)
Isn’t it obvious that it’s a lot less than yesterday

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:33.586 align:middle line:84%
I am eating this all by myself

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:56.142 align:middle line:84%
So pretty

00:12:56.142 --> 00:13:03.916 align:middle line:84%
(Using my free time in the afternoon to make the side dishes for dinner)

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:10.422 align:middle line:84%

Minced garlic

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:13.793 align:middle line:84%
Depending on how much you want to add

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I think American garlic is not too spicy and not too strong

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.065 align:middle line:84%
So I like to add a lot

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:46.292 align:middle line:84%
Then cover it

00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:52.865 align:middle line:84%
What?

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:55.734 align:middle line:84%
My radish soup is almost ready

00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:58.103 align:middle line:84%

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:38.677 align:middle line:84%
(First time making honey braised pork ribs)

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:47.286 align:middle line:84%
Wow it looks so pretty

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:49.355 align:middle line:84%
Today's dinner is done

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:51.223 align:middle line:84%
I'm having brown rice today

00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:53.726 align:middle line:84%

And the radish pork ribs soup with meatball

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:20.986 align:middle line:84%
A bit salty

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:24.556 align:middle line:84%
Good?

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Wow this cucumber is delicious

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.632 align:middle line:84%
Be careful, the chili pepper is very spicy

00:15:33.632 --> 00:15:37.736 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of chili pepper that is actually spicy

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:49.181 align:middle line:84%
Preserved egg with cucumber

00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I should take pictures and send to my mom

00:15:51.150 --> 00:16:02.728 align:middle line:84%
Let me grab my phone

(While brushing my teeth haha)

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Oh so hot

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:25.944 align:middle line:84%
Good morning

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:32.785 align:middle line:84%
It's 9:18am in the morning

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.353 align:middle line:84%
I want to eat breakfast today

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:47.099 align:middle line:84%
So I made some breakfast and want to eat it quickly

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:51.537 align:middle line:84%
Can you see Nana?

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:53.105 align:middle line:84%
Nana keeps looking at me from below

Nana

00:17:55.174 --> 00:18:14.159 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing?

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:17.529 align:middle line:84%
I feel that this avocado might be super ripe

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:19.798 align:middle line:84%
Forgot to eat it

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:22.701 align:middle line:84%
Hope it hasn't turned black

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:26.472 align:middle line:84%
Is it crooked?

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:29.241 align:middle line:84%
Wow it's so beautiful and soft

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:34.646 align:middle line:84%
Okay

00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:39.117 align:middle line:84%
I want to make a small burrito today

00:18:39.117 --> 00:18:51.563 align:middle line:84%
(Cilantro)

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:54.566 align:middle line:84%
I always look at what leftover we have in the fridge

00:18:54.566 --> 00:19:04.576 align:middle line:84%
Just throw in whatever I want to eat

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:06.612 align:middle line:84%
Cilantro

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:10.382 align:middle line:84%
I need to share this sauce with everyone

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:13.385 align:middle line:84%
This is Nando's peri-peri sauce

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:18.657 align:middle line:84%
Didn’t I go to live in Seattle for two weeks?

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:23.529 align:middle line:84%
Our family friends over there recommended this

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:24.897 align:middle line:84%
So I bought it

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:29.067 align:middle line:84%
It's really delicious, it goes really well with fried chicken

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:30.002 align:middle line:84%
That kind of sauce

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:33.772 align:middle line:84%
This is the hot flavor, let me show you

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:37.509 align:middle line:84%
I have another extra hot flavor

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.446 align:middle line:84%
I will eat this hot one first

00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:43.815 align:middle line:84%
I will add this hot sauce

00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:53.892 align:middle line:84%
Wow it's so fragrant

00:19:53.892 --> 00:20:00.966 align:middle line:84%
So delicious

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:17.783 align:middle line:84%
That sauce is so

00:20:17.783 --> 00:21:03.895 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to give you a bite but I added cilantro

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:11.570 align:middle line:84%
What is this?

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
What is this?

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not in focus

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.046 align:middle line:84%
Taiwan science noodles

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:25.784 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I also bought salted egg

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:30.689 align:middle line:84%
It's too delicious

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:33.825 align:middle line:84%
I think the company that makes Taiwan scientific noodle is really smart

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:38.597 align:middle line:84%
Has this product been popular for over 20 years?

00:21:38.597 --> 00:21:41.533 align:middle line:84%
Yes

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:45.637 align:middle line:84%
I like to eat Taiwan scientific noodle in bigger pieces

00:21:45.637 --> 00:22:15.033 align:middle line:84%
Not in small pieces

00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:17.369 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start making dinner now

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:33.819 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cut a lot of vegetable

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:36.421 align:middle line:84%
I'm making pork ribs now

00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:39.324 align:middle line:84%
And make it into pork ribs stewed with rice later

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:44.463 align:middle line:90%
(Pork ribs stewed with rice)
We have too many pork ribs

00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:49.101 align:middle line:90%
(Two dogs are home after a walk)
Aloha

00:22:49.101 --> 00:23:00.679 align:middle line:84%
Wow this is so greasy

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:08.453 align:middle line:84%
The lotus root is ready

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:22.901 align:middle line:84%
So good

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Cut it

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.545 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take a look at pork ribs stew with rice now

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:36.681 align:middle line:84%
Wow it smells so good

00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Looks super delicious

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:53.265 align:middle line:84%
I'm starving

00:23:53.265 --> 00:24:04.409 align:middle line:84%
It smells so good

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:09.648 align:middle line:84%
So pretty

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:11.349 align:middle line:84%
Dinner is done

00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:16.488 align:middle line:84%
This is the pork ribs stew with rice that I spent most of the time today making

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:20.125 align:middle line:84%
Then here are the same side dishes as yesterday

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:23.829 align:middle line:84%
Preserved eggs with cucumber and self-made Taiwanese kimchi

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:25.864 align:middle line:84%
And this is stir-fried vegetables I made today

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:29.601 align:middle line:84%
This is radish ribs soup with meatball from yesterday

00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:30.402 align:middle line:84%
What a long name

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:32.237 align:middle line:84%
Look, it's so pretty

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:36.374 align:middle line:84%
And this is the chicken cartilage that was air-fried just now

00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:42.013 align:middle line:84%
Wow, it's so pretty. I want to show it to my mom.

00:24:42.013 --> 00:24:42.981 align:middle line:84%
This rice

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:50.655 align:middle line:84%
Looks a lot like Taiwanese sticky rice

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:53.358 align:middle line:84%
So good

00:24:53.358 --> 00:25:07.072 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to grab a spatula?

00:25:07.072 --> 00:25:14.212 align:middle line:84%
This rice is so delicious

00:25:14.212 --> 00:25:18.083 align:middle line:84%
Bento

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:18.884 align:middle line:84%
Look on the side

00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:45.443 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing?

00:25:45.443 --> 00:25:47.279 align:middle line:84%
I am going to make a super quick lunch now

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:51.716 align:middle line:84%
I'm very happy just thinking about eating this dish

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:53.885 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you what I'm eating

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:56.087 align:middle line:84%
First, I heated some rice

00:25:56.087 --> 00:25:57.789 align:middle line:84%
Some white rice and brown rice

00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Because white rice is not enough

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.592 align:middle line:84%
And then

00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:02.527 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the key is this

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:84%
This is seasoned radish

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.466 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of Korean pickled radish

00:26:08.466 --> 00:26:10.835 align:middle line:84%
I think this brand is

00:26:10.835 --> 00:26:12.737 align:middle line:84%
From the three brands that I have eaten

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.806 align:middle line:84%
This is my favorite brand

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:18.276 align:middle line:84%
It's so good with rice

00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:19.611 align:middle line:84%
It's really delicious

00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:22.814 align:middle line:84%
This is already the fifth box I bought

00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:25.951 align:middle line:84%
It is sold at supermarkets or Weee

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:27.218 align:middle line:84%
It looks like this

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:29.254 align:middle line:84%
And then

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.623 align:middle line:84%
Basically

00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Just throw it in

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.858 align:middle line:84%
Can you see?

00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:38.930 align:middle line:84%
It’s super simple. When I don't have much time to make lunch

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.567 align:middle line:84%
I can quickly make this

00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:49.374 align:middle line:84%
The key is that its juice is very thick and delicious

00:26:49.374 --> 00:26:53.612 align:middle line:84%
I want to save a little bit for tomorrow

00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:56.514 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of sesame oil

00:26:56.514 --> 00:27:01.019 align:middle line:84%
I usually add a little sesame oil to my rice

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:04.956 align:middle line:84%
The key ingredient is seaweed flakes

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:09.394 align:middle line:84%
I'm adding the seaweed flakes from Bibigo

00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:10.795 align:middle line:84%
Depending on how much you want to add

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I like to add a lot

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:16.868 align:middle line:84%
Next step is to give it a good stir

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:29.614 align:middle line:84%
When it's done it'll look super delicious

00:27:29.614 --> 00:27:40.859 align:middle line:84%
Give it a good stir

00:27:40.859 --> 00:28:11.089 align:middle line:84%
(Happy lunch time)

00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:14.159 align:middle line:84%
Hi everyone, I am going to make dinner now

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:16.528 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to continue making ribs for dinner today

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:20.465 align:middle line:84%
Because I defrosted a whole pack of ribs that day

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:22.333 align:middle line:84%
There are four big rows of ribs

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:25.303 align:middle line:84%
I used three of them yesterday and the day before yesterday

00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:27.105 align:middle line:84%
So I will finish the last one today

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:32.343 align:middle line:84%
Besides the ribs, I plan to make dry noodles with sauce

00:28:32.343 --> 00:28:37.382 align:middle line:84%
Then maybe just add some cucumbers, and some shredded eggs

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:40.018 align:middle line:84%
Mix it with the dry noodles with sauce and pork ribs

00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:42.087 align:middle line:84%
And the leftover soup from the day before

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:43.788 align:middle line:84%
I've had it for three days now and we need to finish it today

00:28:43.788 --> 00:28:44.889 align:middle line:84%
I'm still debating

00:28:44.889 --> 00:28:46.324 align:middle line:84%
The dog keeps staring at me

00:28:46.324 --> 00:28:49.527 align:middle line:84%
I'm still debating whether to air-fry the chicken cartilage like yesterday

00:28:49.527 --> 00:28:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Because it's pretty good

00:28:51.930 --> 00:29:00.004 align:middle line:84%
Let me see

00:29:00.004 --> 00:29:04.676 align:middle line:84%
I prepared some shredded chicken breast

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:06.211 align:middle line:84%
I'm using the... hold on

00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:09.114 align:middle line:84%
I'm using this one from Costco

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:84%
They're in these pieces so I cut them smaller

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I can throw them into the dry noodles with sauce later

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.556 align:middle line:84%
I also prepared a big pot of vegetables here

00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:20.358 align:middle line:84%
I'll just stir-fry it later

00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:22.794 align:middle line:84%
So today’s diner includes soup and dry noodles with sauce

00:29:22.794 --> 00:29:24.629 align:middle line:84%
Stir-fry some vegetables with the pork ribs

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:26.998 align:middle line:84%
This should be enough

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:49.154 align:middle line:84%
(Making the sauce for the dry noodles~)

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:84%
The key is the sesame seeds

00:29:52.190 --> 00:30:01.232 align:middle line:84%
After sprinkling on some sesame seeds, it looks more professional

00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Shredded egg

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.068 align:middle line:84%
Chicken

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:05.804 align:middle line:84%
That chicken breast

00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:10.375 align:middle line:84%
Momoya Spicy Chili Sauce that I shared before

00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:13.511 align:middle line:84%
It's very fragrant but not spicy at all

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:40.405 align:middle line:84%
I can use it up today

00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:42.607 align:middle line:84%
Dinner is ready

00:30:42.607 --> 00:30:45.243 align:middle line:84%
For dinner today, we have a bowl of soba noodles

00:30:45.243 --> 00:30:47.278 align:middle line:84%
And a bowl of white noodles because we don't have enough noodles

00:30:47.278 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Then vegetables

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.449 align:middle line:84%
And this is the pickled preserved egg with cucumber from a few days ago

00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Tea

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.819 align:middle line:84%
We need to finish this pork ribs soup quickly

00:30:54.819 --> 00:31:05.163 align:middle line:84%
I also made a new batch of honey braised pork ribs

00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:07.966 align:middle line:84%
I also added the chicken from Costco

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:20.578 align:middle line:84%
So smart

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:24.349 align:middle line:84%
I want to add more chili

00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:26.651 align:middle line:84%
I've been loving this chili powder recently

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:43.768 align:middle line:84%
Almost

00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:46.037 align:middle line:84%
Good morning everybody

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:49.240 align:middle line:84%
It's almost half past seven in the morning

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.278 align:middle line:84%
I want to make some congee for breakfast today

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:58.149 align:middle line:90%
(Shrimp, cabbage and salted egg congee)
I am starving now and I want to eat a hot bowl of congee

00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:59.684 align:middle line:84%
I just realized that my vegetables

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:04.789 align:middle line:84%
Because the fridge is too cold, the vegetables have frozen

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:07.592 align:middle line:84%
I'll cut some Chinese cabbage

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:13.398 align:middle line:84%
The cabbage seems frozen

00:32:13.398 --> 00:32:15.066 align:middle line:84%
I want to add salted eggs today

00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:17.201 align:middle line:84%
I am in love with salted eggs recently

00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:21.306 align:middle line:84%
A few days ago I even

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I ate a salted egg when I had nothing to do in the afternoon

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.416 align:middle line:84%
The congee looks like this now

00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:34.052 align:middle line:84%
It should be ready in about two minutes

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:35.453 align:middle line:84%
Make it a little bit thicker

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:46.197 align:middle line:84%
I also added a little bit of cooked multigrain rice

00:32:46.197 --> 00:32:50.268 align:middle line:84%
I just cut the shrimp into small pieces

00:32:50.268 --> 00:33:09.887 align:middle line:84%
Like this

00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:31.042 align:middle line:90%
(Done)
It looks super delicious

00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:41.152 align:middle line:84%
The spicy radish from yesterday

00:33:41.152 --> 00:33:43.755 align:middle line:84%
Is it in focus?

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:49.794 align:middle line:84%
I can eat this again on the weekend

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:52.163 align:middle line:84%
Scared me

00:33:52.163 --> 00:34:11.916 align:middle line:84%
OK

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:20.224 align:middle line:90%
(It's so good! The salted egg added so much flavor)
Wow, it's delicious with the salted egg

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:39.243 align:middle line:84%
Added a little radish kimchi on top

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.911 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I can add preserved eggs in next time

00:34:40.911 --> 00:35:02.133 align:middle line:84%
I think preserved eggs and salted eggs will go really well together

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:04.368 align:middle line:84%
It's been pretty hot here in the Bay Area

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:07.071 align:middle line:84%
I'm mostly wearing short sleeves

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:19.984 align:middle line:84%
Coffee

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:21.919 align:middle line:84%
Guava

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:24.088 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cut it and eat it right after

00:35:24.088 --> 00:35:25.289 align:middle line:84%
I've been waiting for guava for a long time

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:28.993 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of Asian pears

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:29.760 align:middle line:84%
What is this?

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:39.036 align:middle line:84%
Nana it's your favorite Asian pear

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:42.139 align:middle line:84%
Hand pulled scallion pancake

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:49.547 align:middle line:84%
A bag of fresh noodle

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:53.518 align:middle line:84%
And a bag of edamame

00:35:53.518 --> 00:36:07.064 align:middle line:84%
Nana, what is this?

00:36:07.064 --> 00:36:17.875 align:middle line:84%
What a beautiful guava

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:21.646 align:middle line:84%
Asian pear and guava

00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:28.586 align:middle line:84%
These two are my favorite fruits

00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:31.789 align:middle line:84%
Asian pear

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:33.024 align:middle line:84%
So juicy

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:54.745 align:middle line:84%
Snack time

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:59.283 align:middle line:90%
(Can't stop eating)
I'm going to eat this taro pastry later

00:36:59.283 --> 00:37:01.352 align:middle line:84%
Is it in focus? Is it?

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:02.286 align:middle line:84%
This taro pastry

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:05.523 align:middle line:84%
I love the egg yolk pastry from the same brand

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:22.573 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had their taro pastry before

00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:24.642 align:middle line:84%
So pretty

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:27.445 align:middle line:84%
Can you see?

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:36.921 align:middle line:84%
Air-fry it for a bit

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:47.665 align:middle line:84%
Smells so good

00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:53.537 align:middle line:84%
It feels like there is a taro paste inside

00:37:53.537 --> 00:37:58.342 align:middle line:84%
It's not overly sweet either

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:01.245 align:middle line:84%
Oh there's mochi inside

00:38:01.245 --> 00:38:07.118 align:middle line:84%
The white thing

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I feel that if you pair it with some hot tea

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:14.625 align:middle line:84%
Will go really well together

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:32.009 align:middle line:84%
I finished it in one go

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Elle

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.184 align:middle line:84%
(Friday dinner - my friends came to our house for dinner)

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:43.187 align:middle line:84%
(We ordered fried chicken + cooked instant ramen together)

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:48.187 align:middle line:84%
(Thank you for watching, see you in the next video~)
